A storm in which\nhailstones fall is a ‘hailstorm’. You know that a storm is bad weather with\nstrong winds, rain, thunder and lightning.\n\nThere are different names in different parts of the world for storms,\ndepending on their nature.

Notice how the word ‘hope’ is used in these sentences from the story:\n\n(a) I hope it (the hailstorm) passes quickly.\n(b) There was a single hope: help from God.\n\nIn the first example, ‘hope’ is a verb which means you wish for something to\nhappen. In the second example it is a noun meaning a chance for something\nto happen.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nMatch the sentences in Column A with the meanings of ‘hope’ in Column B.\nA B\n\n[ a) : ‘-\nWill you get the subjects you want a feeling that something good will\nto study in college? probably happen\nI hope so. thinking that this would happen\nI hope you don’t mind my saying (It may or may not have happened.)\nthis, but I don’t like the way you stopped believing that this good\nare arguing. thing would happen\nThis discovery will give new hope wanting something to happen\nto HIV/AIDS sufferers.

Relative Clauses\nLook at these sentences\n\n(a) All morning Lencho — who knew his fields intimately — looked at\nthe sky.\n(b) The woman, who was preparing supper, replied, “Yes, God willing.”\nThe italicised parts of the sentences give us more information about Lencho\nand the woman. We call them relative clauses. Notice that they begin with\n\na relative pronoun who. Other common relative pronouns are whom, whose,\nand which.\n\nThe relative clauses in (a) and (b) above are called non-defining, because\nwe already know the identity of the person they describe. Lencho is a\nparticular person, and there is a particular woman he speaks to. We don’t\nneed the information in the relative clause to pick these people out from a\nlarger set.\n\n9\n>\n=\na\na\nLe 3\nSo\na\n=)\net\n\nA non-defining relative clause usually has a comma in front of it and a\ncomma after it (some writers use a dash (—) instead, as in the story). If the\nrelative clause comes at the end, we just put a full stop.\n\nJoin the sentences given below using who, whom, whose, which, as\nsuggested.\n1. I often go to Mumbai. Mumbai is the commercial capital of India. (which)\n\n2. My mother is going to host a TV show on cooking. She cooks very\nwell. (who)\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nFirst Flight\n\n~\n9S\n\n3. These sportspersons are going to meet the President. Their performance\nhas been excellent. (whose)\n\n4. Lencho prayed to God. His eyes see into our minds. (whose)\n5. This man cheated me. I trusted him. (whom)\nSometimes the relative pronoun in a relative clause remains ‘hidden’. For\nexample, look at the first sentence of the story:\n(a) The house — the only one in the entire valley — sat on the crest of a\nlow hill.\nWe can rewrite this sentence as:\n\n(b) The house — which was the only one in the entire valley — sat on\nthe crest of a low hill.\n\nIn (a), the relative pronoun which and the verb was are not present.\n\n. Using Negatives for Emphasis\n\nWe know that sentences with words such as no, not or nothing show the\nabsence of something, or contradict something. For example:\n\n(a) This year we will have no corn. (Corn will be absent)\n(b) The hail has left nothing. (Absence of a crop)\n\n(c) These aren’t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins.\n(Contradicts the common idea of what the drops of water falling from\nthe sky are)\n\nBut sometims negative words are used just to emphasise an idea. Look at\nthese sentences from the story:\n\n(d) Lencho...had done nothing else but see the sky towards the north-\neast. (He had done only this)\n\n(e) The man went out for no other reason than to have the pleasure of\nfeeling the rain on his body. (He had only this reason)\n\n(f) Lencho showed not the slightest surprise on seeing the money.\n(He showed no surprise at all)\n\nNow look back at example (c). Notice that the contradiction in fact serves to\nemphasise the value or usefulness of the rain to the farmer.\n\nFind sentences in the story with negative words, which express the\nfollowing ideas emphatically.\n\n1. The trees lost all their leaves.\n\n2. The letter was addressed to God himself.\n\n3. The postman saw this address for the first time in his career.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nV. Metaphors\n\nThe word metaphor comes from a Greek word meaning ‘transfer’. Metaphors\n\ncompare two things or ideas: a quality or feature of one thing is transferred\n\nto another thing. Some common metaphors are\n\ne the leg of the table: The leg supports our body. So the object that supports\na table is described as a leg.\n\n¢ the heart of the city: The heart is an important organ in the centre of our\nbody.

I wish I had the faith of the man who wrote this letter. Starting up a correspondence with God!” So, in order not to shake the writer’s faith in God, the postmaster came up with an idea: answer the letter. But when he opened it, it was evident that to answer it he needed something more than goodwill, ink and paper. But he stuck to his resolution: he asked for money from his employees, he himself gave part of his salary, and several friends of his were obliged to give something ‘for an act of charity’. It was impossible for him to gather together the hundred pesos, so he was able to send the farmer only a little more than half. He put the money in an envelope addressed to Lencho and with it a letter containing only a single word as a signature: God. Oral Comprehension Check 1. Who or what did Lencho have faith in? What did he do? 2. Whoread the letter? 3. What did the postmaster do then? The following Sunday Lencho came a bit earlier than usual to ask if there was a letter for him. It was the postman himself who handed the letter to him while the postmaster, experiencing the contentment of a man who has_ performed a good deed, looked on from his office. Lencho showed not the slightest surprise on seeing the money; such was his confidence — but he became angry when he counted the money. God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested. Immediately, Lencho went up to the window to ask for paper and ink. On the public writing-table, he started to write, with much wrinkling of his brow, caused by the effort he had to make to express his ideas. When he finished, he went to the window to buy a stamp which he licked and then affixed to Reprint 2O25-26 contentment satisfaction the envelope with a blow of his fist. The moment the letter fell into the mailbox the postmaster went to open it. It said: “God: Of the money that I asked for, only seventy pesos reached me. Send me the rest, since I need it very much.

How are these conflicts illustrated? Thinking about — I. First Flight oo — — Look at the following sentence from the story. Suddenly a strong wind began to blow and along with the rain very large hailstones began to fall. ‘Hailstones’ are small balls of ice that fall like rain. A storm in which hailstones fall is a ‘hailstorm’. You know that a storm is bad weather with strong winds, rain, thunder and lightning.

A violent storm with very strong winds, especially in the western Atlantic Ocean: r 6. A very strong wind that moves very fast in a spinning movement and causes a lot of damage: 1 . Notice how the word ‘hope’ is used in these sentences from the story: (a) I hope it (the hailstorm) passes quickly. (b) There was a single hope: help from God. In the first example, ‘hope’ is a verb which means you wish for something to happen. In the second example it is a noun meaning a chance for something to happen.

Relative Clauses Look at these sentences (a) All morning Lencho — who knew his fields intimately — looked at the sky. (b) The woman, who was preparing supper, replied, “Yes, God willing.” The italicised parts of the sentences give us more information about Lencho and the woman. We call them relative clauses. Notice that they begin with a relative pronoun who. Other common relative pronouns are whom, whose, and which. The relative clauses in (a) and (b) above are called non-defining, because we already know the identity of the person they describe. Lencho is a particular person, and there is a particular woman he speaks to. We don’t need the information in the relative clause to pick these people out from a larger set. 9 > = a a Le 3 So a =) et A non-defining relative clause usually has a comma in front of it and a comma after it (some writers use a dash (—) instead, as in the story). If the relative clause comes at the end, we just put a full stop. Join the sentences given below using who, whom, whose, which, as suggested. 1. I often go to Mumbai. Mumbai is the commercial capital of India. (which) 2. My mother is going to host a TV show on cooking. She cooks very well. (who) Reprint 2O25-26 First Flight ~ 9S 3. These sportspersons are going to meet the President. Their performance has been excellent. (whose) 4. Lencho prayed to God. His eyes see into our minds. (whose) 5. This man cheated me. I trusted him. (whom) Sometimes the relative pronoun in a relative clause remains ‘hidden’. For example, look at the first sentence of the story: (a) The house — the only one in the entire valley — sat on the crest of a low hill. We can rewrite this sentence as: (b) The house — which was the only one in the entire valley — sat on the crest of a low hill. In (a), the relative pronoun which and the verb was are not present. . Using Negatives for Emphasis We know that sentences with words such as no, not or nothing show the absence of something, or contradict something. For example: (a) This year we will have no corn. (Corn will be absent) (b) The hail has left nothing. (Absence of a crop) (c) These aren’t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins. (Contradicts the common idea of what the drops of water falling from the sky are) But sometims negative words are used just to emphasise an idea. Look at these sentences from the story: (d) Lencho...had done nothing else but see the sky towards the north- east. (He had done only this) (e) The man went out for no other reason than to have the pleasure of feeling the rain on his body. (He had only this reason) (f) Lencho showed not the slightest surprise on seeing the money. (He showed no surprise at all) Now look back at example (c). Notice that the contradiction in fact serves to emphasise the value or usefulness of the rain to the farmer. Find sentences in the story with negative words, which express the following ideas emphatically. 1. The trees lost all their leaves. 2. The letter was addressed to God himself. 3. The postman saw this address for the first time in his career. Reprint 2O25-26 V. Metaphors The word metaphor comes from a Greek word meaning ‘transfer’. Metaphors compare two things or ideas: a quality or feature of one thing is transferred to another thing. Some common metaphors are e the leg of the table: The leg supports our body. So the object that supports a table is described as a leg. ¢ the heart of the city: The heart is an important organ in the centre of our body. So this word is used to describe the central area of a city. In pairs, find metaphors from the story to complete the table below. Try to say what qualities are being compared.

Love, Jaya What You Can Do Before You Read: Encourage students to share their ideas about what will happen in the story. Activity: Before filling out the form, get the students to read through the form and decide which parts they should fill out, and which parts will be filled in by the postal department. Ask a few students to volunteer to actually send a money order (the amount need not be large) and share the experience with the rest of the class. Reading: Break the text up into manageable chunks for reading (three paragraphs, for example), and encourage students to read silently, on their own. Give them enough time to read, and then discuss what they have read before going on to the next portion. Use the ‘Oral Comprehension Checks’ in the appropriate places, and use the ‘Thinking about the Text’ questions at the end of the passage to help them go beyond the text. Grammar: After they have done the exercise, ask students to make their own sentences with non-defining relative clauses — for example, ‘Meena, who's a very clever girl, is always first in class.’ Or, ‘Our gardener, who knows a lot about plants, loves to talk about them.’ Speaking: Take the first turn — talk to the students about an instance from your own life, or from that of someone you know.

Why doesn’t the poet write about a more ‘beautiful’ tree such as a maple, or an oak, or a pine? (iii) What do the ‘crow’ and ‘hemlock’ represent — joy or sorrow?

Relative Clauses\nLook at these sentences\n\n(a) All morning Lencho — who knew his fields intimately — looked at\nthe sky.\n(b) The woman, who was preparing supper, replied, “Yes, God willing.”\nThe italicised parts of the sentences give us more information about Lencho\nand the woman. We call them relative clauses. Notice that they begin with\n\na relative pronoun who. Other common relative pronouns are whom, whose,\nand which.\n\nThe relative clauses in (a) and (b) above are called non-defining, because\nwe already know the identity of the person they describe.

What is the “glorious ...\n\nhuman achievement” he speals of at the end?\n\n4. What does Mandela thank the international leaders for?\n5. What ideals does he set out for the future of South Africa?\n\nA few moments later we all lifted our eyes in\nawe as a spectacular array of South African jets,\nhelicopters and troop carriers roared in perfect\nformation over the Union Buildings. It was not only\na display of pinpoint precision and military force,\nbut a demonstration of the military’s loyalty to\ndemocracy, to a new government that had been\nfreely and fairly elected. Only moments before, the\nhighest generals of the South African defence force\nand police, their chests bedecked with ribbons and\nmedals from days gone by, saluted me and pledged\ntheir loyalty. I was not unmindful of the fact that\nnot so many years before they would not have\nsaluted but arrested me. Finally a chevron of Impala\njets left a smoke trail of the black, red, green, blue\nand gold of the new South African flag.\n\nThe day was symbolised for me by the playing of\nour two national anthems, and the vision of whites\nsinging ‘Nkosi Sikelel —iAfrika’ and blacks singing\n‘Die Stem’, the old anthem of the Republic. Although\nthat day neither group knew the lyrics of the anthem\nthey once despised, they would soon know the\nwords by heart.\n\nOn the day of the inauguration, I was\noverwhelmed with a sense of history. In the first\ndecade of the twentieth century, a few years after\nthe bitter Anglo-Boer war and before my own birth,\nthe white-skinned peoples of South Africa patched\nup their differences and erected a system of racial\ndomination against the dark-skinned peoples of their\nown land.

Now, in the\nlast decade of the twentieth century, and my own\neighth decade as a man, that system had been\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\\by\n\ncw]\n\nspectacular array\nan impressive\ndisplay (colourful\nand attractive)\n\nnot unmindful of\nconscious of; aware of\n\nchevron\na pattern in the\nshape of a V 1\n\nNs)\n\ndespised\nhad a very low\nopinion of\n\nMLO posi 07 TPA buoy “Spepeel wOSTP Ny\n\n\nFirst Flight\n\noverturned forever and replaced by one that\nrecognised the rights and freedoms of all peoples,\nregardless of the colour of their skin.\n\nThat day had come about through the\nunimaginable sacrifices of thousands of my people,\npeople whose suffering and courage can never be\ncounted or repaid. I felt that day, as I have on so\nmany other days, that I was simply the sum of all\nthose African patriots who had gone before me. That\nlong and noble line ended and now began again\nwith me. I was pained that I was not able to thank\nthem and that they were not able to see what their\nsacrifices had wrought.\n\nThe policy of apartheid created a deep and lasting\nwound in my country and my people. All of us will\nspend many years, if not generations, recovering\nfrom that profound hurt. But the decades of\noppression and brutality had another, unintended,\neffect, and that was that it produced the Oliver\nTambos, the Walter Sisulus, the Chief Luthulis, the\nYusuf Dadoos, the Bram Fischers, the Robert\nSobukwes of our time* — men of such extraordinary\n\nalm %\n\ne- >\nOliver Tambo Walter Sisulu Chief Luthuli\n\na\n\nBah\n\nYusuf Dadoo Bram Fischer Robert Sobulcwe\n\n* These are some prominent names in the struggle against apartheid.\n\nwrought (old\nfashioned, formal\nword)\n\ndone, achieved\n\nprofound\ndeep and strong\n\n(For the use of the definite article with proper nouns, see exercise II on page 25)\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\ncourage, wisdom and generosity that their like may\nnever be known again. Perhaps it requires such\ndepths of oppression to create such heights of\ncharacter. My country is rich in the minerals and\ngems that lie beneath its soil, but I have always\nknown that its greatest wealth is its people, finer\nand truer than the purest diamonds.\nIt is from these comrades in the struggle that I\nlearned the meaning of courage. Time and again, I\nhave seen men and women risk and give their lives\nfor an idea. I have seen men stand up to attacks\nand torture without breaking, showing a strength\nand resilience that defies the imagination. I learned resilience\nthat courage was not the absence of fear, but the the ability to deal\ntriumph over it. The brave man is not he who does vain Kind cos\nnot feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. from its effects\nNo one is born hating another person because of\nthe colour of his skin, or his background, or his\nreligion. People must learn to hate, and if they can\nlearn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love\ncomes more naturally to the human heart than its\nopposite.

But\nin a country like South Africa, it was almost\nimpossible for a man of my birth and colour to fulfil\nboth of those obligations. In South Africa, a man of\ncolour who attempted to live as a human being was\npunished and isolated. In South Africa, a man who\ntried to fulfil his duty to his people was inevitably\nripped from his family and his home and was forced\nto live a life apart, a twilight existence of secrecy\nand rebellion. I did not in the beginning choose to\nplace my people above my family, but in attempting\nto serve my people, I found that I was prevented\nfrom fulfilling my obligations as a son, a brother, a\nfather and a husband.\n\nI was not born with a hunger to be free. I was born\nfree — free in every way that I could know. Free to\nrun in the fields near my mother’s hut, free to swim\nin the clear stream that ran through my village, free\nto roast mealies under the stars and ride the broad\nbacks of slow-moving bulls. As long as I obeyed my\nfather and abided by the customs of my tribe, I was\nnot troubled by the laws of man or God.\n\nIt was only when I began to learn that my boyhood\nfreedom was an illusion, when I discovered as a\nyoung man that my freedom had already been taken\nfrom me, that I began to hunger for it. At first, as a\nstudent, I wanted freedom only for myself, the\ntransitory freedoms of being able to stay out at night,\nread what I pleased and go where I chose.

Can you say which of the three countries named below had such a political system until very recently? United States of America (ti) South Africa (iii) Australia e Have you heard of Nelson Mandela? Mandela, and his African National Congress, spent a lifetime fighting against apartheid. Mandela had to spend thirty years in prison. Finally, democratic elections were held in South Africa in 1994, and Mandela became the first black President of a new nation. In this extract from his autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, Mandela speaks about a historic occasion, ‘the inauguration’. Can you guess what the occasion might be? Check your guess with this news item (from the BBC) of 1O May 1994. Mandela Becomes South Africa’s First Black President Nelson Mandela has become South Africa’s first Black President after more than three centuries of White rule. Mr Mandela’s African National Congress (ANC) party won 252 of the 4OO seats in the first democratic elections of South Africa’s history. The inauguration ceremony took place in the Union Buildings amphitheatre in Pretoria today, attended by politicians and dignitaries from more than 14O countries around the world. “Never, never again will this beautiful land experience the oppression of one by another, ” said Nelson Mandela in his address. ...

What does Mandela thank the international leaders for? 5. What ideals does he set out for the future of South Africa? A few moments later we all lifted our eyes in awe as a spectacular array of South African jets, helicopters and troop carriers roared in perfect formation over the Union Buildings. It was not only a display of pinpoint precision and military force, but a demonstration of the military’s loyalty to democracy, to a new government that had been freely and fairly elected. Only moments before, the highest generals of the South African defence force and police, their chests bedecked with ribbons and medals from days gone by, saluted me and pledged their loyalty. I was not unmindful of the fact that not so many years before they would not have saluted but arrested me. Finally a chevron of Impala jets left a smoke trail of the black, red, green, blue and gold of the new South African flag. The day was symbolised for me by the playing of our two national anthems, and the vision of whites singing ‘Nkosi Sikelel —iAfrika’ and blacks singing ‘Die Stem’, the old anthem of the Republic. Although that day neither group knew the lyrics of the anthem they once despised, they would soon know the words by heart. On the day of the inauguration, I was overwhelmed with a sense of history. In the first decade of the twentieth century, a few years after the bitter Anglo-Boer war and before my own birth, the white-skinned peoples of South Africa patched up their differences and erected a system of racial domination against the dark-skinned peoples of their own land. The structure they created formed the basis of one of the harshest, most inhumane, societies the world has ever known. Now, in the last decade of the twentieth century, and my own eighth decade as a man, that system had been Reprint 2O25-26 \\by cw] spectacular array an impressive display (colourful and attractive) not unmindful of conscious of; aware of chevron a pattern in the shape of a V 1 Ns) despised had a very low opinion of MLO posi O7 TPA buoy “Spepeel wOSTP Ny First Flight overturned forever and replaced by one that recognised the rights and freedoms of all peoples, regardless of the colour of their skin. That day had come about through the unimaginable sacrifices of thousands of my people, people whose suffering and courage can never be counted or repaid. I felt that day, as I have on so many other days, that I was simply the sum of all those African patriots who had gone before me. That long and noble line ended and now began again with me. I was pained that I was not able to thank them and that they were not able to see what their sacrifices had wrought. The policy of apartheid created a deep and lasting wound in my country and my people. All of us will spend many years, if not generations, recovering from that profound hurt. But the decades of oppression and brutality had another, unintended, effect, and that was that it produced the Oliver Tambos, the Walter Sisulus, the Chief Luthulis, the Yusuf Dadoos, the Bram Fischers, the Robert Sobukwes of our time* — men of such extraordinary alm % e- > Oliver Tambo Walter Sisulu Chief Luthuli a Bah Yusuf Dadoo Bram Fischer Robert Sobulcwe * These are some prominent names in the struggle against apartheid. wrought (old fashioned, formal word) done, achieved profound deep and strong (For the use of the definite article with proper nouns, see exercise II on page 25) Reprint 2O25-26 courage, wisdom and generosity that their like may never be known again. Perhaps it requires such depths of oppression to create such heights of character. My country is rich in the minerals and gems that lie beneath its soil, but I have always known that its greatest wealth is its people, finer and truer than the purest diamonds. It is from these comrades in the struggle that I learned the meaning of courage. Time and again, I have seen men and women risk and give their lives for an idea. I have seen men stand up to attacks and torture without breaking, showing a strength and resilience that defies the imagination. I learned resilience that courage was not the absence of fear, but the the ability to deal triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does vain Kind cos not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. from its effects No one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite. Even in the grimmest times in prison, when my comrades and I were pushed to our limits, Iwould pushed to our see a glimmer of humanity in one of the guards, !imits perhaps just for a second, but it was enough to aes ee te fe reassure me and keep me going.

But in a country like South Africa, it was almost impossible for a man of my birth and colour to fulfil both of those obligations. In South Africa, a man of colour who attempted to live as a human being was punished and isolated. In South Africa, a man who tried to fulfil his duty to his people was inevitably ripped from his family and his home and was forced to live a life apart, a twilight existence of secrecy and rebellion. I did not in the beginning choose to place my people above my family, but in attempting to serve my people, I found that I was prevented from fulfilling my obligations as a son, a brother, a father and a husband. I was not born with a hunger to be free. I was born free — free in every way that I could know. Free to run in the fields near my mother’s hut, free to swim in the clear stream that ran through my village, free to roast mealies under the stars and ride the broad backs of slow-moving bulls. As long as I obeyed my father and abided by the customs of my tribe, I was not troubled by the laws of man or God. It was only when I began to learn that my boyhood freedom was an illusion, when I discovered as a young man that my freedom had already been taken from me, that I began to hunger for it. At first, as a student, I wanted freedom only for myself, the transitory freedoms of being able to stay out at night, read what I pleased and go where I chose. Later, as a young man in Johannesburg, I yearned for the basic and honourable freedoms of achieving my potential, of earning my keep, of marrying and having a family — the freedom not to be obstructed in a lawful life. But then I slowly saw that not only was I not free, but my brothers and sisters were not free. I saw that it was not just my freedom that was curtailed, but the freedom of everyone who looked like I did.

It was this desire for the freedom of my people to live their lives with dignity and self- respect that animated my life, that transformed a frightened young man into a bold one, that drove a law-abiding attorney to become a criminal, that turned a family-loving husband into a man without a home, that forced a life-loving man to live like a monk. I am no more virtuous or self-sacrificing than the next man, but I found that I could not even enjoy the poor and limited freedoms I was allowed when I knew my people were not free. Freedom is indivisible; the chains on anyone of my people were the chains on all of them, the chains on all of my people were the chains on me. I knew that the oppressor must be liberated just as surely as the oppressed. A man who takes away another man’s freedom is a prisoner of hatred; he is locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrow- mindedness. I am not truly free if I am taking away someone else’s freedom, just as surely as I am not free when my freedom is taken from me. The oppressed and the oppressor alike are robbed of their humanity.

Reprint 2O25-26 A Tiger in the Loo This poem contrasts a tiger in the zoo with the tiger in its natural habitat. The poem moves from the zoo to the jungle, and back again to the zoo. Read the poem silently once, and say which stanzas speak about the tiger in the zoo, and which ones speak about the tiger in the jungle. He stalks in his vivid stripes The few steps of his cage, On pads of velvet quiet, In his quiet rage. He should be lurking in shadow, Sliding through long grass Near the water hole Where plump deer pass. He should be snarling around houses At the jungle’s edge, Baring his white fangs, his claws, Terrorising the village! But he’s locked in a concrete cell, His strength behind bars, Stalking the length of his cage, Ignoring visitors. He hears the last voice at night, The patrolling cars, And stares with his brilliant eyes At the brilliant stars.

(i) Find the words that describe the movements and actions of the tiger in the cage and in the wild. Arrange them in two columns. (ii) Find the words that describe the two places, and arrange them in two columns. Now try to share ideas about how the poet uses words and images to contrast the two situations. 2. Notice the use of a word repeated in lines such as these: (i) On pads of velvet quiet, In his quiet rage. (ii) And stares with his brilliant eyes At the brilliant stars. What do you think is the effect of this repetition? 3. Read the following two poems — one about a tiger and the other about a panther. Then discuss: Are zoos necessary for the protection or conservation of some species of animals? Are they useful for educating the public? Are there alternatives to zoos? The Tiger The tiger behind the bars of his cage growls, The tiger behind the bars of his cage snarls, The tiger behind the bars of his cage roars. Then he thinks. It would be nice not to be behind bars all The time Because they spoil my view I wish I were wild, not on show. But if I were wild, hunters might shoot me, But if I were wild, food might poison me, But if I were wild, water might drown me. Then he stops thinking And...

It seems to him there are a thousand bars; and behind the bars, no world. As he paces in cramped circles, over and over, the movement of his powerful soft strides is like a ritual dance around a centre in which a mighty will stands paralysed.

Here are two stories about flying.\n\nI. Ayoung seagull is afraid to fly. How does he conquer his fear?\n\nII. A pilot is lost in storm clouds. Does he arrive safe? Who helps\n\nhim?\n\nI\nHis First Flight\n\nTHE young seagull was alone on his ledge. His two\nbrothers and his sister had already flown away the\nday before. He had been afraid to fly with them.\nSomehow when he had taken a little run forward to\nthe brink of the ledge and attempted to flap his\nwings he became afraid. The great expanse of sea\nstretched down beneath, and it was such a long\nway down — miles down. He felt certain that his\nwings would never support him; so he bent his head\nand ran away back to the little hole under the ledge\nwhere he slept at night. Even when each of his\nbrothers and his little sister, whose wings were far\nshorter than his own, ran to the brink, flapped their\nwings, and flew away, he failed to muster up courage\nto take that plunge which appeared to him so\ndesperate. His father and mother had come around\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nledge\n\na narrow horizontal\nshelf projecting from\na wall or (here) a cliff\n\n\ncalling to him shrilly, upbraiding him, threatening\nto let him starve on his ledge unless he flew away.\nBut for the life of him he could not move.\n\nThat was twenty-four hours ago. Since then\nnobody had come near him. The day before, all day\nlong, he had watched his parents flying about with\nhis brothers and sister, perfecting them in the art\nof flight, teaching them how to skim the waves and\nhow to dive for fish. He had, in fact, seen his older\nbrother catch his first herring and devour it,\nstanding on a rock, while his parents circled around\nraising a proud cackle. And all the morning the\nwhole family had walked about on the big plateau\nmidway down the opposite cliff taunting him with\nhis cowardice.\n\nThe sun was now ascending the sky, blazing on\nhis ledge that faced the south. He felt the heat\nbecause he had not eaten since the previous nightfall.\n\nHe stepped slowly out to the brink of the ledge,\nand standing on one leg with the other leg hidden\nunder his wing, he closed one eye, then the other,\n\nupbraiding\nscolding\n\n(to) skim\n\nto move lightly just\nabove a surface\n(here, the sea)\n\nherring\na soft-finned sea fish\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nxs\n\n|\n\nbul] 7 ynoqe say omy,\n\n\nFirst Flight\n\nand pretended to be falling asleep. Still they took\nno notice of him. He saw his two brothers and his\nsister lying on the plateau dozing with their heads\nsunk into their necks. His father was preening the\nfeathers on his white back. Only his mother was\nlooking at him. She was standing on a little high\nhump on the plateau, her white breast thrust\nforward. Now and again, she tore at a piece of fish\nthat lay at her feet and then scrapped each side of\nher beak on the rock. The sight of the food maddened\nhim. How he loved to tear food that way, scrapping\nhis beak now and again to whet it.\n\n“Ga, ga, ga,” he cried begging her to bring him\nsome food. “Gaw-col-ah,” she screamed back\nderisively. But he kept calling plaintively, and\nafter a minute or so he uttered a joyful scream.\nHis mother had picked up a piece of the fish and\nwas flying across to him with it.

But when\nshe was just opposite to him, she halted, her\nwings motionless, the piece of fish in her beak\nalmost within reach of his beak. He waited a\nmoment in surprise, wondering why she did not\ncome nearer, and then, maddened by hunger, he\ndived at the fish. With a loud scream he fell\noutwards and downwards into space. Then a\nmonstrous terror seized him and his heart stood\nstill. He could hear nothing. But it only lasted a\nminute. The next moment he felt his wings spread\noutwards. The wind rushed against his breast\nfeathers, then under his stomach, and against his\nwings. He could feel the tips of his wings cutting\nthrough the air. He was not falling headlong now.\nHe was soaring gradually downwards and outwards.\nHe was no longer afraid. He just felt a bit dizzy.\nThen he flapped his wings once and he soared\nupwards. “Ga, ga, ga, Ga, ga, ga, Gaw-col-ah,” his\nmother swooped past him, her wings making a\nloud noise. He answered her with another scream.\nThen his father flew over him screaming. He saw\nhis two brothers and his sister flying around him\ncurveting and banking and soaring and diving.\n\nThen he completely forgot that he had not always\nbeen able to fly, and commended himself to dive\nand soar and curve, shrieking shrilly.\n\nHe was near the sea now, flying straight over\nit, facing straight out over the ocean. He saw a\nvast green sea beneath him, with little ridges\nmoving over it and he turned his beak sideways\nand cawed amusedly.\n\nHis parents and his brothers and sister had\nlanded on this green flooring ahead of him. They\nwere beckoning to him, calling shrilly. He dropped\nhis legs to stand on the green sea. His legs sank\ninto it. He screamed with fright and attempted to\nrise again flapping his wings.

I was happy to be\nalone high up above the sleeping countryside. I was\nflying my old Dakota aeroplane over France back to\nEngland. I was dreaming of my holiday and looking\nforward to being with my family. I looked at my\nwatch: one thirty in the morning.\n\n‘T should call Paris Control soon,’ I thought. As I\nlooked down past the nose of the aeroplane, I saw\nthe lights of a big city in front of me. I switched on\nthe radio and said, “Paris Control, Dakota DS 088\nhere. Can you hear me? I’m on my way to England.\nOver.”\n\nThe voice from the radio answered me immediately:\n“DS 088, I can hear you. You ought to turn twelve\ndegrees west now, DS 088. Over.”\n\nI checked the map and the compass, switched\nover to my second and last fuel tank, and turned\nthe Dakota twelve degrees west towards England.\n\nTll be in time for breakfast,’ I thought. A good\nbig English breakfast! Everything was going well —\nit was an easy flight.\n\nParis was about 150 kilometres behind me when\nI saw the clouds. Storm clouds. They were huge.\nThey looked like black mountains standing in front\nof me across the sky. I knew I could not fly up and\nover them, and I did not have enough fuel to fly\naround them to the north or south.\n\n“I ought to go back to Paris,” I thought, but I\nwanted to get home. I wanted that breakfast.\n\nTll take the risk,’ I thought, and flew that old\nDakota straight into the storm.\n\nInside the clouds, everything was suddenly black.\nIt was impossible to see anything outside the\naeroplane. The old aeroplane jumped and twisted\nin the air. I looked at the compass.

The\nother instruments were suddenly dead, too. I tried\nthe radio.\n\n“Paris Control? Paris Control? Can you hear me?”\n\nThere was no answer. The radio was dead too. I\nhad no radio, no compass, and I could not see where\nI was. I was lost in the storm. Then, in the black\nclouds quite near me, I saw another aeroplane. It\nhad no lights on its wings, but I could see it flying\nnext to me through the storm. I could see the pilot’s\nface — turned towards me. I was very glad to see\nanother person. He lifted one hand and waved.\n\n“Follow me,” he was saying. “Follow me.”\n\n‘He knows that I am lost,’ I thought. ‘He’s trying\nto help me.’\n\nHe turned his aeroplane slowly to the north, in\nfront of my Dakota, so that it would be easier for\nme to follow him. I was very happy to go behind the\nstrange aeroplane like an obedient child.\n\nAfter half an hour the strange black aeroplane\nwas still there in front of me in the clouds. Now\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nthere was only enough fuel in the old Dakota’s last\ntank to fly for five or ten minutes more. I was\nstarting to feel frightened again. But then he started\nto go down and I followed through the storm.\n\nSuddenly I came out of the clouds and saw two\nlong straight lines of lights in front of me. It was a\nrunway! An airport! I was safe! I turned to look for\nmy friend in the black aeroplane, but the sky was\nempty. There was nothing there. The black\naeroplane was gone. I could not see it anywhere.\n\nI landed and was not sorry to walk away from the\nold Dakota near the control tower. I went and asked\na woman in the control centre where I was and who\nthe other pilot was. I wanted to say ‘Thank you’.\n\nShe looked at me very strangely, and then\nlaughed.\n\n“Another aeroplane? Up there in this storm? No\nother aeroplanes were flying tonight. Yours was the\nonly one I could see on the radar.”\n\nSo who helped me to arrive there safely without\na compass or a radio, and without any more fuel in\nmy tanks?

Here are two stories about flying. I. Ayoung seagull is afraid to fly. How does he conquer his fear? II. A pilot is lost in storm clouds. Does he arrive safe? Who helps him? I His First Flight THE young seagull was alone on his ledge. His two brothers and his sister had already flown away the day before. He had been afraid to fly with them. Somehow when he had taken a little run forward to the brink of the ledge and attempted to flap his wings he became afraid. The great expanse of sea stretched down beneath, and it was such a long way down — miles down. He felt certain that his wings would never support him; so he bent his head and ran away back to the little hole under the ledge where he slept at night. Even when each of his brothers and his little sister, whose wings were far shorter than his own, ran to the brink, flapped their wings, and flew away, he failed to muster up courage to take that plunge which appeared to him so desperate. His father and mother had come around Reprint 2O25-26 ledge a narrow horizontal shelf projecting from a wall or (here) a cliff calling to him shrilly, upbraiding him, threatening to let him starve on his ledge unless he flew away. But for the life of him he could not move. That was twenty-four hours ago. Since then nobody had come near him. The day before, all day long, he had watched his parents flying about with his brothers and sister, perfecting them in the art of flight, teaching them how to skim the waves and how to dive for fish. He had, in fact, seen his older brother catch his first herring and devour it, standing on a rock, while his parents circled around raising a proud cackle. And all the morning the whole family had walked about on the big plateau midway down the opposite cliff taunting him with his cowardice. The sun was now ascending the sky, blazing on his ledge that faced the south. He felt the heat because he had not eaten since the previous nightfall. He stepped slowly out to the brink of the ledge, and standing on one leg with the other leg hidden under his wing, he closed one eye, then the other, upbraiding scolding (to) skim to move lightly just above a surface (here, the sea) herring a soft-finned sea fish Reprint 2O25-26 xs I bul] 7 ynoqe say omy, First Flight and pretended to be falling asleep. Still they took no notice of him. He saw his two brothers and his sister lying on the plateau dozing with their heads sunk into their necks. His father was preening the feathers on his white back. Only his mother was looking at him. She was standing on a little high hump on the plateau, her white breast thrust forward. Now and again, she tore at a piece of fish that lay at her feet and then scrapped each side of her beak on the rock. The sight of the food maddened him. How he loved to tear food that way, scrapping his beak now and again to whet it. “Ga, ga, ga,” he cried begging her to bring him some food. “Gaw-col-ah,” she screamed back derisively. But he kept calling plaintively, and after a minute or so he uttered a joyful scream. His mother had picked up a piece of the fish and was flying across to him with it. He leaned out preening making an effort to maintain feathers (to) whet to sharpen derisively in a manner showing someone that she/he is stupid Reprint 2O25-26 eagerly, tapping the rock with his feet, trying to get nearer to her as she flew across. But when she was just opposite to him, she halted, her wings motionless, the piece of fish in her beak almost within reach of his beak. He waited a moment in surprise, wondering why she did not come nearer, and then, maddened by hunger, he dived at the fish. With a loud scream he fell outwards and downwards into space. Then a monstrous terror seized him and his heart stood still. He could hear nothing. But it only lasted a minute. The next moment he felt his wings spread outwards. The wind rushed against his breast feathers, then under his stomach, and against his wings. He could feel the tips of his wings cutting through the air. He was not falling headlong now. He was soaring gradually downwards and outwards. He was no longer afraid. He just felt a bit dizzy. Then he flapped his wings once and he soared upwards. “Ga, ga, ga, Ga, ga, ga, Gaw-col-ah,” his mother swooped past him, her wings making a loud noise. He answered her with another scream. Then his father flew over him screaming. He saw his two brothers and his sister flying around him curveting and banking and soaring and diving. Then he completely forgot that he had not always been able to fly, and commended himself to dive and soar and curve, shrieking shrilly. He was near the sea now, flying straight over it, facing straight out over the ocean. He saw a vast green sea beneath him, with little ridges moving over it and he turned his beak sideways and cawed amusedly. His parents and his brothers and sister had landed on this green flooring ahead of him. They were beckoning to him, calling shrilly. He dropped his legs to stand on the green sea. His legs sank into it. He screamed with fright and attempted to rise again flapping his wings.

He was floating on it, and around him his family was screaming, praising him and their beaks were offering him scraps of dog-fish. He had made his first flight. 1 Thos about the Text j 1. Why was the young seagull afraid to fly? Do you think all young birds are afraid to make their first flight, or are some birds more timid than others? Do you think a human baby also finds it a challenge to take its first steps? “The sight of the food maddened him.” What does this suggest? What compelled the young seagull to finally fly? “They were beckoning to him, calling shrilly.” Why did the seagull’s father and mother threaten him and cajole him to fly? Have you ever had a similar experience, where your parents encouraged you to do something that you were too scared to try? Discuss this in pairs or groups. In the case of a bird flying, it seems a natural act, and a foregone conclusion that it should succeed. In the examples you have given in answer to the previous question, was your success guaranteed, or was it important for you to try, regardless of a possibility of failure? Speaking We have just read about the first flight of a young seagull. Your teacher will now divide the class into groups. Each group will work on one of the following topics.

Reprint 2O25-26 II The Black Aeroplane THE moon was coming up in the east, behind me, and stars were shining in the clear sky above me. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky. I was happy to be alone high up above the sleeping countryside. I was flying my old Dakota aeroplane over France back to England. I was dreaming of my holiday and looking forward to being with my family. I looked at my watch: one thirty in the morning. ‘T should call Paris Control soon,’ I thought. As I looked down past the nose of the aeroplane, I saw the lights of a big city in front of me. I switched on the radio and said, “Paris Control, Dakota DS O88 here. Can you hear me? I’m on my way to England. Over.” The voice from the radio answered me immediately: “DS O88, I can hear you. You ought to turn twelve degrees west now, DS O88. Over.” I checked the map and the compass, switched over to my second and last fuel tank, and turned the Dakota twelve degrees west towards England. Tll be in time for breakfast,’ I thought. A good big English breakfast! Everything was going well — it was an easy flight. Paris was about 15O kilometres behind me when I saw the clouds. Storm clouds. They were huge. They looked like black mountains standing in front of me across the sky. I knew I could not fly up and over them, and I did not have enough fuel to fly around them to the north or south. “I ought to go back to Paris,” I thought, but I wanted to get home. I wanted that breakfast. Tll take the risk,’ I thought, and flew that old Dakota straight into the storm. Inside the clouds, everything was suddenly black. It was impossible to see anything outside the aeroplane. The old aeroplane jumped and twisted in the air. I looked at the compass. I couldn’t believe Reprint 2O25-26 37 bul] 7 ynoge say omy, First Flight Ts a) my eyes: the compass was turning round and round and round. It was dead. It would not work! The other instruments were suddenly dead, too. I tried the radio. “Paris Control? Paris Control? Can you hear me?” There was no answer. The radio was dead too. I had no radio, no compass, and I could not see where I was. I was lost in the storm. Then, in the black clouds quite near me, I saw another aeroplane. It had no lights on its wings, but I could see it flying next to me through the storm. I could see the pilot’s face — turned towards me. I was very glad to see another person. He lifted one hand and waved. “Follow me,” he was saying. “Follow me.” ‘He knows that I am lost,’ I thought. ‘He’s trying to help me.’ He turned his aeroplane slowly to the north, in front of my Dakota, so that it would be easier for me to follow him. I was very happy to go behind the strange aeroplane like an obedient child. After half an hour the strange black aeroplane was still there in front of me in the clouds. Now Reprint 2O25-26 there was only enough fuel in the old Dakota’s last tank to fly for five or ten minutes more. I was starting to feel frightened again. But then he started to go down and I followed through the storm. Suddenly I came out of the clouds and saw two long straight lines of lights in front of me. It was a runway! An airport! I was safe! I turned to look for my friend in the black aeroplane, but the sky was empty. There was nothing there. The black aeroplane was gone. I could not see it anywhere. I landed and was not sorry to walk away from the old Dakota near the control tower. I went and asked a woman in the control centre where I was and who the other pilot was. I wanted to say ‘Thank you’. She looked at me very strangely, and then laughed. “Another aeroplane? Up there in this storm? No other aeroplanes were flying tonight. Yours was the only one I could see on the radar.” So who helped me to arrive there safely without a compass or a radio, and without any more fuel in my tanks? Who was the pilot on the strange black aeroplane, flying in the storm, without lights?

Describe the narrator’s experience as he flew the aeroplane into the storm. Why does the narrator say, “I landed and was not sorry to walk away from the old Dakota...”? What made the woman in the control centre look at the narrator strangely? Who do you think helped the narrator to reach safely? Discuss this among yourselves and give reasons for your answer. Thinking about — I. Study the sentences given below. (a) They looked like black mountains. (b) Inside the clouds, everything was suddenly black. (c) In the black clouds near me, I saw another aeroplane. (d) The strange black aeroplane was there. The word ‘black’ in sentences (a) and (c) refers to the very darkest colour. But in (b) and (d) (here) it means without light/with no light. ‘Black’ has a variety of meanings in different contexts. For example: (a) ‘I prefer black tea’ means ‘I prefer tea without milk’. (b) ‘With increasing pollution the future of the world is black means ‘With increasing pollution the future of the world is very depressing/ without hope’. Now, try to guess the meanings of the word ‘black’ in the sentences given below. Check the meanings in the dictionary and find out whether you have guessed right. 1. Go and have a bath; your hands and face are absolutely black. 2. The taxi-driver gave Ratan a black look as he crossed the road when the traffic light was green. 3. The bombardment of Hiroshima is one of the blackest crimes against humanity. 4. Very few people enjoy Harold Pinter’s black comedy. 5. Sometimes shopkeepers store essential goods to create false scarcity and then sell these in black. 6. Villagers had beaten the criminal black and blue. Reprint 2O25-26 F II. Look at these sentences taken from the lesson you have just read: (a) I was flying my old Dakota aeroplane. (b) The young seagull had been afraid to fly with them. In the first sentence the author was controlling an aircraft in the air. Another example is: Children are flying kites. In the second sentence the seagull was afraid to move through the air, using its wings. Match the phrases given under Column A with their meanings given under Column B: A B Fly a flag Move quickly/suddenly Fly into rage Be successful Fly along Display a flag on a long pole Fly high Escape from a place Fly the coop Become suddenly very angry Ill.

As persecutions\n_Anne Frank, 10 October 1942. against the Jewish population\nincreased, the family went into\nhiding in July 1942 in hidden rooms in her father Otto Frank’s\noffice building. After two years in hiding, the group was betrayed\nand transported to the concentration camp system where Anne died\nof typhus in Bergen-Belsen within days of her sister, Margot Frank.\nHer father, Otto, the only survivor of the group, returned to Amsterdam\nafter the war ended, to find that her diary had been saved. Convinced\nthat it was a unique record, he took action to have it published in\nEnglish under the name The Diary of a Young Girl.\nThe diary was given to Anne Frank for her thirteenth birthday\nand chronicles the events of her life from 12 June 1942 until its\nJinal entry of 1 August 1944. It was eventually translated from its\noriginal Dutch into many languages and became one of the world’s\nmost widely read books. There have also been several films,\ntelevision and theatrical productions, and even an opera, based on\nthe diary. Described as the work of a mature and insightful mind,\nthe diary provides an intimate examination of daily life under Nazi\noccupation.

Oh well, it doesn’t matter. I feel like\nwriting, and I have an even greater need to get all\nkinds of things off my chest.\n\n‘Paper has more patience than people.’ I thought\nof this saying on one of those days when I was feeling\na little depressed and was sitting at home with my\nchin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering\nwhether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I\nwas, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience,\nand since I’m not planning to let anyone else read\nthis stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a\n‘diary’, unless I should ever find a real friend, it\nprobably won’t make a bit of difference.\n\nNow I’m back to the point that prompted me\nto keep a diary in the first place: I don’t have a\nfriend.\n\nLet me put it more clearly, since no one will\nbelieve that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely\nalone in the world. And I’m not. I have loving parents\nand a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about\nthirty people I can call friends. I have a family,\nloving aunts and a good home.

The\nreason, of course, is the forthcoming meeting in\nwhich the teachers decide who'll move up to the\nnext form and who'll be kept back. Half the class is\nmaking bets. G.N. and I laugh ourselves silly at the\ntwo boys behind us, C.N. and Jacques, who have\nstaked their entire holiday savings on their bet.\nFrom morning to night, it’s “You’re going to pass”,\n“No, ’'m not”, “Yes, you are”, “No, I’m not”. Even G.’s\npleading glances and my angry outbursts can’t calm\nthem down. If you ask me, there are so many\ndummies that about a quarter of the class should\nbe kept back, but teachers are the most\nunpredictable creatures on earth.\n\nI'm not so worried about my girlfriends and\nmyself. We'll make it. The only subject I’m not sure\nabout is maths. Anyway, all we can do is wait. Until\nthen, we keep telling each other not to lose heart.\n\nI get along pretty well with all my teachers. There\nare nine of them, seven men and two women. Mr\nKeesing, the old fogey who teaches maths, was\nannoyed with me for ages because I talked so much.\nAfter several warnings, he assigned me extra\nhomework. An essay on the subject, ‘A Chatterbox’.\nA chatterbox — what can you write about that? I'd\nworry about that later, I decided. I jotted down the\ntitle in my notebook, tucked it in my bag and tried\nto keep quiet.\n\nThat evening, after I’d finished the rest of my\nhomework, the note about the essay caught my eye.\nI began thinking about the subject while chewing\nthe tip of my fountain pen. Anyone could ramble on\nand leave big spaces between the words, but the\ntrick was to come up with convincing arguments to\nprove the necessity of talking. I thought and\nthought, and suddenly I had an idea. I wrote the\nthree pages Mr Keesing had assigned me and was\nsatisfied. I argued that talking is a student’s trait\nand that I would do my best to keep it under control,\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nquaking in its boots\nshaking with fear\nand nervousness\n\nold fogey\nan old-fashioned\nperson\n\nramble on\ntalk or write\naimlessly for long\n\nconvincing\nargument\n\na statement made in\nsuch a manner that\npeople believe it\n\n\nbut that I would never be able to cure myself of the\nhabit since my mother talked as much as I did if\nnot more, and that there’s not much you can do\nabout inherited traits.\n\nMr Keesing had a good laugh at my arguments,\nbut when I proceeded to talk my way through the\nnext lesson, he assigned me a second essay. This\ntime it was supposed to be on ‘An Incorrigible\nChatterbox’. I handed it in, and Mr Keesing had\nnothing to complain about for two whole lessons.\nHowever, during the third lesson he’d finally had\nenough. “Anne Frank, as punishment for talking in\nclass, write an essay entitled — ‘Quack, Quack,\nQuack, Said Mistress Chatterbox’.” __\n\ninherited traits\nqualities (physical or\nmental) that one gets\nfrom one’s parents\n\nincorrigible\nsomething that\ncannot be corrected\n(usually a bad\nquality)\n\nThe class roared.

My friend,\nSanne, who’s good at poetry, offered to help me write\nthe essay from beginning to end in verse and I\njumped for joy. Mr Keesing was trying to play a\njoke on me with this ridiculous subject, but I’d make\nsure the joke was on him.\n\nI finished my poem, and it was beautiful!

(Phrasal\nverbs can also be idioms; they are said to be ‘idiomatic’ when their meaning\nis unpredictable.) For example, do you know what it means to ‘meet one’s\nmatch’ in English? It means to meet someone who is as good as oneself, or\neven better, in some skill or quality. Do you know what it means to ‘let the\ncat out of the bag’? Can you guess?\n\n1.

Do you know how to use a dictionary to find out the meanings of idiomatic\nexpressions? Take, for example, the expression caught my eye in the story.\nWhere — under which word — would you look for it in the dictionary?\n\nLook for it under the first word. But if the first word is a ‘grammatical’ word\nlike a, the, for, etc., then take the next word. That is, look for the first\n‘meaningful’ word in the expression. In our example, it is the word caught.\n\nBut you won't find caught in the dictionary, because it is the past tense of\ncatch. You'll find caught listed under catch. So you must look under catch for\nthe expression caught my eye. Which other expressions with catch are listed\nin your dictionary?\n\nNote that a dictionary entry usually first gives the meanings of the word\nitself, and then gives a list of idiomatic expressions using that word.

Contracted Forms\nWhen we speak, we use ‘contracted forms’ or short forms such as these:\ncan’t (for can not or cannot) Id (for Iwould or Ihad) _ she’s (for she is)\nNotice that contracted forms are also written with an apostrophe to show a\nshortening of the spelling of not, would, or is as in the above example.\n\nWriting a diary is like speaking to oneself. Plays (and often, novels) also have\nspeech in written form. So we usually come across contracted forms in\ndiaries, plays and novels.\n\n1. Make a list of the contracted forms in the text. Rewrite them as full\nforms of two words.\nFor example:\nI've = I have\n2. We have seen that some contracted forms can stand for two different\nfull forms:\nI'd =I had or I would\n\nFind in the text the contracted forms that stand for two different\nfull forms, and say what these are.\n\nSpeaking 4\n\nHere is an extract adapted from a one-act play. In this extract, angry neighbours\nwho think Joe the Inventor’s new spinning machine will make them lose their\njobs come to destroy Joe’s model of the machine.\n\nYou've just seen how contracted forms can make a written text sound like actual\nspeech. Try to make this extract sound more like a real conversation by changing\nsome of the verbs back into contracted forms. Then speak out the lines.\n\n[The door is flung open, and several men tramp in. They carry sticks, and one\nof them, Hos, has a hammer.]\n\nMos : Now where is your husband, mistress?\nMary : In his bed. He is sick, and weary.

Can you keep a diary for a\nweek recording the events that occur? You may share your diary with your\nclass, if you wish to. Use the following hints to write your diary.\n\n¢ Though your diary is very private, write as if you are writing for someone else.\ne Present your thoughts in a convincing manner.\n\n¢ Use words that convey your feelings, and words that ‘paint pictures’ for the\nreader. Be brief.\n\n‘Diary language’ has some typical features such as subjectless sentences (Got\nup late in the morning), sentence fragments without subjects or verbs (...too\nbad, boring, not good), contracted forms (they're, I’ve, can’t, didn’t, etc.), and\neveryday expressions which people use in speech.

Discuss with your\nstudents diaries which became historical documents, such as Samuel Pepys’s diary.\nYou may draw students’ attention to different types of diaries, e.g. private diary,\ngeneral diary.

Her family had moved to Amsterdam after the Nazis gained power in Germany but were trapped when I the Nazi occupation extended into would, maybe, have a chance ; to come to Hollywood.” the Netherlands. As persecutions _Anne Frank, 1O October 1942. against the Jewish population increased, the family went into hiding in July 1942 in hidden rooms in her father Otto Frank’s office building. After two years in hiding, the group was betrayed and transported to the concentration camp system where Anne died of typhus in Bergen-Belsen within days of her sister, Margot Frank. Her father, Otto, the only survivor of the group, returned to Amsterdam after the war ended, to find that her diary had been saved. Convinced that it was a unique record, he took action to have it published in English under the name The Diary of a Young Girl. The diary was given to Anne Frank for her thirteenth birthday and chronicles the events of her life from 12 June 1942 until its Jinal entry of 1 August 1944. It was eventually translated from its original Dutch into many languages and became one of the world’s most widely read books. There have also been several films, television and theatrical productions, and even an opera, based on the diary. Described as the work of a mature and insightful mind, the diary provides an intimate examination of daily life under Nazi occupation. Anne Frank has become one of the most renowned and discussed of the Holocaust victims. “This is a photo as I would wish myself to look all the time. Then Reprint 2O25-26 Activity 1.

Not only because I’ve never written anything before, but also because it seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old schoolgirl. Oh well, it doesn’t matter. I feel like writing, and I have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my chest. ‘Paper has more patience than people.’ I thought of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I was, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I’m not planning to let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a ‘diary’, unless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won’t make a bit of difference. Now I’m back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don’t have a friend. Let me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely alone in the world. And I’m not. I have loving parents and a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I’m with friends is having a good time. I can’t bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don’t seem to be able to get any closer, and that’s the problem. Maybe it’s my fault that we don’t confide in each other. In any case, that’s just how things are, and unfortunately they're not liable to change. This is why I’ve started the diary. To enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagination, I don’t want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, but I want the diary to be my friend, and I’m going to call this friend ‘Kitty’.

Since no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I’d better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing so. My father, the most adorable father I’ve ever seen, didn’t marry my mother until he was thirty-six and she was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born in Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12 June 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My father emigrated to Holland in 1933. My mother, Edith Hollander Frank, went with him to Holland in September, while Margot and I were sent to Aachen to stay with our grandmother. Margot went to Holland in December, and I followed in February, when I was plunked down on the table as a birthday plunked down (an present for Margot. informal word) I started right away at the Montessori nursery PUt down in a casual school. I stayed there until I was six, at which time “” I started in the first form. In the sixth form my teacher was Mrs Kuperus, the headmistress. At the end of the year we were both in tears as we said a heartbreaking farewell. In the summer of 1941 Grandma fell ill and had to have an operation, so my birthday passed with little celebration. Grandma died in January 1942. No one knows how often I think of her and still love her. This birthday celebration in 1942 was intended to make up for the other, and Grandma’s candle was lit along with the rest. The four of us are still doing well, and that brings me to the present date of 2O June 1942, and the solemn dedication of my diary. 51 ee Ou Jo Arergy oui MOL] Oral Comprehension Check 1.

Reprint 2O25-26 First Flight Saturday, 2O June 1942 Dearest Kitty, Our entire class is quaking in its boots. The reason, of course, is the forthcoming meeting in which the teachers decide who'll move up to the next form and who'll be kept back. Half the class is making bets. G.N. and I laugh ourselves silly at the two boys behind us, C.N. and Jacques, who have staked their entire holiday savings on their bet. From morning to night, it’s “You’re going to pass”, “No, ’'m not”, “Yes, you are”, “No, I’m not”. Even G.’s pleading glances and my angry outbursts can’t calm them down. If you ask me, there are so many dummies that about a quarter of the class should be kept back, but teachers are the most unpredictable creatures on earth. I'm not so worried about my girlfriends and myself. We'll make it. The only subject I’m not sure about is maths. Anyway, all we can do is wait. Until then, we keep telling each other not to lose heart. I get along pretty well with all my teachers. There are nine of them, seven men and two women. Mr Keesing, the old fogey who teaches maths, was annoyed with me for ages because I talked so much. After several warnings, he assigned me extra homework. An essay on the subject, ‘A Chatterbox’. A chatterbox — what can you write about that? I'd worry about that later, I decided. I jotted down the title in my notebook, tucked it in my bag and tried to keep quiet. That evening, after I’d finished the rest of my homework, the note about the essay caught my eye. I began thinking about the subject while chewing the tip of my fountain pen. Anyone could ramble on and leave big spaces between the words, but the trick was to come up with convincing arguments to prove the necessity of talking. I thought and thought, and suddenly I had an idea. I wrote the three pages Mr Keesing had assigned me and was satisfied. I argued that talking is a student’s trait and that I would do my best to keep it under control, Reprint 2O25-26 quaking in its boots shaking with fear and nervousness old fogey an old-fashioned person ramble on talk or write aimlessly for long convincing argument a statement made in such a manner that people believe it but that I would never be able to cure myself of the habit since my mother talked as much as I did if not more, and that there’s not much you can do about inherited traits. Mr Keesing had a good laugh at my arguments, but when I proceeded to talk my way through the next lesson, he assigned me a second essay. This time it was supposed to be on ‘An Incorrigible Chatterbox’. I handed it in, and Mr Keesing had nothing to complain about for two whole lessons. However, during the third lesson he’d finally had enough. “Anne Frank, as punishment for talking in class, write an essay entitled — ‘Quack, Quack, Quack, Said Mistress Chatterbox’.” __ inherited traits qualities (physical or mental) that one gets from one’s parents incorrigible something that cannot be corrected (usually a bad quality) The class roared. I had to laugh too, though I’d nearly exhausted my ingenuity on the topic of chatterboxes. It was time to come up with something else, something original. My friend, Sanne, who’s good at poetry, offered to help me write the essay from beginning to end in verse and I jumped for joy. Mr Keesing was trying to play a joke on me with this ridiculous subject, but I’d make sure the joke was on him. I finished my poem, and it was beautiful! It was about a mother duck and a father swan with three baby ducklings who were bitten to death by the father because they quacked too much. Luckily, Mr Keesing took the joke the right way.

Its meaning is often different from the meanings of its parts. Compare the meanings of the verbs get on and run away in (a) and (b) below. You can easily guess their meanings in (a) but in (b) they have special meanings.

The text you’ve just read has a number of phrasal verbs commonly used in English. Look up the following in a dictionary for their meanings (under the entry for the italicised word). (i) plunge (right) in (iii) ramble on (ii) kept back (iv) get along with 2. Now find the sentences in the lesson that have the phrasal verbs given below. Match them with their meanings. (You have already found out the meanings of some of them.) Are their meanings the same as that of their parts? (Note that two parts of a phrasal verb may occur separated in the text.) (i) plunge in — speak or write without focus (ii) kept back — stay indoors (iii) move up — make (them) remain quiet (iv) ramble on — have a good relationship with (v) get along with — give an assignment (homework) to a person in authority (the teacher) (vi) calm down — compensate (vii) stay in — go straight to the topic (viii) make up for — go to the next grade (ix) hand in — not promoted . Idioms Idioms are groups of words with a fixed order, and a particular meaning, different from the meanings of each of their words put together. (Phrasal verbs can also be idioms; they are said to be ‘idiomatic’ when their meaning is unpredictable.) For example, do you know what it means to ‘meet one’s match’ in English? It means to meet someone who is as good as oneself, or even better, in some skill or quality. Do you know what it means to ‘let the cat out of the bag’? Can you guess? 1. Here are a few sentences from the text which have idiomatic expressions. Can you say what each means? (You might want to consult a dictionary first.) (i) Our entire class is quaking in its boots. (ii) Until then, we keep telling each other not to lose heart. Reprint 2O25-26 \\by cw] (iii) Mr Keesing was annoyed with me for ages because II talked so much. (iv) Mr Keesing was trying to play a joke on me with this ridiculous subject, but ’d make sure the joke was on him. 2. Here are a few more idiomatic expressions that occur in the text. Try to use them in sentences of your own. (i) caught my eye (iii) laugh ourselves silly (ii) he’d had enough (iv) can’t bring myself to IV. Do you know how to use a dictionary to find out the meanings of idiomatic expressions? Take, for example, the expression caught my eye in the story. Where — under which word — would you look for it in the dictionary? Look for it under the first word. But if the first word is a ‘grammatical’ word like a, the, for, etc., then take the next word. That is, look for the first ‘meaningful’ word in the expression. In our example, it is the word caught. But you won't find caught in the dictionary, because it is the past tense of catch. You'll find caught listed under catch. So you must look under catch for the expression caught my eye. Which other expressions with catch are listed in your dictionary? Note that a dictionary entry usually first gives the meanings of the word itself, and then gives a list of idiomatic expressions using that word. For example, study this partial entry for the noun ‘eye’ from the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, 2OO5. I Eye e Noun e Part of Body 1 [C] either of the two organs on the face that you see with: The suspect has dark hair and green eyes. e Ability to See 3 [sing.] the ability to see: A surgeon needs a good eye and a steady hand. e Way of Seeing 4 [C, usually sing.] a particular way of seeing sth: He looked at the design with the eye of an engineer. e Of Needle 5 [C] the hole in the end of a needle that you put the thread through. IDM be all eyes to be watching sb/sth carefully and with a lot of interest before/in front of sb’s (very) eyes in sb’s presence; in front of sb: He had seen his life’s work destroyed before his very eyes. Be up to your eyes in sth to have a lot of sth to deal with: We’re up to our eyes in work. ee Ou Jo Arergy oui MOL] Reprint 2O25-26 First Flight Nn o& You have read the expression ‘not to lose heart’ in this text. Now find out the meanings of the following expressions using the word ‘heart’.Use each of them in a sentence of your own. break somebody’s heart close/dear to heart from the (bottom of your) heart have a heart have a heart of stone aa rR wWN your heart goes out to somebody V. Contracted Forms When we speak, we use ‘contracted forms’ or short forms such as these: can’t (for can not or cannot) Id (for Iwould or Ihad) _ she’s (for she is) Notice that contracted forms are also written with an apostrophe to show a shortening of the spelling of not, would, or is as in the above example. Writing a diary is like speaking to oneself. Plays (and often, novels) also have speech in written form. So we usually come across contracted forms in diaries, plays and novels. 1. Make a list of the contracted forms in the text. Rewrite them as full forms of two words. For example: I've = I have 2. We have seen that some contracted forms can stand for two different full forms: I'd =I had or I would Find in the text the contracted forms that stand for two different full forms, and say what these are. Speaking 4 Here is an extract adapted from a one-act play. In this extract, angry neighbours who think Joe the Inventor’s new spinning machine will make them lose their jobs come to destroy Joe’s model of the machine. You've just seen how contracted forms can make a written text sound like actual speech. Try to make this extract sound more like a real conversation by changing some of the verbs back into contracted forms. Then speak out the lines. [The door is flung open, and several men tramp in. They carry sticks, and one of them, Hos, has a hammer.] Mos : Now where is your husband, mistress? Mary : In his bed. He is sick, and weary. You would not harm him! Reprint 2O25-26 F Hos : We are going to smash his evil work to pieces. Where is the machine? Sreconp : On the table yonder. Man Hos : Then here is the end of it! [Hos smashes the model. Mary screams.] Hos : And now for your husband! Mary : Neighbours, he is a sick man and almost a cripple. You would not hurt him! Hos : He is planning to take away our daily bread... We will show him what we think of him and his ways! Mary : You have broken his machine... You have done enough... Writing Now you know what a diary is and how to keep one. Can you keep a diary for a week recording the events that occur? You may share your diary with your class, if you wish to. Use the following hints to write your diary. ¢ Though your diary is very private, write as if you are writing for someone else. e Present your thoughts in a convincing manner. ¢ Use words that convey your feelings, and words that ‘paint pictures’ for the reader. Be brief. ‘Diary language’ has some typical features such as subjectless sentences (Got up late in the morning), sentence fragments without subjects or verbs (...too bad, boring, not good), contracted forms (they're, I’ve, can’t, didn’t, etc.), and everyday expressions which people use in speech. Remember not to use such language in more formal kinds of writing.

Students do not have to think up or imagine what to write about; they only have to find words to write about what has happened. Initiate your students into the habit of keeping a diary. 2. Anne Frank’s diary became a public document after World War II. Discuss with your students diaries which became historical documents, such as Samuel Pepys’s diary. You may draw students’ attention to different types of diaries, e.g. private diary, general diary. Army officers, businessmen, doctors, executives, lawyers, motorists, police officers keep a general diary to record events that happen during the day and events that are scheduled for the day, such as appointments, meetings, things to be done, etc. 3. Passage for listening exercise: The Great Fire of London [1666] September 2nd (Lord’s Day). Jane called us up about three in the morning, to tell us of a great fire they saw in the city. So I rose and slipped on my nightgown, and went to her window, and thought it to be on the backside of Marke-Lane at the farthest; but being unused to such fire as followed, I thought it far enough off, and so went to bed again and to sleep. About seven rose again to dress myself, and then looked out of the window, and saw the fire not so much as it was and further off. By and by Jane comes and tells me that she hears that above 3OO houses have been burned down tonight by the fire we saw, and that it is now burning down all Fish Street, by London Bridge. So I made myself ready presently, and walked to the Tower, and there got up upon one of the high places, Sir J. Robinson’s little son going up with me; and there I did see the houses at that end of the bridge all on fire, and an infinite great fire on this and the other side of the bridge.

The\nreason, of course, is the forthcoming meeting in\nwhich the teachers decide who'll move up to the\nnext form and who'll be kept back. Half the class is\nmaking bets.

I jotted down the\ntitle in my notebook, tucked it in my bag and tried\nto keep quiet.\n\nThat evening, after I’d finished the rest of my\nhomework, the note about the essay caught my eye.\nI began thinking about the subject while chewing\nthe tip of my fountain pen. Anyone could ramble on\nand leave big spaces between the words, but the\ntrick was to come up with convincing arguments to\nprove the necessity of talking.

Students do not have to\nthink up or imagine what to write about; they only have to find words to write\nabout what has happened. Initiate your students into the habit of keeping a diary.\n\n2. Anne Frank’s diary became a public document after World War II. Discuss with your\nstudents diaries which became historical documents, such as Samuel Pepys’s diary.\nYou may draw students’ attention to different types of diaries, e.g. private diary,\ngeneral diary. Army officers, businessmen, doctors, executives, lawyers, motorists,\npolice officers keep a general diary to record events that happen during the day\nand events that are scheduled for the day, such as appointments, meetings, things\nto be done, etc.\n\n3. Passage for listening exercise:\n\nThe Great Fire of London [1666]\n\nSeptember 2nd (Lord’s Day). Jane called us up about three in the morning,\nto tell us of a great fire they saw in the city. So | rose and slipped on my\nnightgown, and went to her window, and thought it to be on the backside\nof Marke-Lane at the farthest; but being unused to such fire as followed,\n| thought it far enough off, and so went to bed again and to sleep.\n\nAbout seven rose again to dress myself, and then looked out of the\nwindow, and saw the fire not so much as it was and further off. By and by\nJane comes and tells me that she hears that above 300 houses have\nbeen burned down tonight by the fire we saw, and that it is now burning\ndown all Fish Street, by London Bridge.\n\nSo | made myself ready presently, and walked to the Tower, and there got\nup upon one of the high places, Sir J. Robinson’s little son going up with\nme; and there | did see the houses at that end of the bridge all on fire,\nand an infinite great fire on this and the other side of the bridge.\n\n[From The Diary of Samuel Pepys ]\n\nWhat You Can Do\n\nAfter they have completed the lesson, including the writing exercise, students can be\nasked to make a diary jotting for the previous day. Perhaps you could also write a diary\nentry describing what happened in school/class on the previous day, to share with the\nclass — try and make it amusing and interesting!

These bakers are, even today,\nknown as pader in Goa.\nDuring our childhood in Goa, the baker used to\nbe our friend, companion and guide. He used to\ncome at least twice a day. Once, when he set out in\nthe morning on his selling round, and then again,\nwhen he returned after emptying his huge basket.\nThe jingling thud of his bamboo woke us up from\nsleep and we ran to meet and greet him. Why was\nit so? Was it for the love of the loaf? Not at all. The\nloaves were bought by some Paskine or Bastine,\nthe maid-servant of the house! What we longed for\nwere those bread-bangles which we chose carefully.\nSometimes it was sweet bread of special make.\nThe baker made his musical entry on the scene\nwith the ‘jhang, jhang’ sound of his specially made\nbamboo staff. One hand supported the basket on\nhis head and the other banged the bamboo on the\nground. He would greet the lady of the house with\n“Good morning” and then place his basket on the\nvertical bamboo. We kids would be pushed aside\nwith a mild rebuke and the loaves would be delivered rebuke\nto the servant. But we would not give up. We would © expression of\nclimb a bench or the parapet and peep into the isapproval; a\nbasket, somehow. I can still recall the typical scolding\nfragrance of those loaves. Loaves for the elders and fragrance\nthe bangles for the children. Then we did not even scent\ncare to brush our teeth or wash our mouths\nproperly. And why should we? Who would take the\ntrouble of plucking the mango-leaf for the\ntoothbrush? And why was it necessary at all? The\ntiger never brushed his teeth.

Not enough can be\nsaid to show how important a baker can be for a\nvillage. The lady of the house must prepare\nsandwiches on the occasion of her daughter’s\nengagement. Cakes and bolinhas are a must for\nChristmas as well as other festivals. Thus, the\npresence of the baker’s furnace in the village is\nabsolutely essential.\n\nThe baker or bread-seller of those days had a\npeculiar dress known as the kabai. It was a single-\npiece long frock reaching down to the knees. In our\nchildhood we saw bakers wearing a shirt and\ntrousers which were shorter than full-length ones\nand longer than half pants. Even today, anyone\nwho wears a half pant which reaches just below\nthe knees invites the comment that he is dressed\nlike a pader!\n\nThe baker usually collected his bills at the end\nof the month. Monthly accounts used to be recorded\non some wall in pencil. Baking was indeed a\nprofitable profession in the old days. The baker and\nhis family never starved.

Our elders are often heard reminiscing nostalgically about those good old Portuguese days, the Portuguese and their famous loaves of bread. Those eaters of loaves might have vanished but the makers are still there. We still have amongst us the mixers, the moulders and those who bake the loaves.

These bakers are, even today, known as pader in Goa. During our childhood in Goa, the baker used to be our friend, companion and guide. He used to come at least twice a day. Once, when he set out in the morning on his selling round, and then again, when he returned after emptying his huge basket. The jingling thud of his bamboo woke us up from sleep and we ran to meet and greet him. Why was it so? Was it for the love of the loaf? Not at all. The loaves were bought by some Paskine or Bastine, the maid-servant of the house! What we longed for were those bread-bangles which we chose carefully. Sometimes it was sweet bread of special make. The baker made his musical entry on the scene with the ‘jhang, jhang’ sound of his specially made bamboo staff. One hand supported the basket on his head and the other banged the bamboo on the ground. He would greet the lady of the house with “Good morning” and then place his basket on the vertical bamboo. We kids would be pushed aside with a mild rebuke and the loaves would be delivered rebuke to the servant. But we would not give up. We would © expression of climb a bench or the parapet and peep into the isapproval; a basket, somehow. I can still recall the typical scolding fragrance of those loaves.

Hot tea could wash and clean up everything so nicely, after all! Oral Comprehension Check What are the elders in Goa nostalgic about? Is bread-making still popular in Goa? How do you know? What is the baker called? When would the baker come everyday? Why did the children run to meet him? AN Reprint 2O25-26 Marriage gifts are meaningless without the sweet bread known as the bol, just as a party or a feast loses its charm without bread. Not enough can be said to show how important a baker can be for a village. The lady of the house must prepare sandwiches on the occasion of her daughter’s engagement. Cakes and bolinhas are a must for Christmas as well as other festivals. Thus, the presence of the baker’s furnace in the village is absolutely essential. The baker or bread-seller of those days had a peculiar dress known as the kabai. It was a single- piece long frock reaching down to the knees. In our childhood we saw bakers wearing a shirt and trousers which were shorter than full-length ones and longer than half pants. Even today, anyone who wears a half pant which reaches just below the knees invites the comment that he is dressed like a pader! The baker usually collected his bills at the end of the month. Monthly accounts used to be recorded on some wall in pencil. Baking was indeed a profitable profession in the old days. The baker and his family never starved. He, his family and his servants always looked happy and prosperous. Their plump physique was an open testimony to this.

Mipway between Mysore and the coastal town of Mangalore sits a piece of heaven that must have drifted from the kingdom of god. This land of rolling hills is inhabited by a proud race of martial men, beautiful women and wild creatures. Coorg, or Kodagu, the smallest district of Karnataka, is home to evergreen rainforests, spices and coffee plantations. Evergreen rainforests cover thirty per cent of this district. During the monsoons, it pours enough to keep many visitors away. The season of joy commences from September and continues till March. The weather is perfect, with some showers thrown in for good measure. The air breathes of invigorating coffee. Coffee estates and colonial bungalows stand tucked under tree canopies in prime corners. The fiercely independent people of Coorg are possibly of Greek or Arabic descent. As one story goes, a part of Alexander’s army moved south along the coast and settled here when return became impractical. These people married amongst the locals and their culture is apparent in the martial traditions, marriage and religious rites, which are distinct from the Hindu A mainstream.

Known as kuppia, it resembles the kuffia worn by the Arabs and the Kurds. Coorgi homes have a tradition of hospitality, and they are more than willing to recount numerous tales of valour related to their sons and fathers. The Coorg Regiment is one of the most decorated in the Indian Army, and the first Chief of the Indian Army, General Cariappa, was a Coorgi. Even now, Kodavus are the only people in India permitted to carry firearms without a licence. The river, Kaveri, obtains its water from the hills and forests of Coorg. Mahaseer — a large freshwater fish — abound in these waters. Kingfishers dive for their catch, while squirrels and langurs drop partially eaten fruit for the mischief of enjoying the splash and the ripple effect in the clear water.

III Tea from Assam Pranjol, a youngster from Assam, is Rajvir’s classmate at school in Delhi. Pranjol’s father is the manager of a tea-garden in Upper > Assam and Pranjol has invited Rajvir to visit his home during the =a sumumner vacation. c= “CHar-caram... garam-chai,” a vendor called out in a high-pitched voice. 72 He came up to their window and asked, \"Chai, sa’ab?” “Give us two cups,” Pranjol said. They sipped the steaming hot liquid. Almost everyone in their compartment was drinking tea too. “Do you know that over eighty crore cups of tea are drunk every day throughout the world?” Rajvir said. “Whew!” exclaimed Pranjol. “Tea really is very popular.” The train pulled out of the station. Pranjol buried his nose in his detective book again. Rajvir too was an ardent fan of detective stories, but at the moment he was keener on looking at the beautiful scenery. It was green, green everywhere. Rajvir had never seen so much greenery before. Then the soft green paddy fields gave way to tea bushes. It was a magnificent view. Against the backdrop of densely wooded hills a sea of tea bushes stretched as far as the eye could see. Dwarfing the tiny tea plants were tall sturdy shade-trees and amidst the orderly rows of bushes busily moved doll-like figures. Reprint 2O25-26 In the distance was an ugly building with smoke billowing out of tall chimneys. “Hey, a tea garden!” Rajvir cried excitedly. Pranjol, who had been born and brought up on a plantation, didn’t share Rajvir’s excitement. “Oh, this is tea country now,” he said. “Assam has the largest concentration of plantations in the world. You will see enough gardens to last you a lifetime!” “I have been reading as much as I could about tea,” Rajvir said. “No one really knows who discovered tea but there are many legends.” “What legends?” “Well, there’s the one about the Chinese emperor who always boiled water before drinking it. One day a few leaves of the twigs burning under the pot fell into the water giving it a delicious flavour. It is said they were tea leaves.” “Tell me another!” scoffed Pranjol. “We have an Indian legend too. Bodhidharma, an ancient Buddhist ascetic, cut off his eyelids because he felt sleepy during meditations. Ten tea plants grew out of the eyelids. The leaves of these plants when put in hot water and drunk banished sleep. “Tea was first drunk in China,” Rajvir added, “as far back as 27OO B.C.! In fact words such as tea, ‘chai’ and ‘chini’ are from Chinese. Tea came to Europe only in the sixteenth century and was drunk more as medicine than as beverage.” The train clattered into Mariani junction. The boys collected their luggage and pushed their way to the crowded platform. Pranjol’s parents were waiting for them. Soon they were driving towards Dhekiabari, the tea-garden managed by Pranjol’s father. An hour later the car veered sharply off the main road. They crossed a cattle-bridge and entered Dhekiabari Tea Estate. On both sides of the gravel-road were acre upon acre of tea bushes, all neatly pruned to the same height. Groups of tea-pluckers, with bamboo baskets on their backs, wearing plastic aprons, were plucking the newly sprouted leaves.

India and tea are so intertwined together that life without the brew is unimaginable. Tea entered our life only in the mid-nineteenth century when the British started plantations in Assam and Darjeeling! In the beginning though, Indians shunned the drink as they thought it was a poison that led to umpteen diseases. Ironically, tea colonised Britain where it became a part of their social diary and also led to the establishment of numerous tea houses.

Wuat You Can Do Get your students to arrange an exhibition of photographs of different places in India — good sources are travel articles in Sunday newspapers, or in travel magazines, or in brochures available at travel agents. Ask students to bring in two or three pictures each, accompanied by a short, neatly hand-written write-up on the place shown in the pictures. Arrange them on your classroom walls.

Where are the trees in this poem, and where do they go? The trees inside are moving out into the forest, the forest that was empty all these days where no bird could sit no insect hide no sun bury its feet in shadow the forest that was empty all these nights will be full of trees by morning. All night the roots work to disengage themselves from the cracks in the veranda floor. The leaves strain toward the glass small twigs stiff with exertion long-cramped boughs shuffling under the roof like newly discharged patients half-dazed, moving to the clinic doors. I sit inside, doors open to the veranda writing long letters in which I scarcely mention the departure of the forest from the house.

The decision to acquire one, therefore, should\n\nbe made by the whole family. Without full agreement by\n\neveryone, the pet could end up unwanted. Puppies and\n\nkittens are so adorable, it is easy to understand why adults\n\nand children alike would be attracted to them. Unfortunately\n\ntheir cute looks are often a disadvantage, because people\n\npurchase them without consideration and the knowledge on\n\nhow to take proper care of them. The basic points you should\n\nkeep in mind before adopting a puppy are:\n\ne an annual dog licence in accordance with government\nregulations\n\ne its annual vaccination against major diseases\n\ne toilet training\n\ne regular grooming and bathing\n\ne obedience training\n\ne don’t forget you should feed your pet a balanced diet\n\ne socialisation (many dogs are kept confined in cages or tied\nup to stop them from dirtying the garden or from chewing\non shoes — this is wrong) is very important\n\ne a daily dose of exercise, affection and play.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nReading up on the subject beforehand is another\nimportant requirement and will guide you towards being a\nresponsible pet owner.

When his dog Jonnie died, Maxwell was too sad to think of keeping a dog again. But life without a pet was lonely... Read what happened then, in Maxwell's own words. Activity 1. Doyou have a pet? Ifyou do, you perhaps know that a petisa serious responsibility. Read in the box below what the SPCA — the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals — has to say about how to care for a pet. Owning a pet is a lifetime of commitment (up to ten years or more if you own a dog or a cat) involving considerable responsibility. The decision to acquire one, therefore, should be made by the whole family. Without full agreement by everyone, the pet could end up unwanted. Puppies and kittens are so adorable, it is easy to understand why adults and children alike would be attracted to them. Unfortunately their cute looks are often a disadvantage, because people purchase them without consideration and the knowledge on how to take proper care of them. The basic points you should keep in mind before adopting a puppy are: e an annual dog licence in accordance with government regulations e its annual vaccination against major diseases e toilet training e regular grooming and bathing e obedience training e don’t forget you should feed your pet a balanced diet e socialisation (many dogs are kept confined in cages or tied up to stop them from dirtying the garden or from chewing on shoes — this is wrong) is very important e a daily dose of exercise, affection and play. Reprint 2O25-26 Reading up on the subject beforehand is another important requirement and will guide you towards being a responsible pet owner. Selected pet shops and major book stores provide books on the care of various breeds/pets. 2. Imagine someone has gifted you a pet.

Otters are found in large numbers in the marshes (i.e. wet areas near lakes, rivers or seas) near Basra, a town in Iraq. Imagine you wanted to bring an otter from Iraq to London, as a pet. What special arrangements would you need to make for your pet otter? You would need to find a place with lots of water, for example. What other points should you think about? The information about Iraq and London given below may help you. Irae > oe London Iraq has mostly broad plains I London has a _ large and marshes along the Iranian border in the south, with large flooded areas.

There is heavy snowfall there, and when the snow melts in spring, it causes floods in central and southern Iraq. population and is a very busy city. In addition to multi- storeyed buildings, however, it has many open spaces or parks. It has a temperate climate (i.e. it is neither very hot, nor very cold), with regular but generally light rainfall or snow throughout the year.

I cabled to England, and when, three days later, cabled nothing had happened, I tried to telephone. The call sent a message by had to be booked twenty-four hours in advance.

My friend left, and I arranged to meet him in a week’s time. Five days later, my mail arrived. I carried it to my bedroom to read, and there, squatting on the floor, were two Arabs; beside them lay a sack that squirmed from time to time. They squirmed handed me a note from my friend: “Here is your otter...” twisted about Il With the opening of that sack began a phase of my _thraldom (old life that has not yet ended, and may, for all I know, fashioned) not end before I do.

He shook himself, and I half expected a cloud of dust, but in fact it was not for another month that I managed to remove the last of the mud and see the otter, as it were, in his true colours. Mijbil, as I called the otter, was, in fact, of a race previously unknown to science, and was at length christened by zoologists Lutrogale perspicillata maxwelli, or Maxwell’s otter. For the first twenty- four hours Mijbil was neither hostile nor friendly; he was simply aloof and indifferent, choosing to sleep on the floor as far from my bed as possible. The second night Mijbil came on to my bed in the small hours and remained asleep in the crook of my knees until the servant brought tea in the morning, and during the day he began to lose his apathy and take a keen, much too keen, interest in his surroundings. I made a body-belt for him and took him on a lead to the bathroom, where for half an hour he went wild with joy in the water, plunging and rolling in it, shooting up and down the length of the bathtub underwater, and making enough slosh and splash for a hippo. This, I was to learn, is a characteristic of otters; every drop of water must be, so to speak, extended and spread about the place; a bowl must at once be overturned, or, if it will not be overturned, be sat in and sploshed in until it overflows. Water must be kept on the move and made to do things; when static it is wasted and provoking. christened named hostile unfriendly aloof and indifferent keeping a distance apathy absence of interest so to speak as it were (one could say this) provoking causing anger or some other reaction Reprint 2O25-26 53 = o = a 2S = First Flight Two days later, Mijbil escaped from my bedroom as I entered it, and I turned to see his tail disappearing round the bend of the corridor that led to the bathroom. By the time I got there he was up on the end of the bathtub and fumbling at the chromium taps with his paws. I watched, amazed; in less than a minute he had turned the tap far enough to produce a trickle of water, and after a moment or two achieved the full flow. (He had been lucky to turn the tap the right way; on later occasions he would sometimes screw it up still tighter, chittering with irritation and disappointment at the tap’s failure to cooperate.) Very soon Mij would follow me without a lead and come to me when I called his name. He spent most of his time in play. He spent hours shuffling a rubber ball round the room like a four-footed soccer player using all four feet to dribble the ball, and he could also throw it, with a powerful flick of the neck, to a surprising height and distance. But the real play of an otter is when he lies on his back and juggles with small objects between his paws. Marbles were Mij’s favourite toys for this pastime: he would lie on his back rolling two or more of them up and down his wide, flat belly without ever dropping one to the floor.

Reprint 2O25-26 Ill The days passed peacefully at Basra, but I dreaded the prospect of transporting Mij to England, and to Camusfearna. The British airline to London would not fly animals, so I booked a flight to Paris on another airline, and from there to London. The airline insisted that Mij should be packed into a box not more than eighteen inches square, to be carried on the floor at my feet. I had a box made, and an hour before we started, I put Mij into the box so that he would become accustomed to it, and left for a hurried meal. When I returned, there was an appalling spectacle. There was complete silence from the box, but from its airholes and chinks around the lid, blood had trickled and dried. I whipped off the lock and tore open the lid, and Mij, exhausted and blood- spattered, whimpered and caught at my leg. He had torn the lining of the box to shreds; when I removed the last of it so that there were no cutting edges left, it was just ten minutes until the time of the flight, and the airport was five miles distant. I put the miserable Mij back into the box, holding down the lid with my hand. I sat in the back of the car with the box beside me as the driver tore through the streets of Basra like a ricochetting bullet. The aircraft was waiting to take off; I was rushed through to it by infuriated officials. Luckily, the seat booked for me was at the extreme front. I covered the floor around my feet with newspapers, rang for the air hostess, and gave her a parcel of fish (for Mij) to keep ina cool place. I took her into my confidence about the events of the last half hour. I have retained the most profound admiration for that air hostess; she was the very queen of her kind. She suggested that I might prefer to have my pet on my knee, and I could have kissed her hand in the depth of my gratitude. But, not knowing otters, I was quite unprepared for what followed.

Mij and I remained in London for nearly a month.

A suitcase that I had taken to Iraq had become damaged on the journey home, so that the lid, when closed, remained at a slope from one end to the other. Mij discovered that if he placed the ball on the high end it would run down the length of the suitcase. He would dash around to the other end to ambush ambush its arrival, hide from it, crouching, to spring up_ te attack suddenly and take it by surprise, grab it and trot off with it from a hidden to the high end once more.

I faced a continuous barrage barrage of of conjectural questions that sprayed all the conjectural Mustellines but the otter; more random guesses hit a on ‘a baby seal’ and ‘a squirrel.’ ‘Is that a walrus, questions filled with mister?’ reduced me to giggles, and outside a dog guesses show I heard ‘a hippo’. A beaver, a bear cub, a leopard — one, apparently, that had changed its spots — and a ‘brontosaur’; Mij was anything but an otter. But the question for which I awarded the highest score came from a labourer digging a hole in the street. I was still far from him when he laid down his tool, put his hands on his hips, and began to stare. As I drew nearer I saw his expression of surprise and affront, as though he would have me know that he was not one upon whom to play jokes.

She was eight years old and very\ncurious about things. Her favourite pastime was\nstanding in the front doorway of her house,\nwatching what was happening in the street outside.\nThere were no playmates of her own age on her\nstreet, and this was about all she had to do.\n\nBut for Valli, standing at the front door was every\nbit as enjoyable as any of the elaborate games other\nchildren played. Watching the street gave her many\nnew unusual experiences.\n\nWy \\\n\nOE ;\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n=\n2\ni\n2\nB\n~\ni\n3\n=\nie)\n=]\n&\n\n\nFirst Flight\n\nThe most fascinating thing of all was the bus\nthat travelled between her village and the nearest\ntown. It passed through her street each hour, once\ngoing to the town and once coming back. The sight\nof the bus, filled each time with a new set of\npassengers, was a source of unending joy for Valli.\n\nDay after day she watched the bus, and\ngradually a tiny wish crept into her head and\ngrew there: she wanted to ride on that bus, even\nif just once. This wish became stronger and\nstronger, until it was an overwhelming desire.\nValli would stare wistfully at the people who got\non or off the bus when it stopped at the street\ncorner. Their faces would kindle in her longings,\ndreams, and hopes. If one of her friends happened\nto ride the bus and tried to describe the sights of\nthe town to her, Valli would be too jealous to listen\nand would shout, in English: “Proud! proud!”\nNeither she nor her friends really understood the\nmeaning of the word, but they used it often as a\nslang expression of disapproval.\n\nOver many days and months Valli listened\ncarefully to conversations between her neighbours\nand people who regularly used the bus, and she also\nasked a few discreet questions here and there. This\nway she picked up various small details about the\nbus journey. The town was six miles from her village.\nThe fare was thirty paise one way — “which is almost\nnothing at all,” she heard one well-dressed man say,\nbut to Valli, who scarcely saw that much money\nfrom one month to the next, it seemed a fortune. The\ntrip to the town took forty-five minutes. On reaching\ntown, if she stayed in her seat and paid another\nthirty paise, she could return home on the same\nbus. This meant that she could take the one-o’clock\nafternoon bus, reach the town at one forty-five, and\nbe back home by about two forty-five...\n\nOn and on went her thoughts as she calculated\nand recalculated, planned and replanned.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nwistfully\nlongingly\n\nkindle\nset alight (a fire),\nhere, feelings\n\na slang expression\ninformal words,\noften used within a\nclose group\n\ndiscreet questions\ncareful questions\n\n\n\\l\nOral Comprehension Check as\n\n1.

How did she find out\nthese details?\n\n4. What do you think Valli was planning to do?\n\nIl\n\nWell, one fine spring day the afternoon bus was\njust on the point of leaving the village and turning\ninto the main highway when a small voice was heard\nshouting: “Stop the bus! Stop the bus!” And a tiny\nhand was raised commandingly.\n\nThe bus slowed down to a crawl, and the\nconductor, sticking his head out the door, said,\n“Hurry then! Tell whoever it is to come quickly.”\n\n“It's me,” shouted Valli. “I'm the one who has to\nget on.”\n\nBy now the bus had come to a stop, and the 97\nconductor said, “Oh, really! You don’t say so!”\n“Yes, I simply have to go to town,” said Valli,\nstill standing outside the bus, “and here’s my\nmoney.” She showed him some coins.\n“Okay, okay, but first you must get on the bus,”\nsaid the conductor, and he stretched out a hand to =\nhelp her up. -\n“Never mind,” she said, “I can get on by myself. B\nYou don’t have to help me.” =~\nThe conductor was a jolly sort, fond of joking. “Oh, -\nplease don’t be angry with me, my fine madam,” he =\nsaid. “Here, have a seat right up there in front. .\nEverybody move aside please — make way for madam.” =\n\nIt was the slack time of day, and there were slack time\nonly six or seven passengers on the bus. They were © time when there is\nall looking at Valli and laughing with the conductor. \"t much work\nValli was overcome with shyness. Avoiding\neveryone’s eyes, she walked quickly to an empty\nseat and sat down.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nFirst Flight\n\n“May we start now, madam?” the conductor\nasked, smiling. Then he blew his whistle twice, and\nthe bus moved forward with a roar.\n\nIt was a new bus, its outside painted a gleaming\nwhite with some green stripes along the sides.\nInside, the overhead bars shone like silver. Directly\nin front of Valli, above the windshield, there was a\nbeautiful clock. The seats were soft and luxurious.\n\nValli devoured everything with her eyes. But\nwhen she _ started to look outside, she found her\nview cut off by a canvas blind that covered the lower\npart of her window. So she stood up on the seat\nand peered over the blind.\n\nThe bus was now going along the bank of a canal.\nThe road was very narrow. On one side there was\nthe canal and, beyond it, palm trees, grassland,\ndistant mountains, and the blue, blue sky. On the\nother side was a deep ditch and then acres and\nacres of green fields — green, green, green, as far\nas the eye could see.\n\nOh, it was all so wonderful!\n\nSuddenly she was startled by a voice. “Listen,\nchild,” said the voice, “you shouldn't stand like that.\nSit down.”\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nSitting down, she looked to see who had spoken.\nIt was an elderly man who had honestly been\nconcerned for her, but she was annoyed by\nhis attention.\n\n“There’s nobody here who’s a child,” she said\nhaughtily. “I've paid my thirty paise like everyone\nelse.”\n\nThe conductor chimed in. “Oh, sir, but this is a\nvery grown-up madam. Do you think a mere girl\ncould pay her own fare and travel to the city\nall alone?”\n\nValli shot an angry glance at the conductor and\nsaid, “I am not a madam. Please remember that.\nAnd you've not yet given me my ticket.”\n\n“Tl remember,” the conductor said, mimicking\nher tone. Everyone laughed, and gradually Valli too\njoined in the laughter.\n\nThe conductor punched a ticket and handed it\nto her. “Just sit back and make yourself comfortable.\nWhy should you stand when you've paid for a seat?”\n\n“Because I want to,” she answered, standing\nup again.\n\n“But if you stand on the seat, you may fall and\nhurt yourself when the bus makes a sharp turn\nor hits a bump. That’s why we want you to sit\ndown, child.”\n\n“Tm not a child, I tell you,” she said irritably.\n“I'm eight years old.”\n\n“Of course, of course. How stupid of me! Eight\nyears — my!”\n\nThe bus stopped, some new passengers got on,\nand the conductor got busy for a time. Afraid of\nlosing her seat, Valli finally sat down.\n\nAn elderly woman came and sat beside her. “Are\nyou all alone, dear?” she asked Valli as the bus\nstarted again.\n\nValli found the woman absolutely repulsive — such\nbig holes she had in her ear lobes, and such ugly\nearrings in them! And she could smell the betel nut\nthe woman was chewing and see the betel juice that\nwas threatening to spill over her lips at any moment.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nhaughtily\nproudly\n\nmimicking\ncopying\n\nrepulsive\ncausing strong\ndislike\n\n99\n\nsq “ui soPry wePPl\n\n\nFirst Flight\n\n~\n9\n9\n\nUgh! — who could be sociable with such a person?\n\n“Yes, I’m travelling alone,’\n\n9\n\nshe answered curtly.\n\n“And I’ve got a ticket too.” curtly\n“Yes, she’s on her way to town,” said the showing displeasure\nconductor. “With a thirty-paise ticket.”\n“Oh, why don’t you mind your own business,”\nsaid Valli.

She had\n\nthriftily saved whatever stray coins came her way,\n\nresisting every temptation to buy peppermints, toys, thriftily\nballoons, and the like, and finally she had saved a spend money\n\ntotal of sixty paise.

Sometimes the bus\nseemed on the point of gobbling up another vehicle\nthat was coming towards them or a pedestrian\ncrossing the road. But lo! somehow it passed on\nsmoothly, leaving all obstacles safely behind. Trees\ncame running towards them but then stopped as\nthe bus reached them and simply stood there\nhelpless for a moment by the side of the road before\nrushing away in the other direction.\n\nSuddenly Valli clapped her hands with glee. A\nyoung cow, tail high in the air, was running very\nfast, right in the middle of the road, right in front\nof the bus. The bus slowed to a crawl, and the driver\nsounded his horn loudly again and again. But the\nmore he honked, the more frightened the animal\nbecame and the faster it galloped — always right in\nfront of the bus.\n\nOat\n\n101\n=\n2\nou\n2\n5\nx\n4 oa\n, ae g\n=\n®\nv=]\na\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nFirst Flight\n\n~\nio)\n1)\n\nSomehow this was very funny to Valli. She laughed\nand laughed until there were tears in her eyes.\n\n“Hey, lady, haven’t you laughed enough?” called,\nthe conductor. “Better save some for tomorrow.”\n\nAt last the cow moved off the road. And soon the\nbus came to a railroad crossing. A speck of a train\ncould be seen in the distance, growing bigger and\nbigger as it drew near. Then it rushed past the\ncrossing gate with a tremendous roar and rattle,\nshaking the bus. Then the bus went on and passed\nthe train station. From there it traversed a busy,\nwell-laid-out shopping street and, turning, entered\na wider thoroughfare. Such big, bright-looking\nshops! What glittering displays of clothes and other\nmerchandise! Such big crowds!\n\nStruck dumb with wonder, Valli gaped at everything.\n\nThen the bus stopped and everyone got off\nexcept Valli.\n\n“Hey, lady,” said the conductor, “aren’t you ready\nto get off? This is as far as your thirty paise\ntakes you.”\n\n“No,” Valli said, “I’m going back on this same\nbus.” She took another thirty paise from her pocket\nand handed the coins to the conductor.\n\n“Why, is something the matter?”\n\n“No, nothing’s the matter. I just felt like having\na bus ride, that’s all.”\n\n“Don’t you want to have a look at the sights,\nnow that you’re here?”\n\n“All by myself? Oh, ’d be much too afraid.”\n\nGreatly amused by the girl’s way of speaking,\nthe conductor said, “But you weren’t afraid to come\nin the bus.”\n\n“Nothing to be afraid of about that,” she\nanswered.\n\n“Well, then, why not go to that stall over there\nand have something to drink?

But suddenly she saw a young cow lying\ndead by the roadside, just where it had been struck\nby some fast-moving vehicle.\n\n“Isn’t that the same cow that ran in front of the\nbus on our trip to town?” she asked the conductor.\n\nThe conductor nodded, and she was overcome\nwith sadness. What had been a lovable, beautiful\ncreature just a little while ago had now suddenly\nlost its charm and its life and looked so horrible, so\nfrightening as it lay there, legs spreadeagled, a fixed\nstare in its lifeless eyes, blood all over...\n\nThe bus moved on. The memory of the dead cow\nhaunted her, dampening her enthusiasm. She no\nlonger wanted to look out the window.\n\nShe sat thus, glued to her seat, until the bus\nreached her village at three forty.

This aunt was a real\nchatterbox, never closing her mouth once she\nstarted talking.\n\n“And where have you been?” said her aunt when\nValli came in. She spoke very casually, not expecting\na reply. So Valli just smiled, and her mother and\naunt went on with their conversation.\n\n“Yes, you're right,” her mother said. “So many\nthings in our midst and in the world outside.

She was eight years old and very curious about things. Her favourite pastime was standing in the front doorway of her house, watching what was happening in the street outside. There were no playmates of her own age on her street, and this was about all she had to do. But for Valli, standing at the front door was every bit as enjoyable as any of the elaborate games other children played. Watching the street gave her many new unusual experiences. Wy \\ OE ; Reprint 2O25-26 = 2 i 2 B ~ i 3 = ie) =] & First Flight The most fascinating thing of all was the bus that travelled between her village and the nearest town. It passed through her street each hour, once going to the town and once coming back. The sight of the bus, filled each time with a new set of passengers, was a source of unending joy for Valli. Day after day she watched the bus, and gradually a tiny wish crept into her head and grew there: she wanted to ride on that bus, even if just once. This wish became stronger and stronger, until it was an overwhelming desire. Valli would stare wistfully at the people who got on or off the bus when it stopped at the street corner. Their faces would kindle in her longings, dreams, and hopes. If one of her friends happened to ride the bus and tried to describe the sights of the town to her, Valli would be too jealous to listen and would shout, in English: “Proud! proud!” Neither she nor her friends really understood the meaning of the word, but they used it often as a slang expression of disapproval. Over many days and months Valli listened carefully to conversations between her neighbours and people who regularly used the bus, and she also asked a few discreet questions here and there. This way she picked up various small details about the bus journey. The town was six miles from her village. The fare was thirty paise one way — “which is almost nothing at all,” she heard one well-dressed man say, but to Valli, who scarcely saw that much money from one month to the next, it seemed a fortune. The trip to the town took forty-five minutes. On reaching town, if she stayed in her seat and paid another thirty paise, she could return home on the same bus. This meant that she could take the one-o’clock afternoon bus, reach the town at one forty-five, and be back home by about two forty-five...

Il Well, one fine spring day the afternoon bus was just on the point of leaving the village and turning into the main highway when a small voice was heard shouting: “Stop the bus! Stop the bus!” And a tiny hand was raised commandingly. The bus slowed down to a crawl, and the conductor, sticking his head out the door, said, “Hurry then! Tell whoever it is to come quickly.” “It's me,” shouted Valli. “I'm the one who has to get on.” By now the bus had come to a stop, and the 97 conductor said, “Oh, really! You don’t say so!” “Yes, I simply have to go to town,” said Valli, still standing outside the bus, “and here’s my money.” She showed him some coins. “Okay, okay, but first you must get on the bus,” said the conductor, and he stretched out a hand to = help her up. - “Never mind,” she said, “I can get on by myself.

Avoiding everyone’s eyes, she walked quickly to an empty seat and sat down. Reprint 2O25-26 First Flight “May we start now, madam?” the conductor asked, smiling. Then he blew his whistle twice, and the bus moved forward with a roar. It was a new bus, its outside painted a gleaming white with some green stripes along the sides. Inside, the overhead bars shone like silver. Directly in front of Valli, above the windshield, there was a beautiful clock. The seats were soft and luxurious. Valli devoured everything with her eyes. But when she _ started to look outside, she found her view cut off by a canvas blind that covered the lower part of her window. So she stood up on the seat and peered over the blind. The bus was now going along the bank of a canal. The road was very narrow. On one side there was the canal and, beyond it, palm trees, grassland, distant mountains, and the blue, blue sky. On the other side was a deep ditch and then acres and acres of green fields — green, green, green, as far as the eye could see. Oh, it was all so wonderful! Suddenly she was startled by a voice. “Listen, child,” said the voice, “you shouldn't stand like that. Sit down.” Reprint 2O25-26 Sitting down, she looked to see who had spoken. It was an elderly man who had honestly been concerned for her, but she was annoyed by his attention. “There’s nobody here who’s a child,” she said haughtily. “I've paid my thirty paise like everyone else.” The conductor chimed in. “Oh, sir, but this is a very grown-up madam. Do you think a mere girl could pay her own fare and travel to the city all alone?” Valli shot an angry glance at the conductor and said, “I am not a madam. Please remember that. And you've not yet given me my ticket.” “Tl remember,” the conductor said, mimicking her tone. Everyone laughed, and gradually Valli too joined in the laughter. The conductor punched a ticket and handed it to her. “Just sit back and make yourself comfortable. Why should you stand when you've paid for a seat?” “Because I want to,” she answered, standing up again. “But if you stand on the seat, you may fall and hurt yourself when the bus makes a sharp turn or hits a bump. That’s why we want you to sit down, child.” “Tm not a child, I tell you,” she said irritably. “I'm eight years old.” “Of course, of course. How stupid of me! Eight years — my!” The bus stopped, some new passengers got on, and the conductor got busy for a time. Afraid of losing her seat, Valli finally sat down. An elderly woman came and sat beside her. “Are you all alone, dear?” she asked Valli as the bus started again. Valli found the woman absolutely repulsive — such big holes she had in her ear lobes, and such ugly earrings in them! And she could smell the betel nut the woman was chewing and see the betel juice that was threatening to spill over her lips at any moment.

But she laughed all the same, and the conductor laughed too. But the old woman went on with her drivel. “Is it proper for such a young person to travel alone? drivel Do you know exactly where you're going in town? Silly nonsense What’s the street?

Sometimes the bus seemed on the point of gobbling up another vehicle that was coming towards them or a pedestrian crossing the road. But lo! somehow it passed on smoothly, leaving all obstacles safely behind. Trees came running towards them but then stopped as the bus reached them and simply stood there helpless for a moment by the side of the road before rushing away in the other direction. Suddenly Valli clapped her hands with glee. A young cow, tail high in the air, was running very fast, right in the middle of the road, right in front of the bus. The bus slowed to a crawl, and the driver sounded his horn loudly again and again. But the more he honked, the more frightened the animal became and the faster it galloped — always right in front of the bus.

She laughed and laughed until there were tears in her eyes. “Hey, lady, haven’t you laughed enough?” called, the conductor. “Better save some for tomorrow.” At last the cow moved off the road. And soon the bus came to a railroad crossing. A speck of a train could be seen in the distance, growing bigger and bigger as it drew near. Then it rushed past the crossing gate with a tremendous roar and rattle, shaking the bus. Then the bus went on and passed the train station. From there it traversed a busy, well-laid-out shopping street and, turning, entered a wider thoroughfare. Such big, bright-looking shops! What glittering displays of clothes and other merchandise! Such big crowds! Struck dumb with wonder, Valli gaped at everything. Then the bus stopped and everyone got off except Valli. “Hey, lady,” said the conductor, “aren’t you ready to get off? This is as far as your thirty paise takes you.” “No,” Valli said, “I’m going back on this same bus.” She took another thirty paise from her pocket and handed the coins to the conductor. “Why, is something the matter?” “No, nothing’s the matter. I just felt like having a bus ride, that’s all.” “Don’t you want to have a look at the sights, now that you’re here?” “All by myself? Oh, ’d be much too afraid.” Greatly amused by the girl’s way of speaking, the conductor said, “But you weren’t afraid to come in the bus.” “Nothing to be afraid of about that,” she answered. “Well, then, why not go to that stall over there and have something to drink? Nothing to be afraid of about that either.\" “Oh, no, I couldn’t do that.” “Well, then, let me bring you a cold drink.” Reprint 2O25-26 thoroughfare a busy public road merchandise things for sale “No, I don’t have enough money.

IV “Won’t your mother be looking for you?” the conductor asked when he gave the girl her ticket. “No, no one will be looking for me,” she said. The bus started, and again there were the same wonderful sights. Valli wasn’t bored in the slightest and greeted everything with the same excitement she’d felt the first time. But suddenly she saw a young cow lying dead by the roadside, just where it had been struck by some fast-moving vehicle. “Isn’t that the same cow that ran in front of the bus on our trip to town?” she asked the conductor. The conductor nodded, and she was overcome with sadness. What had been a lovable, beautiful creature just a little while ago had now suddenly lost its charm and its life and looked so horrible, so frightening as it lay there, legs spreadeagled, a fixed stare in its lifeless eyes, blood all over... The bus moved on. The memory of the dead cow haunted her, dampening her enthusiasm. She no longer wanted to look out the window. She sat thus, glued to her seat, until the bus reached her village at three forty.

And don’t forget to bring your fare.” She laughed and jumped down from the bus. Then away she went, running straight for home. When she entered her house she found her mother awake and talking to one of Valli’s aunts, the one from South Street. This aunt was a real chatterbox, never closing her mouth once she started talking. “And where have you been?” said her aunt when Valli came in. She spoke very casually, not expecting a reply. So Valli just smiled, and her mother and aunt went on with their conversation. “Yes, you're right,” her mother said. “So many things in our midst and in the world outside. How can we possibly know about everything? And even when we do know about something, we often can’t understand it completely, can we?” “Oh, yes!” breathed Valli. “What?” asked her mother. “What’s that you say?” “Oh,” said Valli, “I was just agreeing with what you said about things happening without our knowledge.” “Just a chit of a girl, she is,” said her aunt, “and yet look how she pokes her nose into our conversation, just as though she were a grown lady.” Valli smiled to herself.

The students should be given two or three days to collect old (used) tickets from their friends, relatives and acquaintances: they could be bus tickets, train tickets, plane tickets, cinema tickets, tickets to cultural events, etc. By the time they finish the lesson they should be able to get a good collection in place. Get them to make a collage using as many as possible of the tickets collected, on a sheet of poster paper. This can then form the basis for many interesting activities: classification according to type of tickets (for what?) or price (how much?), etc; the most desirable tickets, the tickets no one wants, etc. — let students think of more ways to classify them. Get students to write a paragraph with the collage as base, and their imagination as guide. 2. You can also ask the students do the following. (i) In the story Valli has to save money and make plans to be able to ride the bus. In pairs, discuss how you spent your pocket money last month. Did you spend it on yourself, or on someone dear to you? (ii) Valli's enthusiasm is dampened and the memory of the dead cow haunts her. In groups, discuss an incident which may have troubled or discouraged you. Reprint 2O25-26 The Tale of Custard the Dragon This poem is written in the style of a ballad — a song or poem that tells a story. You must be familiar with ballads that narrate tales of courage or heroism. This poem is a humorous ballad close to a parody. Read it aloud, paying attention to the rhythm. Belinda lived in a little white house, With a little black kitten and a little grey mouse, And a little yellow dog and a little red wagon, And a realio, trulio, little pet dragon. Now the name of the little black kitten was Ink, And the little grey mouse, she called him Blink, And the little yellow dog was sharp as Mustard, But the dragon was a coward, and she called him Custard. Custard the dragon had big sharp teeth, And spikes on top of him and scales underneath, Mouth like a fireplace, chimney for a nose, And realio, trulio daggers on his toes. Belinda was as brave as a barrel full of bears, And Ink and Blink chased lions down the stairs, Mustard was as brave as a tiger in a rage, But Custard cried for a nice safe cage. Reprint 2O25-26 First Flight ~ fo} oe) Belinda tickled him, she tickled him unmerciful, Ink, Blink and Mustard, they rudely called him Percival, They all sat laughing in the little red wagon At the realio, trulio, cowardly dragon. Belinda giggled till she shook the house, And Blink said Weeck! which is giggling for a mouse, Ink and Mustard rudely asked his age, When Custard cried for a nice safe cage. Suddenly, suddenly they heard a nasty sound, And Mustard growled, and they all looked around. Meowch! cried Ink, and ooh! cried Belinda, For there was a pirate, climbing in the winda. Pistol in his left hand, pistol in his right, And he held in his teeth a cutlass bright, His beard was black, one leg was wood; It was clear that the pirate meant no good. Belinda paled, and she cried Help! Help! But Mustard fled with a terrified yelp, Ink trickled down to the bottom of the household, And little mouse Blink strategically mouseholed. But up jumped Custard, snorting like an engine, Clashed his tail like irons in a dungeon, With a clatter and a clank and a jangling squirm, He went at the pirate like a robin at a worm. The pirate gaped at Belinda’s dragon, And gulped some grog from his pocket flagon, He fired two bullets, but they didn’t hit, And Custard gobbled him, every bit. Reprint 2O25-26 Belinda embraced him, Mustard licked him, No one mourned for his pirate victim. Ink and Blink in glee did gyrate Around the dragon that ate the pirate. But presently up spoke little dog Mustard, I'd have been twice as brave if I hadn’t been flustered. And up spoke Ink and up spoke Blink, We'd have been three times as brave, we think, And Custard said, I quite agree That everybody is braver than me. Belinda still lives in her little white house, With her little black kitten and her little grey mouse, And her little yellow dog and her little red wagon, And her realio, trulio little pet dragon. Belinda is as brave as a barrel full of bears, And Ink and Blink chase lions down the stairs, Mustard is as brave as a tiger in a rage, But Custard keeps crying for a nice safe cage. OGDEN Nasu Ogden Nash wrote over four hundred pieces of comic verse. The best of his work was published in 14 volumes between 1931 and 1972. His work is perhaps best described in this poetic tribute by _ Anthony Burgess: ...he brought a new kind of sound to our literary diversions. And didn’t care much about breaking the poetic laws of the Medes and the Persians. He uses lines, sometimes of considerable length that are colloquial and prosy. And at the end presents you with a rhyme... This bringing together of the informal and the formal is what his genius chiefly loves. I am trying to imitate him here, but he is probably quite inimitable.

Who are the characters in this poem? List them with their pet names. Why did Custard cry for a nice safe cage? Why is the dragon called “cowardly dragon”? “Belinda tickled him, she tickled him unmerciful...” Why? The poet has employed many poetic devices in the poem. For example: “Clashed his tail like iron in a dungeon” — the poetic device here is a simile. Can you, with your partner, list some more such poetic devices used in the poem? Read stanza three again to know how the poet describes the appearance of the dragon. Can you find out the rhyme scheme of two or three stanzas of the poem? Writers use words to give us a picture or image without actually saying what they mean. Can you trace some images used in the poem? Do you find The Tale of Custard the Dragon to be a serious or a light-hearted poem? Give reasons to support your answer. This poem, in ballad form, tells a story.

Stop the bus!” And a tiny\nhand was raised commandingly.\n\nThe bus slowed down to a crawl, and the\nconductor, sticking his head out the door, said,\n“Hurry then! Tell whoever it is to come quickly.”\n\n“It's me,” shouted Valli. “I'm the one who has to\nget on.”\n\nBy now the bus had come to a stop, and the 97\nconductor said, “Oh, really! You don’t say so!”\n“Yes, I simply have to go to town,” said Valli,\nstill standing outside the bus, “and here’s my\nmoney.” She showed him some coins.\n“Okay, okay, but first you must get on the bus,”\nsaid the conductor, and he stretched out a hand to =\nhelp her up. -\n“Never mind,” she said, “I can get on by myself. B\nYou don’t have to help me.” =~\nThe conductor was a jolly sort, fond of joking. “Oh, -\nplease don’t be angry with me, my fine madam,” he =\nsaid. “Here, have a seat right up there in front. .\nEverybody move aside please — make way for madam.” =\n\nIt was the slack time of day, and there were slack time\nonly six or seven passengers on the bus. They were © time when there is\nall looking at Valli and laughing with the conductor. \"t much work\nValli was overcome with shyness. Avoiding\neveryone’s eyes, she walked quickly to an empty\nseat and sat down.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

Then he blew his whistle twice, and\nthe bus moved forward with a roar.\n\nIt was a new bus, its outside painted a gleaming\nwhite with some green stripes along the sides.\nInside, the overhead bars shone like silver. Directly\nin front of Valli, above the windshield, there was a\nbeautiful clock. The seats were soft and luxurious.\n\nValli devoured everything with her eyes. But\nwhen she _ started to look outside, she found her\nview cut off by a canvas blind that covered the lower\npart of her window. So she stood up on the seat\nand peered over the blind.\n\nThe bus was now going along the bank of a canal.\nThe road was very narrow. On one side there was\nthe canal and, beyond it, palm trees, grassland,\ndistant mountains, and the blue, blue sky. On the\nother side was a deep ditch and then acres and\nacres of green fields — green, green, green, as far\nas the eye could see.\n\nOh, it was all so wonderful!\n\nSuddenly she was startled by a voice. “Listen,\nchild,” said the voice, “you shouldn't stand like that.\nSit down.”\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

At twelve, he was sent away for schooling in\nthe Hindu sacred scriptures and four years later he\nreturned home to marry a princess. They had a son\nand lived for ten years as befitted royalty. At about\nthe age of twenty-five, the Prince, heretofore shielded\nfrom the sufferings of the world, while out hunting\nchanced upon a sick man, then an aged man, then\na funeral procession, and finally a monk begging\nfor alms. These sights so moved him that he at\nonce went out into the world to seek enlightenment\nconcerning the sorrows he had witnessed.\nHe wandered for seven years and finally sat\ndown under a peepal tree, where he vowed to stay\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nchanced upon\ncame across by\nchance\n\nenlightenment\na state of high\nspiritual knowledge\n\n\nFirst Flight\n\n~\n~\ni)\n\nuntil enlightenment came. Enlightened after seven\ndays, he renamed the tree the Bodhi Tree (Tree of\nWisdom) and began to teach and to share his new\nunderstandings. At that point he became known as\nthe Buddha (the Awakened or the Enlightened). The\nBuddha preached his first sermon at the city of\nBenares, most holy of the dipping places on the River\nGanges; that sermon has been preserved and is given\nhere. It reflects the Buddha’s wisdom about one\ninscrutable kind of suffering.\n\nKisa Gotami had an only son, and he died. In her grief\nshe carried the dead child to all her neighbours, asking\nthem for medicine, and the people said, “She has lost\nher senses. The boy is dead.”\n\nAt length, Kisa Gotami met a man who replied to her\nrequest, “I cannot give thee medicine for thy child, but I\nknow a physician who can.”\n\nAnd the girl said, “Pray tell me, sir; who is it?” And\nthe man replied, \"Go to Sakyamuni, the Buddha.”\n\nKisa Gotami repaired to the Buddha and cried, “Lord\nand Master, give me the medicine that will cure my boy.”\n\nThe Buddha answered, “I want a handful of mustard-\nseed.” And when the girl in her joy promised to procure\nit, the Buddha added, “The mustard-seed must be taken\nfrom a house where no one has lost a child, husband,\nparent or friend.”\n\nPoor Kisa Gotami now went from house to house,\nand the people pitied her and said, “Here is mustard-\nseed; take it!” But when she asked, “Did a son or\ndaughter, a father or mother, die in your family?” they\nanswered her, “Alas! the living are few, but the dead are\nmany. Do not remind us of our deepest grief.” And there\nwas no house but some beloved one had died in it.\n\nKisa Gotami became weary and hopeless, and sat\ndown at the wayside watching the lights of the city, as\nthey flickered up and were extinguished again. At last\nthe darkness of the night reigned everywhere. And she\nconsidered the fate of men, that their lives flicker up\nand are extinguished again. And she thought to herself,\n“How selfish am I in my grief! Death is common to all;\nyet in this valley of desolation there is a path that leads\nhim to immortality who has surrendered all selfishness.”\n\nThe Buddha said, “The life of mortals in this world\nis troubled and brief and combined with pain.

As ripe fruits are early\n\nin danger of falling, so mortals when born are always in\n\ndanger of death. As all earthen vessels made by the\n\npotter end in being broken, so is the life of mortals.

This is the most common, and it is not necessarily manifested\nby crying.\n\ne Anger. This is one of the most confusing feelings for a survivor. There\nmay be frustration at not being able to prevent the death, and a sense\nof not being able to exist without the loved one.\n\ne Guilt and Self-reproach.

An individual may fear that she/he won't be able to care for\nherself/himself.\n\ne Loneliness. There are reminders throughout the day that a partner,\nfamily member or friend is gone. For example, meals are no longer\nprepared the same way, phone calls to share a special moment don’t\nhappen.\n\ne Fatigue. There is an overall sense of feeling tired.\n\ne Disbelief.

Reprint 2O25-26 Glossary ramparts: the high, wide walls around a castle or fort, for example, the ramparts of the Red Fort Thinking about the Poem 4 1. What does the young man mean by “great honey-coloured /Ramparts at your ear?” Why does he say that young men are “thrown into despair” by them? What colour is the young woman’s hair? What does she say she can change it to? Why would she want to do so? Objects have qualities which make them desirable to others. Can you think of some objects (a car, a phone, a dress...) and say what qualities make one object more desirable than another? Imagine you were trying to sell an object: what qualities would you emphasise? What about people? Do we love others because we like their qualities, whether physical or mental? Or is it possible to love someone “for themselves alone”? Are some people ‘more lovable’ than others? Discuss this question in pairs or in groups, considering points like the following. (i) a parent or caregiver’s love for a newborn baby, for a mentally or physically challenged child, for a clever child or a prodigy (ii) the public’s love for a film star, a sportsperson, a politician, or a social worker (iii) your love for a friend, or brother or sister (iv) your love for a pet, and the pet’s love for you. You have perhaps concluded that people are not objects to be valued for their qualities or riches rather than for themselves. But elsewhere Yeats asks the question: How can we separate the dancer from the dance? Is it possible to separate ‘the person himself or herself from how the person looks, sounds, walks, and so on? Think of how you or a friend or member of your family has changed over the years. Has your relationship also changed? In what way? Reprint 2O25-26 119 a ° 5 =] =) o a 5 o ico} ° 5 Ss,",

Enlightened after seven\ndays, he renamed the tree the Bodhi Tree (Tree of\nWisdom) and began to teach and to share his new\nunderstandings. At that point he became known as\nthe Buddha (the Awakened or the Enlightened). The\nBuddha preached his first sermon at the city of\nBenares, most holy of the dipping places on the River\nGanges; that sermon has been preserved and is given\nhere. It reflects the Buddha’s wisdom about one\ninscrutable kind of suffering.\n\nKisa Gotami had an only son, and he died. In her grief\nshe carried the dead child to all her neighbours, asking\nthem for medicine, and the people said, “She has lost\nher senses. The boy is dead.”\n\nAt length, Kisa Gotami met a man who replied to her\nrequest, “I cannot give thee medicine for thy child, but I\nknow a physician who can.”\n\nAnd the girl said, “Pray tell me, sir; who is it?” And\nthe man replied, \"Go to Sakyamuni, the Buddha.”\n\nKisa Gotami repaired to the Buddha and cried, “Lord\nand Master, give me the medicine that will cure my boy.”\n\nThe Buddha answered, “I want a handful of mustard-\nseed.” And when the girl in her joy promised to procure\nit, the Buddha added, “The mustard-seed must be taken\nfrom a house where no one has lost a child, husband,\nparent or friend.”\n\nPoor Kisa Gotami now went from house to house,\nand the people pitied her and said, “Here is mustard-\nseed; take it!” But when she asked, “Did a son or\ndaughter, a father or mother, die in your family?” they\nanswered her, “Alas! the living are few, but the dead are\nmany. Do not remind us of our deepest grief.” And there\nwas no house but some beloved one had died in it.\n\nKisa Gotami became weary and hopeless, and sat\ndown at the wayside watching the lights of the city, as\nthey flickered up and were extinguished again. At last\nthe darkness of the night reigned everywhere. And she\nconsidered the fate of men, that their lives flicker up\nand are extinguished again. And she thought to herself,\n“How selfish am I in my grief! Death is common to all;\nyet in this valley of desolation there is a path that leads\nhim to immortality who has surrendered all selfishness.”\n\nThe Buddha said, “The life of mortals in this world\nis troubled and brief and combined with pain.

          "text": "Feelings of Grief\n\nAlthough grief is unique and personal, a broad range of feelings and\n\nbehaviours are commonly experienced after the death of a loved one.\n\ne Sadness. This is the most common, and it is not necessarily manifested\nby crying.\n\ne Anger. This is one of the most confusing feelings for a survivor. There\nmay be frustration at not being able to prevent the death, and a sense\nof not being able to exist without the loved one.\n\ne Guilt and Self-reproach. People may believe that they were not kind\nenough or caring enough to the person who died, or that the person\nshould have seen the doctor sooner.\n\ne Anxiety. An individual may fear that she/he won't be able to care for\nherself/himself.\n\ne Loneliness. There are reminders throughout the day that a partner,\nfamily member or friend is gone. For example, meals are no longer\nprepared the same way, phone calls to share a special moment don’t\nhappen.\n\ne Fatigue. There is an overall sense of feeling tired.\n\ne Disbelief. This occurs particularly if it was a sudden death.\n\nHelping Others Who Are Experiencing Grief\n\nWhen a friend, loved one, or co-worker is experiencing grief—how can we\nhelp? It helps to understand that grief is expressed through a variety of\nbehaviours.\n\nReach out to others in their grief, but understand that some may not\nwant to accept help and will not share their grief. Others will want to\ntalk about their thoughts and feelings or reminisce.\n\nBe patient and let the grieving person know that you care and are\nthere to support him or her.\n\nII..Good Grief\nAmirali ETZIONI\n\nSoon after my wife died — her car slid off an icy road in 1985 — a school\npsychologist warned me that my children and I were not mourning in the\nright way. We felt angry; the proper first stage, he said, is denial.\n\nIn late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his\nsleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child.\n\nThere is no set form for grief, and no ‘right’ way to express it. There\nseems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress\nsystematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are\ntold, to jump to anger — or to wallow too long in this stage before moving\ntowards acceptance.\n\n=\n=\no\nMN\nic)\net\nB\n°\n=)\n2\nEo\nem\nic)\n=}\n2\nLt\nOo\na\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

The planning only includes arranging for\nrings, brides’ dress, cars, and a reception. Earlier, the bride’s\nfamily paid for the reception, but now-a-days brides’ and\ngrooms’ families usually share expenses. A Russian wedding\nlasts for two days; some weddings last as long as a week,\nand the occasion becomes something to remember for years.\nThe necessary part of the wedding ceremony is a wedding\nprocession of several cars. The best friends of the groom/\nbride meet before the wedding a few times, make posters,\nwrite speeches and organise contests. When the groom\narrives to fetch the bride for the registration, he has to fight\nto get her! Russians usually live in apartments in tall\nbuildings, and the groom has to climb several stairs to reach\nhis bride. But at each landing he must answer a question\nto be allowed to go up. The bride’s friends ask difficult\nquestions (sometimes about the bride, sometimes just\ndifficult riddles), and the groom must answer with the help\nof his friends. For example, he may be shown a few photos\nof baby girls and he must say which one his bride is. If he\nguesses wrong, he must pay cash to move ahead. After the\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nmarriage registration, the newly-married couple leaves the\nguests for a tour of the city sights. After two or three hours\nof the city tour the couple arrives at the reception. The couple\nsits at a specially arranged table with their family, friends\nand invited guests. The reception starts with toasts to the\ncouple. A wedding toast is a custom where a close friend or\nrelative of the groom or the bride says a few words to wish\nthe couple, then everyone raises their glass of wine, and\ndrink it up at the same moment. The groom is then asked to\nkiss the bride. After a few toasts, people start eating and\ndrinking, and generally have fun. After some time, the bride\ngets ‘stolen’! She disappears, and when the groom starts\nlooking for her, he is asked to pay a fee. Usually it is his\nfriends who ‘steal’ the bride. Then there are the bride’s\nfriends — they steal the bride’s shoe. The groom must pay\nmoney for the shoe too. The guests enjoy watching these\ntussles, and continue partying.\n\n2.

It was written in 1888-89.\n\nThe play is about the tendency of wealthy families to seek ties\nwith other wealthy families, to increase their estates by encouraging\nmarriages that make good economic sense. Ivan Lomov, a long time\nwealthy neighbour of Stepan Chubukov, also wealthy, comes to\nseek the hand of Chubukov’s twenty-five-year-old daughter, Natalya.\nAll three are quarrelsome people, and they quarrel over petty issues.\nThe proposal is in danger of being forgotten amidst all this\nquarrelling.

Reported Speech\n\nA sentence in reported speech consists of two parts: a reporting clause,\nwhich contains the reporting verb, and the reported clause. Look at the\nfollowing sentences.\n\n(a) “I went to visit my grandma last week,” said Mamta.\n(b) Mamta said that she had gone to visit her grandma the previous week.\n\nIn sentence (a), we have Mamta’s exact words. This is an example of direct\nspeech. In sentence (b), someone is reporting what Mamta said. This is\ncalled indirect speech or reported speech. A sentence in reported speech\nis made up of two parts — a reporting clause and a reported clause.\n\nIn sentence (b), Mamta said is the reporting clause containing the reporting\nverb said. The other clause — that she had gone to visit her grandma last\nweek — is the reported clause.\n\nNotice that in sentence (b) we put the reporting clause first. This is done to\nshow that we are not speaking directly, but reporting someone else’s words.\nThe tense of the verb also changes; past tense (went) becomes past perfect\n(had gone).\n\nHere are some pairs of sentences in direct and reported speech. Read them\ncarefully, and do the task that follows:\n\n1. (i) Lomov : Honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, do you think I may count\n\non her consent? (Direct Speech)\n\n(ii) Lomov asked Stepan Stepanovitch respectfully if he thought he might\ncount on her consent. (Reported Speech)\n\n2. (i) Lomov : Im getting a noise in my ears from excitement. (Direct\nSpeech)\n(ii) Lomov said that he was getting a noise in his ears from excitement.\n(Reported Speech)\n\n3. (i) Natatya  : Why haven’t you been here for such a long time? (Direct\nSpeech)\n(ii) Natalya Stepanovna asked why he hadn’t been there for such a long\ntime. (Reported Speech)\n\n4. (i) Cuusuxov : What’s the matter? (Direct Speech)\n(ii) Chubukov asked him what the matter was. (Reported Speech)\n5. (i) Natatya : My mowers will be there this very day! (Direct Speech)\ni)\n\nNatalya Stepanovna declared that her mowers would be there that\nvery day. (Reported Speech)\n\nYou must have noticed that when we report someone’s exact words, we\nhave to make some changes in the sentence structure. In the following\nsentences fill in the blanks to list the changes that have occurred in\nthe above pairs of sentences. One has been done for you.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nIll.\n\n1.

Can you guess what sort of proposal the play is about? fi) asuggestion, plan or scheme for doing something (ii) an offer for a possible plan or action (iii) the act of asking someone's hand in marriage A Russian Wedding Do you know anything about a Russian marriage ceremony? Read this article about a Russian wedding. Preparations fora Russian Wedding: A Russian wedding is very simple. The planning only includes arranging for rings, brides’ dress, cars, and a reception. Earlier, the bride’s family paid for the reception, but now-a-days brides’ and grooms’ families usually share expenses. A Russian wedding lasts for two days; some weddings last as long as a week, and the occasion becomes something to remember for years. The necessary part of the wedding ceremony is a wedding procession of several cars. The best friends of the groom/ bride meet before the wedding a few times, make posters, write speeches and organise contests. When the groom arrives to fetch the bride for the registration, he has to fight to get her! Russians usually live in apartments in tall buildings, and the groom has to climb several stairs to reach his bride. But at each landing he must answer a question to be allowed to go up. The bride’s friends ask difficult questions (sometimes about the bride, sometimes just difficult riddles), and the groom must answer with the help of his friends. For example, he may be shown a few photos of baby girls and he must say which one his bride is. If he guesses wrong, he must pay cash to move ahead. After the Reprint 2O25-26 marriage registration, the newly-married couple leaves the guests for a tour of the city sights. After two or three hours of the city tour the couple arrives at the reception. The couple sits at a specially arranged table with their family, friends and invited guests. The reception starts with toasts to the couple. A wedding toast is a custom where a close friend or relative of the groom or the bride says a few words to wish the couple, then everyone raises their glass of wine, and drink it up at the same moment. The groom is then asked to kiss the bride. After a few toasts, people start eating and drinking, and generally have fun. After some time, the bride gets ‘stolen’! She disappears, and when the groom starts looking for her, he is asked to pay a fee. Usually it is his friends who ‘steal’ the bride. Then there are the bride’s friends — they steal the bride’s shoe. The groom must pay money for the shoe too. The guests enjoy watching these tussles, and continue partying. 2. Do you think Indian and Russian weddings have any customs in common?

Wedding Ceremonies in Russia and India Customs similar to Customs different from Indian ones Indian ones “The Proposal” (originally titled “A Marriage Proposal’) is a one- act play, a farce, by the Russian short story writer and dramatist Anton Chekhov. It was written in 1888-89. The play is about the tendency of wealthy families to seek ties with other wealthy families, to increase their estates by encouraging marriages that make good economic sense. Ivan Lomov, a long time wealthy neighbour of Stepan Chubukov, also wealthy, comes to seek the hand of Chubukov’s twenty-five-year-old daughter, Natalya. All three are quarrelsome people, and they quarrel over petty issues. The proposal is in danger of being forgotten amidst all this quarrelling. But economic good sense ensures that the proposal is made, after all — although the quarrelling perhaps continues!

I assure you that his lower jaw is shorter than the upper. Have you measured? : Yes. He’s all right at following, of course, but if you want to get hold of anything... In the first place, our Squeezer is a thoroughbred animal, the son of Harness and Chisels while there’s no getting at the pedigree of your dog at all. He’s old and as ugly as a worn-out cab-horse. He is old, but I wouldn’t take five Squeezers for him. Why, how can you? Guess is a dog; as for Squeezer, well, it’s too funny to argue.

Reported Speech A sentence in reported speech consists of two parts: a reporting clause, which contains the reporting verb, and the reported clause. Look at the following sentences. (a) “I went to visit my grandma last week,” said Mamta. (b) Mamta said that she had gone to visit her grandma the previous week. In sentence (a), we have Mamta’s exact words. This is an example of direct speech. In sentence (b), someone is reporting what Mamta said. This is called indirect speech or reported speech. A sentence in reported speech is made up of two parts — a reporting clause and a reported clause. In sentence (b), Mamta said is the reporting clause containing the reporting verb said. The other clause — that she had gone to visit her grandma last week — is the reported clause. Notice that in sentence (b) we put the reporting clause first. This is done to show that we are not speaking directly, but reporting someone else’s words. The tense of the verb also changes; past tense (went) becomes past perfect (had gone). Here are some pairs of sentences in direct and reported speech. Read them carefully, and do the task that follows: 1. (i) Lomov : Honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, do you think I may count on her consent? (Direct Speech) (ii) Lomov asked Stepan Stepanovitch respectfully if he thought he might count on her consent. (Reported Speech) 2. (i) Lomov : Im getting a noise in my ears from excitement. (Direct Speech) (ii) Lomov said that he was getting a noise in his ears from excitement. (Reported Speech) 3. (i) Natatya : Why haven’t you been here for such a long time? (Direct Speech) (ii) Natalya Stepanovna asked why he hadn’t been there for such a long time. (Reported Speech) 4. (i) Cuusuxov : What’s the matter? (Direct Speech) (ii) Chubukov asked him what the matter was. (Reported Speech) 5. (i) Natatya : My mowers will be there this very day! (Direct Speech) i) Natalya Stepanovna declared that her mowers would be there that very day. (Reported Speech) You must have noticed that when we report someone’s exact words, we have to make some changes in the sentence structure. In the following sentences fill in the blanks to list the changes that have occurred in the above pairs of sentences. One has been done for you. Reprint 2O25-26 Ill. 1. To report a question, we use the reporting verb —__asked __ (as in Sentence Set 1). 2. To report a statement, we use the reporting verb 3. The adverb of place here changes to 4. When the verb in direct speech is in the present tense, the verb in reported speech is in the tense (as in Sentence Set 3). 5. If the verb in direct speech is in the present continuous tense, the verb in reported speech changes to tense. For example, changes to was getting. 6. When the sentence in direct speech contains a word denoting respect, we add the adverb in the reporting clause (as in Sentence Set 1). 7. The pronouns J, me, our and mine, which are used in the first person in direct speech, change according to the subject or object of the reporting verb such as ; ; or in reported speech. Here is an excerpt from an article from the Times of India. dated 27 August 2OO6. Rewrite it, changing the sentences in direct speech into reported speech. Leave the other sentences unchanged. “Why do you want to know my age? If people know I am so old, I won't get work!” laughs 9O-year-old A. K. Hangal, one of Hindi cinema’s most famous character actors. For his age, he is rather energetic. “What’s the secret?” we ask. “My intake of everything is in small quantities. And I walk a lot,” he replies. “I joined the industry when people retire. I was in my 4Os. So I don’t miss being called a star. I am still respected and given work, when actors of my age are living in poverty and without work. I don’t have any complaints,” he says, adding, “but yes, I have always been underpaid.” Recipient of the Padma Bhushan, Hangal never hankered after money or materialistic gains. “No doubt I am content today, but money is important. I was a fool not to understand the value of money earlier,” he regrets. Speaking and Writing 1. Anger Management: As adults, one important thing to learn is how to manage our temper.

I was startled. “Who did you say had sent for me?” I asked the messenger. “The Rani Mother”. “The Bara Rani?” “No, sir, the Chota Rani Mother.” The Chota Rani! It seemed a century since I had been sent for by her. I kept them all waiting there, and went off into the inner apartments. When I stepped into our room I had another shock of surprise to find Bimala there with a distinct suggestion of being dressed up. The room, which from persistent neglect, had latterly acquired an air of having grown absent-minded, had regained something of its old order this afternoon. I stood there silently, looking enquiringly at Bimala. She flushed a little and the fingers of her right hand toyed for a time with the bangles on her left arm. Then she abruptly broke the silence. “Look here! Is it right that ours should be the only market in all Bengal which allows foreign goods?” “What, then, would be the right thing to do?” I asked. “Order them to be cleared out!” “But the goods are not mine.” “Is not the market yours?” “It is much more theirs who use it for trade.” “Let them trade in Indian goods, then.” “Nothing would please me better. But suppose they do not?” “Nonsense! How dare they be so insolent? Are you not...” “I am very busy this afternoon and cannot stop to argue it out. But I must refuse to tyrannise.” “It would not be tyranny for selfish gain, but for the sake of the country.” “To tyrannise for the country is to tyrannise over the country. But that I am afraid you will never understand.” With this I came away. In groups, discuss the qualities one should look for in a marriage partner.

Students should then guess the name of the playwright. (1564 —1616). He was born at Stratford-on-Avon in April 1564. His father was an important public figure in Stratford. People believe that he received a decent grammar-school education in literature, logic, and Latin (mathematics and natural science did not form part of the curriculum). When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, who was eight years his senior. He seems to have prospered in the London theatre world. He probably began his career as an actor in London, and he earned enough as author to acquire landed property. When he was forty-seven, he retired to a large house in Stratford. He died in 1616, leaving behind a body of work that still stands as a pinnacle in world literature. 139 —- — Homophones — ~...

Reported Speech\n\nA sentence in reported speech consists of two parts: a reporting clause,\nwhich contains the reporting verb, and the reported clause. Look at the\nfollowing sentences.\n\n(a) “I went to visit my grandma last week,” said Mamta.\n(b) Mamta said that she had gone to visit her grandma the previous week.\n\nIn sentence (a), we have Mamta’s exact words. This is an example of direct\nspeech. In sentence (b), someone is reporting what Mamta said. This is\ncalled indirect speech or reported speech. A sentence in reported speech\nis made up of two parts — a reporting clause and a reported clause.\n\nIn sentence (b), Mamta said is the reporting clause containing the reporting\nverb said. The other clause — that she had gone to visit her grandma last\nweek — is the reported clause.\n\nNotice that in sentence (b) we put the reporting clause first. This is done to\nshow that we are not speaking directly, but reporting someone else’s words.\nThe tense of the verb also changes; past tense (went) becomes past perfect\n(had gone).\n\nHere are some pairs of sentences in direct and reported speech. Read them\ncarefully, and do the task that follows:\n\n1. (i) Lomov : Honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, do you think I may count\n\non her consent? (Direct Speech)\n\n(ii) Lomov asked Stepan Stepanovitch respectfully if he thought he might\ncount on her consent. (Reported Speech)\n\n2. (i) Lomov : Im getting a noise in my ears from excitement. (Direct\nSpeech)\n(ii) Lomov said that he was getting a noise in his ears from excitement.\n(Reported Speech)\n\n3. (i) Natatya  : Why haven’t you been here for such a long time? (Direct\nSpeech)\n(ii) Natalya Stepanovna asked why he hadn’t been there for such a long\ntime. (Reported Speech)\n\n4. (i) Cuusuxov : What’s the matter? (Direct Speech)\n(ii) Chubukov asked him what the matter was. (Reported Speech)\n5. (i) Natatya : My mowers will be there this very day! (Direct Speech)\ni)\n\nNatalya Stepanovna declared that her mowers would be there that\nvery day.

I was startled.\n\n“Who did you say had sent for me?” I asked the messenger.\n\n“The Rani Mother”.\n\n“The Bara Rani?”\n\n“No, sir, the Chota Rani Mother.”\n\nThe Chota Rani! It seemed a century since I had been sent for by her.\nI kept them all waiting there, and went off into the inner apartments.\nWhen I stepped into our room I had another shock of surprise to find\nBimala there with a distinct suggestion of being dressed up. The room,\nwhich from persistent neglect, had latterly acquired an air of having\ngrown absent-minded, had regained something of its old order this\nafternoon. I stood there silently, looking enquiringly at Bimala.\n\nShe flushed a little and the fingers of her right hand toyed for a time\nwith the bangles on her left arm. Then she abruptly broke the silence.\n“Look here! Is it right that ours should be the only market in all Bengal\nwhich allows foreign goods?”\n\n“What, then, would be the right thing to do?” I asked.\n\n“Order them to be cleared out!”\n\n“But the goods are not mine.”\n\n“Is not the market yours?”\n\n“It is much more theirs who use it for trade.”\n\n“Let them trade in Indian goods, then.”\n\n“Nothing would please me better. But suppose they do not?”\n\n“Nonsense! How dare they be so insolent? Are you not...”\n\n“I am very busy this afternoon and cannot stop to argue it out. But I\nmust refuse to tyrannise.”\n\n“It would not be tyranny for selfish gain, but for the sake of the\ncountry.”\n\n“To tyrannise for the country is to tyrannise over the country.

This principle marks a\ndeparture from the legacy of bookish learning which\ncontinues to shape our system and causes a gap between\nthe school, home and community. The syllabi and\ntextbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt\nto implement this basic idea. They also attempt to\ndiscourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these\nmeasures will take us significantly further in the direction\nof a child-centered system of education outlined in the\nNational Policy of Education (1986).\n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that\nschool principals and teachers will take to encourage\nchildren to reflect on their own learning and to pursue\nimaginative activities and questions. We must recognise\nthat, given space, time and freedom, children generate new\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to\nthem by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the\nsole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why\nother resources and sites of learning are ignored.\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive\nand treat children as participants in learning, not as\nreceivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\n\nThese aims imply considerable change in school\nroutines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily\ntime-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the\nannual calendar so that the required number of teaching\ndays are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used\nfor teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective\nthis textbook proves for making children’s life at school a\nhappy experience, rather than a source of stress or\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the\nproblem of curricular burden by restructuring and\nreorienting knowledge at different stages with greater\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nconsideration for child psychology and the time available\nfor teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this\nendeavour by giving higher priority and space to\nopportunities for contemplation and wondering,\ndiscussion in small groups, and activities requiring\nhands-on experience.\n\nThe National Council of Educational Research and\nTraining (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the\ntextbook development committee responsible for this book.\nWe wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group\nin languages, Professor Namwar Singh, and the Chief\nAdvisor for this book, Professor R. Amritavalli, for guiding\nthe work of this committee. Several teachers contributed\nto the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their\nprincipals for making this possible. We are indebted to the\ninstitutions and organisations which have generously\npermitted us to draw upon their resources, materials and\npersonnel. We are especially grateful to the members of\nthe National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the\nDepartment of Secondary and Higher Education,\nMinistry of Human Resource Development under the\nChairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and\nProfessor G.P.

The English curriculum lays emphasis on\nproviding a variety of rich, comprehensible inputs to\nlearners to enable their engagement in learning; and\non recognising the multilinguality of everyday\nexperience in India. This textbook aims at helping the\nlearner to read for meaning in context, thus providing\na bank of language to serve as a base for\ncommunication in English.\n\ne This book presents you with texts in a variety of\ngenres, including the diary, the formal address, the\ntravelogue, and the play, on literary, cultural and\nsociological themes that touch upon aspects of life\nrelevant to adolescents. Questions and ideas about\nthe individual and society, the understanding and\nmanagement of one’s emotions, and of one’s place\nin a larger time and space, are here presented both\nby such voices from contemporary history as Nelson\nMandela and Anne Frank, and in fiction from India\nand abroad, chosen for their enduring value. There\nare units that present glimpses of our country, and\ndepict our relationship with the natural world.\n\ne The units in the book have been loosely structured\nin the following way. An introductory section, Before\nYou Read, gives information or activates knowledge\nabout the text to be read, and suggests some warm-\nup activities. Let children participate in these to the\nfullest extent; where necessary or possible, add some\nactivities of your own.\n\ne An innovation made in consultation with teachers is a\nwhile-reading activity, the Oral Comprehension Check,\nwhich aims at a quick, ongoing check that learners are\nindeed following the text up to that point, so that they\ncan progress meaningfully to the parts of the text that\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nfollow. Let learners briefly share their understanding by\norally answering the questions in this section.\n\nReflection, expression of individual opinion and deeper\nunderstanding of the text can occur later, when the text\nhas been read and understood in its totality, in the section\nThinking about the Text. The questions in the latter\nsection are designed to enable the learner to move from\nfactual understanding to critical thinking.\n\nThinking about Language provides exercises or tasks\nthat follow naturally from the contexts suggested by a\nparticular unit, for enrichment of vocabulary and other\nlanguage skills. Exploit them well and also create your\nown activities. Exercises for the communicative skills of\nlistening, speaking, and writing have been given in\ncontexts that support group or pair activity. A variety of\nwriting tasks have been aimed at.\n\nWhile dealing with poems, let children understand and\nenjoy the theme and the language by reading a poem with\nclose attention, more than once, silently or along with the\nteacher or a partner. Where some information has been\nprovided about the poet or the background to the poem,\nthis should not stand in the way of the learner accessing\nthe poem directly, and attempting to make sense of it.\nHow do we read poetry? Here is what one teacher says.\n\nAll poetry requires patience. Be patient with the text;\nread carefully for nuance and inference. Know what the\nwords mean. Look up words that are unfamiliar — look\nup words that are familiar but you cannot specify. Pay\nattention to words or phrases that resonate with other\nthings you know and try to identify the connection. Be\npatient and read slowly, and you will be amply rewarded.\n\nEach unit includes some guidelines for your assistance,\nunder the head In This Lesson, organised under two\nsubsections — What We Have Done, and What You Can\nDo. The first subsection summarises the theme of the unit,\nand/or its activities. The second suggests interesting\npossibilities for you to go beyond the text, using the text as\na springboard for a variety of language activities appropriate\nto your particular group of learners. Suggested here, for\nexample, are group activities for speaking or making a ticket\ncollage, as well as dictation. As you follow these suggestions\nand take these activities forward along your own lines, you\nwill be able to enrich your students’ learning.\n\nvi\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nTextbook Development Committee\n\nCHAIRPERSON, ADVISORY GROUP IN LANGUAGES\nProfessor Namwar Singh, formerly Chairman, School of\nLanguages, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi\nCuter ADVISOR\n\nR.

Srinivasan Bijnan Sutar Jahan Lal Amitabh Kumar Vijayam Sankaranarayanan Sunil Sharma Cover, Layout and Illustrations Nidhi Wadhwa Reprint 2O25-26 Loreword THe National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2OO5, recommends that children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centered system of education outlined in the National Policy of Education (1986). The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater Reprint 2O25-26 consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in languages, Professor Namwar Singh, and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor R. Amritavalli, for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, materials and personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande for their valuable time and contribution. As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinements.

The National Education Policy 2O2O, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise. Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following: ¢ Content based on genres of literature in the textbooks and supplementary readers at different stages of school education ¢ Content that is meant for achieving Learning Outcomes for developing language proficiency and is accessible at different stages e For reducing the curriculum load and examination stress in view of the previling condition of the Pandemic e Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning e Content, which is irrelevant in the present context This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above.

          "text": "Loreword\n\nTHe National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005,\nrecommends that children’s life at school must be linked\nto their life outside the school. This principle marks a\ndeparture from the legacy of bookish learning which\ncontinues to shape our system and causes a gap between\nthe school, home and community. The syllabi and\ntextbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt\nto implement this basic idea. They also attempt to\ndiscourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these\nmeasures will take us significantly further in the direction\nof a child-centered system of education outlined in the\nNational Policy of Education (1986).\n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that\nschool principals and teachers will take to encourage\nchildren to reflect on their own learning and to pursue\nimaginative activities and questions. We must recognise\nthat, given space, time and freedom, children generate new\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to\nthem by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the\nsole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why\nother resources and sites of learning are ignored.\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive\nand treat children as participants in learning, not as\nreceivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\n\nThese aims imply considerable change in school\nroutines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily\ntime-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the\nannual calendar so that the required number of teaching\ndays are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used\nfor teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective\nthis textbook proves for making children’s life at school a\nhappy experience, rather than a source of stress or\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the\nproblem of curricular burden by restructuring and\nreorienting knowledge at different stages with greater\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

The English curriculum lays emphasis on\nproviding a variety of rich, comprehensible inputs to\nlearners to enable their engagement in learning; and\non recognising the multilinguality of everyday\nexperience in India. This textbook aims at helping the\nlearner to read for meaning in context, thus providing\na bank of language to serve as a base for\ncommunication in English.\n\ne This book presents you with texts in a variety of\ngenres, including the diary, the formal address, the\ntravelogue, and the play, on literary, cultural and\nsociological themes that touch upon aspects of life\nrelevant to adolescents. Questions and ideas about\nthe individual and society, the understanding and\nmanagement of one’s emotions, and of one’s place\nin a larger time and space, are here presented both\nby such voices from contemporary history as Nelson\nMandela and Anne Frank, and in fiction from India\nand abroad, chosen for their enduring value. There\nare units that present glimpses of our country, and\ndepict our relationship with the natural world.\n\ne The units in the book have been loosely structured\nin the following way. An introductory section, Before\nYou Read, gives information or activates knowledge\nabout the text to be read, and suggests some warm-\nup activities. Let children participate in these to the\nfullest extent; where necessary or possible, add some\nactivities of your own.\n\ne An innovation made in consultation with teachers is a\nwhile-reading activity, the Oral Comprehension Check,\nwhich aims at a quick, ongoing check that learners are\nindeed following the text up to that point, so that they\ncan progress meaningfully to the parts of the text that\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

Let learners briefly share their understanding by\norally answering the questions in this section.\n\nReflection, expression of individual opinion and deeper\nunderstanding of the text can occur later, when the text\nhas been read and understood in its totality, in the section\nThinking about the Text. The questions in the latter\nsection are designed to enable the learner to move from\nfactual understanding to critical thinking.\n\nThinking about Language provides exercises or tasks\nthat follow naturally from the contexts suggested by a\nparticular unit, for enrichment of vocabulary and other\nlanguage skills. Exploit them well and also create your\nown activities. Exercises for the communicative skills of\nlistening, speaking, and writing have been given in\ncontexts that support group or pair activity. A variety of\nwriting tasks have been aimed at.\n\nWhile dealing with poems, let children understand and\nenjoy the theme and the language by reading a poem with\nclose attention, more than once, silently or along with the\nteacher or a partner. Where some information has been\nprovided about the poet or the background to the poem,\nthis should not stand in the way of the learner accessing\nthe poem directly, and attempting to make sense of it.\nHow do we read poetry? Here is what one teacher says.\n\nAll poetry requires patience. Be patient with the text;\nread carefully for nuance and inference. Know what the\nwords mean. Look up words that are unfamiliar — look\nup words that are familiar but you cannot specify. Pay\nattention to words or phrases that resonate with other\nthings you know and try to identify the connection. Be\npatient and read slowly, and you will be amply rewarded.\n\nEach unit includes some guidelines for your assistance,\nunder the head In This Lesson, organised under two\nsubsections — What We Have Done, and What You Can\nDo. The first subsection summarises the theme of the unit,\nand/or its activities. The second suggests interesting\npossibilities for you to go beyond the text, using the text as\na springboard for a variety of language activities appropriate\nto your particular group of learners. Suggested here, for\nexample, are group activities for speaking or making a ticket\ncollage, as well as dictation. As you follow these suggestions\nand take these activities forward along your own lines, you\nwill be able to enrich your students’ learning.\n\nvi\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",
