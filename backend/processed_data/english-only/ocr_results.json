The only thing the earth needed was a\ndownpour or at least a shower. Throughout the\nmorning Lencho — who knew his fields intimately\n— had done nothing else but see the sky towards\nthe north-east.\n\n“Now we're really going to get some water, woman.”\n\nThe woman who was preparing supper, replied,\n“Yes, God willing”. The older boys were working in\nthe field, while the smaller ones were playing near\nthe house until the woman called to them all, “Come\nfor dinner”.

In the north-east huge mountains of clouds\ncould be seen approaching. The air was fresh and\nsweet. The man went out for no other reason than\nto have the pleasure of feeling the rain on his body,\nand when he returned he exclaimed, “These aren’t\nraindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins.\nThe big drops are ten cent pieces and the little ones\nare fives.”\n\nWith a satisfied expression he regarded the field\n\nof ripe corn with its flowers, draped in a curtain of draped\n\nrain. But suddenly a strong wind began to blow\nand along with the rain very large hailstones began\nto fall. These truly did resemble new silver coins.\nThe boys, exposing themselves to the rain, ran out\nto collect the frozen pearls.\n\n“It’s really getting bad now,” exclaimed the man.\n“I hope it passes quickly.” It did not pass quickly.\nFor an hour the hail rained on the house, the\ngarden, the hillside, the cornfield, on the whole\nvalley. The field was white, as if covered with salt.\n\nNot a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was\ntotally destroyed. The flowers were gone from the\nplants. Lencho’s soul was filled with sadness. When\nthe storm had passed, he stood in the middle of the\nfield and said to his sons, “A plague of locusts would\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\ncovered (with cloth)\n\nlocusts\n\ninsects which fly in\nbig swarms (groups)\nand destroy crops\n\n\n\nhave left more than this.

What did Lencho hope for?\n\n2. Why did Lencho say the raindrops were like ‘new coins’?\n\n3. How did the rain change? What happened to Lencho’s fields?\n4. What were Lencho’s feelings when the hail stopped?\n\nBut in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary\nhouse in the middle of the valley, there was a single\nhope: help from God.\n“Don’t be so upset, even though this seems like\na total loss. Remember, no one dies of hunger.”\n“That’s what they say: no one dies of hunger.”\nAll through the night, Lencho thought only of\nhis one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he\nhad been instructed, see everything, even what is\ndeep in one’s conscience. Lencho was an ox of a conscience\nman, working like an animal in the fields, but stil] 9 inner sense of\nhe knew how to write. The following Sunday, at \"9htand wrong\ndaybreak, he began to write a letter which he\nhimself would carry to town and place in the mail.\nIt was nothing less than a letter to God.\n“God,” he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family\nand I will go hungry this year.

I wish I\nhad the faith of the man who wrote this letter.\nStarting up a correspondence with God!”\n\nSo, in order not to shake the writer’s faith in God,\nthe postmaster came up with an idea: answer the\nletter. But when he opened it, it was evident that to\nanswer it he needed something more than goodwill,\nink and paper. But he stuck to his resolution: he\nasked for money from his employees, he himself gave\npart of his salary, and several friends of his were\nobliged to give something ‘for an act of charity’.\n\nIt was impossible for him to gather together the\nhundred pesos, so he was able to send the farmer\nonly a little more than half. He put the money in an\nenvelope addressed to Lencho and with it a letter\ncontaining only a single word as a signature: God.\n\nOral Comprehension Check\n\n1. Who or what did Lencho have faith in? What did he do?\n\n2. Whoread the letter?\n3. What did the postmaster do then?\n\nThe following Sunday Lencho came a bit earlier\nthan usual to ask if there was a letter for him.\nIt was the postman himself who handed the letter\nto him while the postmaster, experiencing the\ncontentment of a man who has_ performed a good\ndeed, looked on from his office.\n\nLencho showed not the slightest surprise on\nseeing the money; such was his confidence — but\nhe became angry when he counted the money. God\ncould not have made a mistake, nor could he have\ndenied Lencho what he had requested.\n\nImmediately, Lencho went up to the window to\nask for paper and ink. On the public writing-table,\nhe started to write, with much wrinkling of his brow,\ncaused by the effort he had to make to express his\nideas. When he finished, he went to the window to\nbuy a stamp which he licked and then affixed to\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\ncontentment\nsatisfaction\n\n\nthe envelope with a blow of his fist. The moment\nthe letter fell into the mailbox the postmaster went\nto open it. It said: “God: Of the money that I asked\nfor, only seventy pesos reached me. Send me the\nrest, since I need it very much. But don’t send it to\nme through the mail because the post office\nemployees are a bunch of crooks. Lencho.”\n\nOral Comprehension Check\n1. Was Lencho surprised to find a letter for him with money in it?\n2. What made him angry?\n\nThinking about the Text\n\n1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell\nyou this?\n\n2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the\nletter ‘God’?\n\n3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why/Why not?\n\n4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony\nin the situation? (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected\naspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or amusing because it is the\nopposite of what is expected.)\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n7\n>\n=\na\na\nLe 3\nSo\na\n=)\net\n\n\n6.\n\nAre there people like Lencho in the real world?

You may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.\n\ngreedy naive stupid ungrateful\nselfish comical unquestioning\n\nThere are two kinds of conflict in the story: between humans and nature,\nand between humans themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?\n\nThinking about —\n\nI.\n\nFirst Flight\n\noo\n\n—\n—\n\nLook at the following sentence from the story.\n\nSuddenly a strong wind began to blow and along with the rain very large\nhailstones began to fall.\n‘Hailstones’ are small balls of ice that fall like rain. A storm in which\nhailstones fall is a ‘hailstorm’. You know that a storm is bad weather with\nstrong winds, rain, thunder and lightning.\n\nThere are different names in different parts of the world for storms,\ndepending on their nature. Can you match the names in the box with\ntheir descriptions below, and fill in the blanks? You may use a dictionary\nto help you.\n\ngale, whirlwind, cyclone,\nhurricane, tornado, typhoon\n\n1.

A violent storm with very strong winds, especially in the western Atlantic\nOcean: r\n\n6. A very strong wind that moves very fast in a spinning movement and\ncauses a lot of damage: 1\n\n. Notice how the word ‘hope’ is used in these sentences from the story:\n\n(a) I hope it (the hailstorm) passes quickly.\n(b) There was a single hope: help from God.\n\nIn the first example, ‘hope’ is a verb which means you wish for something to\nhappen. In the second example it is a noun meaning a chance for something\nto happen.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nMatch the sentences in Column A with the meanings of ‘hope’ in Column B.\nA B\n\n[ a) : ‘-\nWill you get the subjects you want a feeling that something good will\nto study in college? probably happen\nI hope so. thinking that this would happen\nI hope you don’t mind my saying (It may or may not have happened.)\nthis, but I don’t like the way you stopped believing that this good\nare arguing. thing would happen\nThis discovery will give new hope wanting something to happen\nto HIV/AIDS sufferers.

Relative Clauses\nLook at these sentences\n\n(a) All morning Lencho — who knew his fields intimately — looked at\nthe sky.\n(b) The woman, who was preparing supper, replied, “Yes, God willing.”\nThe italicised parts of the sentences give us more information about Lencho\nand the woman. We call them relative clauses. Notice that they begin with\n\na relative pronoun who. Other common relative pronouns are whom, whose,\nand which.\n\nThe relative clauses in (a) and (b) above are called non-defining, because\nwe already know the identity of the person they describe. Lencho is a\nparticular person, and there is a particular woman he speaks to. We don’t\nneed the information in the relative clause to pick these people out from a\nlarger set.\n\n9\n>\n=\na\na\nLe 3\nSo\na\n=)\net\n\nA non-defining relative clause usually has a comma in front of it and a\ncomma after it (some writers use a dash (—) instead, as in the story). If the\nrelative clause comes at the end, we just put a full stop.\n\nJoin the sentences given below using who, whom, whose, which, as\nsuggested.\n1. I often go to Mumbai. Mumbai is the commercial capital of India. (which)\n\n2. My mother is going to host a TV show on cooking. She cooks very\nwell. (who)\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nFirst Flight\n\n~\n9S\n\n3. These sportspersons are going to meet the President. Their performance\nhas been excellent. (whose)\n\n4. Lencho prayed to God. His eyes see into our minds. (whose)\n5. This man cheated me. I trusted him. (whom)\nSometimes the relative pronoun in a relative clause remains ‘hidden’. For\nexample, look at the first sentence of the story:\n(a) The house — the only one in the entire valley — sat on the crest of a\nlow hill.\nWe can rewrite this sentence as:\n\n(b) The house — which was the only one in the entire valley — sat on\nthe crest of a low hill.\n\nIn (a), the relative pronoun which and the verb was are not present.\n\n. Using Negatives for Emphasis\n\nWe know that sentences with words such as no, not or nothing show the\nabsence of something, or contradict something. For example:\n\n(a) This year we will have no corn. (Corn will be absent)\n(b) The hail has left nothing. (Absence of a crop)\n\n(c) These aren’t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins.\n(Contradicts the common idea of what the drops of water falling from\nthe sky are)\n\nBut sometims negative words are used just to emphasise an idea. Look at\nthese sentences from the story:\n\n(d) Lencho...had done nothing else but see the sky towards the north-\neast. (He had done only this)\n\n(e) The man went out for no other reason than to have the pleasure of\nfeeling the rain on his body. (He had only this reason)\n\n(f) Lencho showed not the slightest surprise on seeing the money.\n(He showed no surprise at all)\n\nNow look back at example (c). Notice that the contradiction in fact serves to\nemphasise the value or usefulness of the rain to the farmer.\n\nFind sentences in the story with negative words, which express the\nfollowing ideas emphatically.\n\n1. The trees lost all their leaves.\n\n2. The letter was addressed to God himself.\n\n3. The postman saw this address for the first time in his career.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nV. Metaphors\n\nThe word metaphor comes from a Greek word meaning ‘transfer’. Metaphors\n\ncompare two things or ideas: a quality or feature of one thing is transferred\n\nto another thing. Some common metaphors are\n\ne the leg of the table: The leg supports our body. So the object that supports\na table is described as a leg.\n\n¢ the heart of the city: The heart is an important organ in the centre of our\nbody. So this word is used to describe the central area of a city.\n\nIn pairs, find metaphors from the story to complete the table below. Try\nto say what qualities are being compared. One has been done for you.\n\n_ Object = Metaphor Quality or Feature Compared\n\nCloud\n\nHuge mountains The mass or ‘hugeness’\nof clouds of mountains\n\nRaindrops\n\nHailstones\n\n- aS\nAn ox of a man\n\ni\n\nF Speaking\nHave you ever been in great difficulty, and felt that only a miracle could\nhelp you?

Ask a few students to volunteer to actually send a money order (the\namount need not be large) and share the experience with the rest of the class.\n\nReading: Break the text up into manageable chunks for reading (three paragraphs, for\nexample), and encourage students to read silently, on their own. Give them enough\ntime to read, and then discuss what they have read before going on to the next portion.\nUse the ‘Oral Comprehension Checks’ in the appropriate places, and use the ‘Thinking\nabout the Text’ questions at the end of the passage to help them go beyond the text.\nGrammar: After they have done the exercise, ask students to make their own sentences\nwith non-defining relative clauses — for example, ‘Meena, who's a very clever girl, is\nalways first in class.’ Or, ‘Our gardener, who knows a lot about plants, loves to talk\nabout them.’\n\nSpeaking: Take the first turn — talk to the students about an instance from your own\nlife, or from that of someone you know.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n=\nic)\n=\n=\nic}\niat\n=\n°\na\n=)\noe\n\n\nDust of Snow\n\nThe way a crow\nShook down on me\nThe dust of snow\nFrom a hemlock tree\n\nHas given my heart\nA change of mood\nAnd saved some part\nOf a day I had rued.\n\nROBERT FROST\n\nP Glossa ry\n\nhemlock: A poisonous plant (tree) with small white flowers\n\nrued: held in regret\n\nThinking about the Poem 4\n\nThis poem presents a moment that seems simple, but has a larger significance.\n[Compare this other quotation from Robert Frost: “Always, always a larger\nsignificance...

It was not only\na display of pinpoint precision and military force,\nbut a demonstration of the military’s loyalty to\ndemocracy, to a new government that had been\nfreely and fairly elected. Only moments before, the\nhighest generals of the South African defence force\nand police, their chests bedecked with ribbons and\nmedals from days gone by, saluted me and pledged\ntheir loyalty. I was not unmindful of the fact that\nnot so many years before they would not have\nsaluted but arrested me. Finally a chevron of Impala\njets left a smoke trail of the black, red, green, blue\nand gold of the new South African flag.\n\nThe day was symbolised for me by the playing of\nour two national anthems, and the vision of whites\nsinging ‘Nkosi Sikelel —iAfrika’ and blacks singing\n‘Die Stem’, the old anthem of the Republic. Although\nthat day neither group knew the lyrics of the anthem\nthey once despised, they would soon know the\nwords by heart.\n\nOn the day of the inauguration, I was\noverwhelmed with a sense of history. In the first\ndecade of the twentieth century, a few years after\nthe bitter Anglo-Boer war and before my own birth,\nthe white-skinned peoples of South Africa patched\nup their differences and erected a system of racial\ndomination against the dark-skinned peoples of their\nown land.

I felt that day, as I have on so\nmany other days, that I was simply the sum of all\nthose African patriots who had gone before me. That\nlong and noble line ended and now began again\nwith me. I was pained that I was not able to thank\nthem and that they were not able to see what their\nsacrifices had wrought.\n\nThe policy of apartheid created a deep and lasting\nwound in my country and my people.

But\nin a country like South Africa, it was almost\nimpossible for a man of my birth and colour to fulfil\nboth of those obligations. In South Africa, a man of\ncolour who attempted to live as a human being was\npunished and isolated. In South Africa, a man who\ntried to fulfil his duty to his people was inevitably\nripped from his family and his home and was forced\nto live a life apart, a twilight existence of secrecy\nand rebellion. I did not in the beginning choose to\nplace my people above my family, but in attempting\nto serve my people, I found that I was prevented\nfrom fulfilling my obligations as a son, a brother, a\nfather and a husband.\n\nI was not born with a hunger to be free. I was born\nfree — free in every way that I could know. Free to\nrun in the fields near my mother’s hut, free to swim\nin the clear stream that ran through my village, free\nto roast mealies under the stars and ride the broad\nbacks of slow-moving bulls. As long as I obeyed my\nfather and abided by the customs of my tribe, I was\nnot troubled by the laws of man or God.\n\nIt was only when I began to learn that my boyhood\nfreedom was an illusion, when I discovered as a\nyoung man that my freedom had already been taken\nfrom me, that I began to hunger for it. At first, as a\nstudent, I wanted freedom only for myself, the\ntransitory freedoms of being able to stay out at night,\nread what I pleased and go where I chose. Later, as\na young man in Johannesburg, I yearned for the\nbasic and honourable freedoms of achieving my\npotential, of earning my keep, of marrying and\nhaving a family — the freedom not to be obstructed\nin a lawful life.\n\nBut then I slowly saw that not only was I not\nfree, but my brothers and sisters were not free. I\nsaw that it was not just my freedom that was\ncurtailed, but the freedom of everyone who looked\nlike I did.

Who helps\n\nhim?\n\nI\nHis First Flight\n\nTHE young seagull was alone on his ledge. His two\nbrothers and his sister had already flown away the\nday before. He had been afraid to fly with them.\nSomehow when he had taken a little run forward to\nthe brink of the ledge and attempted to flap his\nwings he became afraid. The great expanse of sea\nstretched down beneath, and it was such a long\nway down — miles down.

I was happy to be\nalone high up above the sleeping countryside. I was\nflying my old Dakota aeroplane over France back to\nEngland. I was dreaming of my holiday and looking\nforward to being with my family. I looked at my\nwatch: one thirty in the morning.\n\n‘T should call Paris Control soon,’ I thought. As I\nlooked down past the nose of the aeroplane, I saw\nthe lights of a big city in front of me. I switched on\nthe radio and said, “Paris Control, Dakota DS 088\nhere. Can you hear me? I’m on my way to England.\nOver.”\n\nThe voice from the radio answered me immediately:\n“DS 088, I can hear you. You ought to turn twelve\ndegrees west now, DS 088. Over.”\n\nI checked the map and the compass, switched\nover to my second and last fuel tank, and turned\nthe Dakota twelve degrees west towards England.\n\nTll be in time for breakfast,’ I thought. A good\nbig English breakfast! Everything was going well —\nit was an easy flight.\n\nParis was about 150 kilometres behind me when\nI saw the clouds. Storm clouds. They were huge.\nThey looked like black mountains standing in front\nof me across the sky. I knew I could not fly up and\nover them, and I did not have enough fuel to fly\naround them to the north or south.\n\n“I ought to go back to Paris,” I thought, but I\nwanted to get home. I wanted that breakfast.\n\nTll take the risk,’ I thought, and flew that old\nDakota straight into the storm.\n\nInside the clouds, everything was suddenly black.\nIt was impossible to see anything outside the\naeroplane. The old aeroplane jumped and twisted\nin the air. I looked at the compass.

The\nother instruments were suddenly dead, too. I tried\nthe radio.\n\n“Paris Control? Paris Control? Can you hear me?”\n\nThere was no answer. The radio was dead too. I\nhad no radio, no compass, and I could not see where\nI was. I was lost in the storm. Then, in the black\nclouds quite near me, I saw another aeroplane. It\nhad no lights on its wings, but I could see it flying\nnext to me through the storm. I could see the pilot’s\nface — turned towards me. I was very glad to see\nanother person. He lifted one hand and waved.\n\n“Follow me,” he was saying. “Follow me.”\n\n‘He knows that I am lost,’ I thought. ‘He’s trying\nto help me.’\n\nHe turned his aeroplane slowly to the north, in\nfront of my Dakota, so that it would be easier for\nme to follow him. I was very happy to go behind the\nstrange aeroplane like an obedient child.\n\nAfter half an hour the strange black aeroplane\nwas still there in front of me in the clouds. Now\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nthere was only enough fuel in the old Dakota’s last\ntank to fly for five or ten minutes more. I was\nstarting to feel frightened again. But then he started\nto go down and I followed through the storm.\n\nSuddenly I came out of the clouds and saw two\nlong straight lines of lights in front of me. It was a\nrunway! An airport! I was safe! I turned to look for\nmy friend in the black aeroplane, but the sky was\nempty. There was nothing there. The black\naeroplane was gone. I could not see it anywhere.\n\nI landed and was not sorry to walk away from the\nold Dakota near the control tower. I went and asked\na woman in the control centre where I was and who\nthe other pilot was. I wanted to say ‘Thank you’.\n\nShe looked at me very strangely, and then\nlaughed.\n\n“Another aeroplane? Up there in this storm? No\nother aeroplanes were flying tonight. Yours was the\nonly one I could see on the radar.”\n\nSo who helped me to arrive there safely without\na compass or a radio, and without any more fuel in\nmy tanks?

As persecutions\n_Anne Frank, 10 October 1942. against the Jewish population\nincreased, the family went into\nhiding in July 1942 in hidden rooms in her father Otto Frank’s\noffice building. After two years in hiding, the group was betrayed\nand transported to the concentration camp system where Anne died\nof typhus in Bergen-Belsen within days of her sister, Margot Frank.\nHer father, Otto, the only survivor of the group, returned to Amsterdam\nafter the war ended, to find that her diary had been saved. Convinced\nthat it was a unique record, he took action to have it published in\nEnglish under the name The Diary of a Young Girl.\nThe diary was given to Anne Frank for her thirteenth birthday\nand chronicles the events of her life from 12 June 1942 until its\nJinal entry of 1 August 1944. It was eventually translated from its\noriginal Dutch into many languages and became one of the world’s\nmost widely read books. There have also been several films,\ntelevision and theatrical productions, and even an opera, based on\nthe diary. Described as the work of a mature and insightful mind,\nthe diary provides an intimate examination of daily life under Nazi\noccupation. Anne Frank has become one of the most renowned and\ndiscussed of the Holocaust victims.\n\n“This is a photo as I would wish\nmyself to look all the time. Then\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nActivity\n\n1.

The\nreason, of course, is the forthcoming meeting in\nwhich the teachers decide who'll move up to the\nnext form and who'll be kept back. Half the class is\nmaking bets. G.N. and I laugh ourselves silly at the\ntwo boys behind us, C.N. and Jacques, who have\nstaked their entire holiday savings on their bet.\nFrom morning to night, it’s “You’re going to pass”,\n“No, ’'m not”, “Yes, you are”, “No, I’m not”. Even G.’s\npleading glances and my angry outbursts can’t calm\nthem down. If you ask me, there are so many\ndummies that about a quarter of the class should\nbe kept back, but teachers are the most\nunpredictable creatures on earth.\n\nI'm not so worried about my girlfriends and\nmyself. We'll make it. The only subject I’m not sure\nabout is maths. Anyway, all we can do is wait. Until\nthen, we keep telling each other not to lose heart.\n\nI get along pretty well with all my teachers. There\nare nine of them, seven men and two women. Mr\nKeesing, the old fogey who teaches maths, was\nannoyed with me for ages because I talked so much.\nAfter several warnings, he assigned me extra\nhomework. An essay on the subject, ‘A Chatterbox’.\nA chatterbox — what can you write about that? I'd\nworry about that later, I decided. I jotted down the\ntitle in my notebook, tucked it in my bag and tried\nto keep quiet.\n\nThat evening, after I’d finished the rest of my\nhomework, the note about the essay caught my eye.\nI began thinking about the subject while chewing\nthe tip of my fountain pen. Anyone could ramble on\nand leave big spaces between the words, but the\ntrick was to come up with convincing arguments to\nprove the necessity of talking. I thought and\nthought, and suddenly I had an idea. I wrote the\nthree pages Mr Keesing had assigned me and was\nsatisfied. I argued that talking is a student’s trait\nand that I would do my best to keep it under control,\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nquaking in its boots\nshaking with fear\nand nervousness\n\nold fogey\nan old-fashioned\nperson\n\nramble on\ntalk or write\naimlessly for long\n\nconvincing\nargument\n\na statement made in\nsuch a manner that\npeople believe it\n\n\nbut that I would never be able to cure myself of the\nhabit since my mother talked as much as I did if\nnot more, and that there’s not much you can do\nabout inherited traits.\n\nMr Keesing had a good laugh at my arguments,\nbut when I proceeded to talk my way through the\nnext lesson, he assigned me a second essay. This\ntime it was supposed to be on ‘An Incorrigible\nChatterbox’. I handed it in, and Mr Keesing had\nnothing to complain about for two whole lessons.\nHowever, during the third lesson he’d finally had\nenough. “Anne Frank, as punishment for talking in\nclass, write an essay entitled — ‘Quack, Quack,\nQuack, Said Mistress Chatterbox’.” __\n\ninherited traits\nqualities (physical or\nmental) that one gets\nfrom one’s parents\n\nincorrigible\nsomething that\ncannot be corrected\n(usually a bad\nquality)\n\nThe class roared. I had to laugh too, though I’d\nnearly exhausted my ingenuity on the topic of\nchatterboxes. It was time to come up with\nsomething else, something original. My friend,\nSanne, who’s good at poetry, offered to help me write\nthe essay from beginning to end in verse and I\njumped for joy. Mr Keesing was trying to play a\njoke on me with this ridiculous subject, but I’d make\nsure the joke was on him.\n\nI finished my poem, and it was beautiful!

Idioms\n\nIdioms are groups of words with a fixed order, and a particular meaning,\ndifferent from the meanings of each of their words put together. (Phrasal\nverbs can also be idioms; they are said to be ‘idiomatic’ when their meaning\nis unpredictable.) For example, do you know what it means to ‘meet one’s\nmatch’ in English? It means to meet someone who is as good as oneself, or\neven better, in some skill or quality. Do you know what it means to ‘let the\ncat out of the bag’? Can you guess?\n\n1. Here are a few sentences from the text which have idiomatic\nexpressions. Can you say what each means?

Here are a few more idiomatic expressions that occur in the text.\nTry to use them in sentences of your own.\n\n(i) caught my eye (iii) laugh ourselves silly\n(ii) he’d had enough (iv) can’t bring myself to\n\nIV. Do you know how to use a dictionary to find out the meanings of idiomatic\nexpressions? Take, for example, the expression caught my eye in the story.\nWhere — under which word — would you look for it in the dictionary?\n\nLook for it under the first word. But if the first word is a ‘grammatical’ word\nlike a, the, for, etc., then take the next word. That is, look for the first\n‘meaningful’ word in the expression. In our example, it is the word caught.\n\nBut you won't find caught in the dictionary, because it is the past tense of\ncatch. You'll find caught listed under catch. So you must look under catch for\nthe expression caught my eye. Which other expressions with catch are listed\nin your dictionary?\n\nNote that a dictionary entry usually first gives the meanings of the word\nitself, and then gives a list of idiomatic expressions using that word. For\nexample, study this partial entry for the noun ‘eye’ from the Oxford Advanced\nLearner’s Dictionary, 2005.\n\n|\n\nEye\n\ne Noun\n\ne Part of Body 1 [C] either of the two organs on the face that you see\nwith: The suspect has dark hair and green eyes.\n\ne Ability to See 3 [sing.] the ability to see: A surgeon needs a good eye\nand a steady hand.\n\ne Way of Seeing 4 [C, usually sing.] a particular way of seeing sth: He\nlooked at the design with the eye of an engineer.\n\ne Of Needle 5 [C] the hole in the end of a needle that you put the thread\nthrough.\n\nIDM be all eyes to be watching sb/sth carefully and with a lot of interest\nbefore/in front of sb’s (very) eyes in sb’s presence; in front of sb: He had\nseen his life’s work destroyed before his very eyes.

Contracted Forms\nWhen we speak, we use ‘contracted forms’ or short forms such as these:\ncan’t (for can not or cannot) Id (for Iwould or Ihad) _ she’s (for she is)\nNotice that contracted forms are also written with an apostrophe to show a\nshortening of the spelling of not, would, or is as in the above example.\n\nWriting a diary is like speaking to oneself. Plays (and often, novels) also have\nspeech in written form. So we usually come across contracted forms in\ndiaries, plays and novels.\n\n1. Make a list of the contracted forms in the text. Rewrite them as full\nforms of two words.\nFor example:\nI've = I have\n2. We have seen that some contracted forms can stand for two different\nfull forms:\nI'd =I had or I would\n\nFind in the text the contracted forms that stand for two different\nfull forms, and say what these are.\n\nSpeaking 4\n\nHere is an extract adapted from a one-act play. In this extract, angry neighbours\nwho think Joe the Inventor’s new spinning machine will make them lose their\njobs come to destroy Joe’s model of the machine.\n\nYou've just seen how contracted forms can make a written text sound like actual\nspeech. Try to make this extract sound more like a real conversation by changing\nsome of the verbs back into contracted forms. Then speak out the lines.\n\n[The door is flung open, and several men tramp in. They carry sticks, and one\nof them, Hos, has a hammer.]\n\nMos : Now where is your husband, mistress?\nMary : In his bed. He is sick, and weary.

Can you keep a diary for a\nweek recording the events that occur? You may share your diary with your\nclass, if you wish to. Use the following hints to write your diary.\n\n¢ Though your diary is very private, write as if you are writing for someone else.\ne Present your thoughts in a convincing manner.\n\n¢ Use words that convey your feelings, and words that ‘paint pictures’ for the\nreader. Be brief.\n\n‘Diary language’ has some typical features such as subjectless sentences (Got\nup late in the morning), sentence fragments without subjects or verbs (...too\nbad, boring, not good), contracted forms (they're, I’ve, can’t, didn’t, etc.), and\neveryday expressions which people use in speech. Remember not to use such\nlanguage in more formal kinds of writing.\n\nListening 4\n\nYour teacher will read out an extract from The Diary of Samuel Pepys (given on\nthe next page) about the great fire of London.

Diary writing is one of the best ways to practise writing. Students do not have to\nthink up or imagine what to write about; they only have to find words to write\nabout what has happened. Initiate your students into the habit of keeping a diary.\n\n2. Anne Frank’s diary became a public document after World War II. Discuss with your\nstudents diaries which became historical documents, such as Samuel Pepys’s diary.\nYou may draw students’ attention to different types of diaries, e.g. private diary,\ngeneral diary. Army officers, businessmen, doctors, executives, lawyers, motorists,\npolice officers keep a general diary to record events that happen during the day\nand events that are scheduled for the day, such as appointments, meetings, things\nto be done, etc.\n\n3.

After two years in hiding, the group was betrayed\nand transported to the concentration camp system where Anne died\nof typhus in Bergen-Belsen within days of her sister, Margot Frank.\nHer father, Otto, the only survivor of the group, returned to Amsterdam\nafter the war ended, to find that her diary had been saved. Convinced\nthat it was a unique record, he took action to have it published in\nEnglish under the name The Diary of a Young Girl.\nThe diary was given to Anne Frank for her thirteenth birthday\nand chronicles the events of her life from 12 June 1942 until its\nJinal entry of 1 August 1944. It was eventually translated from its\noriginal Dutch into many languages and became one of the world’s\nmost widely read books.

        "text": "First Flight\n\nWaritinc in a diary is a really strange experience for\nsomeone like me. Not only because I’ve never written\nanything before, but also because it seems to me\nthat later on neither I nor anyone else will be\ninterested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old\nschoolgirl. Oh well, it doesn’t matter. I feel like\nwriting, and I have an even greater need to get all\nkinds of things off my chest.\n\n‘Paper has more patience than people.’ I thought\nof this saying on one of those days when I was feeling\na little depressed and was sitting at home with my\nchin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering\nwhether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I\nwas, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience,\nand since I’m not planning to let anyone else read\nthis stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a\n‘diary’, unless I should ever find a real friend, it\nprobably won’t make a bit of difference.\n\nNow I’m back to the point that prompted me\nto keep a diary in the first place: I don’t have a\nfriend.\n\nLet me put it more clearly, since no one will\nbelieve that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely\nalone in the world. And I’m not. I have loving parents\nand a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about\nthirty people I can call friends. I have a family,\nloving aunts and a good home.

I jotted down the\ntitle in my notebook, tucked it in my bag and tried\nto keep quiet.\n\nThat evening, after I’d finished the rest of my\nhomework, the note about the essay caught my eye.\nI began thinking about the subject while chewing\nthe tip of my fountain pen.

Students do not have to\nthink up or imagine what to write about; they only have to find words to write\nabout what has happened. Initiate your students into the habit of keeping a diary.\n\n2. Anne Frank’s diary became a public document after World War II. Discuss with your\nstudents diaries which became historical documents, such as Samuel Pepys’s diary.\nYou may draw students’ attention to different types of diaries, e.g. private diary,\ngeneral diary. Army officers, businessmen, doctors, executives, lawyers, motorists,\npolice officers keep a general diary to record events that happen during the day\nand events that are scheduled for the day, such as appointments, meetings, things\nto be done, etc.\n\n3. Passage for listening exercise:\n\nThe Great Fire of London [1666]\n\nSeptember 2nd (Lord’s Day). Jane called us up about three in the morning,\nto tell us of a great fire they saw in the city. So | rose and slipped on my\nnightgown, and went to her window, and thought it to be on the backside\nof Marke-Lane at the farthest; but being unused to such fire as followed,\n| thought it far enough off, and so went to bed again and to sleep.\n\nAbout seven rose again to dress myself, and then looked out of the\nwindow, and saw the fire not so much as it was and further off. By and by\nJane comes and tells me that she hears that above 300 houses have\nbeen burned down tonight by the fire we saw, and that it is now burning\ndown all Fish Street, by London Bridge.\n\nSo | made myself ready presently, and walked to the Tower, and there got\nup upon one of the high places, Sir J. Robinson’s little son going up with\nme; and there | did see the houses at that end of the bridge all on fire,\nand an infinite great fire on this and the other side of the bridge.\n\n[From The Diary of Samuel Pepys ]\n\nWhat You Can Do\n\nAfter they have completed the lesson, including the writing exercise, students can be\nasked to make a diary jotting for the previous day. Perhaps you could also write a diary\nentry describing what happened in school/class on the previous day, to share with the\nclass — try and make it amusing and interesting!

Unfortunately\n\ntheir cute looks are often a disadvantage, because people\n\npurchase them without consideration and the knowledge on\n\nhow to take proper care of them. The basic points you should\n\nkeep in mind before adopting a puppy are:\n\ne an annual dog licence in accordance with government\nregulations\n\ne its annual vaccination against major diseases\n\ne toilet training\n\ne regular grooming and bathing\n\ne obedience training\n\ne don’t forget you should feed your pet a balanced diet\n\ne socialisation (many dogs are kept confined in cages or tied\nup to stop them from dirtying the garden or from chewing\non shoes — this is wrong) is very important\n\ne a daily dose of exercise, affection and play.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nReading up on the subject beforehand is another\nimportant requirement and will guide you towards being a\nresponsible pet owner.

Then lead students into\na discussion about the ethics of keeping wild animals as pets: What are the difficulties\nthese may entail?

Unfortunately\n\ntheir cute looks are often a disadvantage, because people\n\npurchase them without consideration and the knowledge on\n\nhow to take proper care of them. The basic points you should\n\nkeep in mind before adopting a puppy are:\n\ne an annual dog licence in accordance with government\nregulations\n\ne its annual vaccination against major diseases\n\ne toilet training\n\ne regular grooming and bathing\n\ne obedience training\n\ne don’t forget you should feed your pet a balanced diet\n\ne socialisation (many dogs are kept confined in cages or tied\nup to stop them from dirtying the garden or from chewing\non shoes — this is wrong) is very important\n\ne a daily dose of exercise, affection and play.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

She was eight years old and very\ncurious about things. Her favourite pastime was\nstanding in the front doorway of her house,\nwatching what was happening in the street outside.\nThere were no playmates of her own age on her\nstreet, and this was about all she had to do.\n\nBut for Valli, standing at the front door was every\nbit as enjoyable as any of the elaborate games other\nchildren played. Watching the street gave her many\nnew unusual experiences.\n\nWy \\\n\nOE ;\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n=\n2\ni\n2\nB\n~\ni\n3\n=\nie)\n=]\n&\n\n\nFirst Flight\n\nThe most fascinating thing of all was the bus\nthat travelled between her village and the nearest\ntown. It passed through her street each hour, once\ngoing to the town and once coming back. The sight\nof the bus, filled each time with a new set of\npassengers, was a source of unending joy for Valli.\n\nDay after day she watched the bus, and\ngradually a tiny wish crept into her head and\ngrew there: she wanted to ride on that bus, even\nif just once. This wish became stronger and\nstronger, until it was an overwhelming desire.\nValli would stare wistfully at the people who got\non or off the bus when it stopped at the street\ncorner. Their faces would kindle in her longings,\ndreams, and hopes. If one of her friends happened\nto ride the bus and tried to describe the sights of\nthe town to her, Valli would be too jealous to listen\nand would shout, in English: “Proud! proud!”\nNeither she nor her friends really understood the\nmeaning of the word, but they used it often as a\nslang expression of disapproval.\n\nOver many days and months Valli listened\ncarefully to conversations between her neighbours\nand people who regularly used the bus, and she also\nasked a few discreet questions here and there. This\nway she picked up various small details about the\nbus journey. The town was six miles from her village.\nThe fare was thirty paise one way — “which is almost\nnothing at all,” she heard one well-dressed man say,\nbut to Valli, who scarcely saw that much money\nfrom one month to the next, it seemed a fortune. The\ntrip to the town took forty-five minutes. On reaching\ntown, if she stayed in her seat and paid another\nthirty paise, she could return home on the same\nbus. This meant that she could take the one-o’clock\nafternoon bus, reach the town at one forty-five, and\nbe back home by about two forty-five...\n\nOn and on went her thoughts as she calculated\nand recalculated, planned and replanned.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nwistfully\nlongingly\n\nkindle\nset alight (a fire),\nhere, feelings\n\na slang expression\ninformal words,\noften used within a\nclose group\n\ndiscreet questions\ncareful questions\n\n\n\\l\nOral Comprehension Check as\n\n1.

How did she find out\nthese details?\n\n4. What do you think Valli was planning to do?\n\nIl\n\nWell, one fine spring day the afternoon bus was\njust on the point of leaving the village and turning\ninto the main highway when a small voice was heard\nshouting: “Stop the bus! Stop the bus!” And a tiny\nhand was raised commandingly.\n\nThe bus slowed down to a crawl, and the\nconductor, sticking his head out the door, said,\n“Hurry then! Tell whoever it is to come quickly.”\n\n“It's me,” shouted Valli. “I'm the one who has to\nget on.”\n\nBy now the bus had come to a stop, and the 97\nconductor said, “Oh, really! You don’t say so!”\n“Yes, I simply have to go to town,” said Valli,\nstill standing outside the bus, “and here’s my\nmoney.” She showed him some coins.\n“Okay, okay, but first you must get on the bus,”\nsaid the conductor, and he stretched out a hand to =\nhelp her up. -\n“Never mind,” she said, “I can get on by myself. B\nYou don’t have to help me.” =~\nThe conductor was a jolly sort, fond of joking. “Oh, -\nplease don’t be angry with me, my fine madam,” he =\nsaid. “Here, have a seat right up there in front. .\nEverybody move aside please — make way for madam.” =\n\nIt was the slack time of day, and there were slack time\nonly six or seven passengers on the bus. They were © time when there is\nall looking at Valli and laughing with the conductor. \"t much work\nValli was overcome with shyness. Avoiding\neveryone’s eyes, she walked quickly to an empty\nseat and sat down.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nFirst Flight\n\n“May we start now, madam?” the conductor\nasked, smiling. Then he blew his whistle twice, and\nthe bus moved forward with a roar.\n\nIt was a new bus, its outside painted a gleaming\nwhite with some green stripes along the sides.\nInside, the overhead bars shone like silver. Directly\nin front of Valli, above the windshield, there was a\nbeautiful clock. The seats were soft and luxurious.\n\nValli devoured everything with her eyes. But\nwhen she _ started to look outside, she found her\nview cut off by a canvas blind that covered the lower\npart of her window. So she stood up on the seat\nand peered over the blind.\n\nThe bus was now going along the bank of a canal.\nThe road was very narrow. On one side there was\nthe canal and, beyond it, palm trees, grassland,\ndistant mountains, and the blue, blue sky. On the\nother side was a deep ditch and then acres and\nacres of green fields — green, green, green, as far\nas the eye could see.\n\nOh, it was all so wonderful!\n\nSuddenly she was startled by a voice. “Listen,\nchild,” said the voice, “you shouldn't stand like that.\nSit down.”\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nSitting down, she looked to see who had spoken.\nIt was an elderly man who had honestly been\nconcerned for her, but she was annoyed by\nhis attention.\n\n“There’s nobody here who’s a child,” she said\nhaughtily. “I've paid my thirty paise like everyone\nelse.”\n\nThe conductor chimed in. “Oh, sir, but this is a\nvery grown-up madam. Do you think a mere girl\ncould pay her own fare and travel to the city\nall alone?”\n\nValli shot an angry glance at the conductor and\nsaid, “I am not a madam. Please remember that.\nAnd you've not yet given me my ticket.”\n\n“Tl remember,” the conductor said, mimicking\nher tone. Everyone laughed, and gradually Valli too\njoined in the laughter.\n\nThe conductor punched a ticket and handed it\nto her. “Just sit back and make yourself comfortable.\nWhy should you stand when you've paid for a seat?”\n\n“Because I want to,” she answered, standing\nup again.\n\n“But if you stand on the seat, you may fall and\nhurt yourself when the bus makes a sharp turn\nor hits a bump. That’s why we want you to sit\ndown, child.”\n\n“Tm not a child, I tell you,” she said irritably.\n“I'm eight years old.”\n\n“Of course, of course. How stupid of me! Eight\nyears — my!”\n\nThe bus stopped, some new passengers got on,\nand the conductor got busy for a time. Afraid of\nlosing her seat, Valli finally sat down.\n\nAn elderly woman came and sat beside her. “Are\nyou all alone, dear?” she asked Valli as the bus\nstarted again.\n\nValli found the woman absolutely repulsive — such\nbig holes she had in her ear lobes, and such ugly\nearrings in them! And she could smell the betel nut\nthe woman was chewing and see the betel juice that\nwas threatening to spill over her lips at any moment.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nhaughtily\nproudly\n\nmimicking\ncopying\n\nrepulsive\ncausing strong\ndislike\n\n99\n\nsq “ui soPry wePPl\n\n\nFirst Flight\n\n~\n9\n9\n\nUgh! — who could be sociable with such a person?\n\n“Yes, I’m travelling alone,’\n\n9\n\nshe answered curtly.\n\n“And I’ve got a ticket too.” curtly\n“Yes, she’s on her way to town,” said the showing displeasure\nconductor. “With a thirty-paise ticket.”\n“Oh, why don’t you mind your own business,”\nsaid Valli.

She had\n\nthriftily saved whatever stray coins came her way,\n\nresisting every temptation to buy peppermints, toys, thriftily\nballoons, and the like, and finally she had saved a spend money\n\ntotal of sixty paise.

But lo! somehow it passed on\nsmoothly, leaving all obstacles safely behind. Trees\ncame running towards them but then stopped as\nthe bus reached them and simply stood there\nhelpless for a moment by the side of the road before\nrushing away in the other direction.\n\nSuddenly Valli clapped her hands with glee. A\nyoung cow, tail high in the air, was running very\nfast, right in the middle of the road, right in front\nof the bus. The bus slowed to a crawl, and the driver\nsounded his horn loudly again and again. But the\nmore he honked, the more frightened the animal\nbecame and the faster it galloped — always right in\nfront of the bus.\n\nOat\n\n101\n=\n2\nou\n2\n5\nx\n4 oa\n, ae g\n=\n®\nv=]\na\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nFirst Flight\n\n~\nio)\n1)\n\nSomehow this was very funny to Valli.

And soon the\nbus came to a railroad crossing. A speck of a train\ncould be seen in the distance, growing bigger and\nbigger as it drew near. Then it rushed past the\ncrossing gate with a tremendous roar and rattle,\nshaking the bus. Then the bus went on and passed\nthe train station. From there it traversed a busy,\nwell-laid-out shopping street and, turning, entered\na wider thoroughfare. Such big, bright-looking\nshops! What glittering displays of clothes and other\nmerchandise! Such big crowds!\n\nStruck dumb with wonder, Valli gaped at everything.\n\nThen the bus stopped and everyone got off\nexcept Valli.\n\n“Hey, lady,” said the conductor, “aren’t you ready\nto get off? This is as far as your thirty paise\ntakes you.”\n\n“No,” Valli said, “I’m going back on this same\nbus.” She took another thirty paise from her pocket\nand handed the coins to the conductor.\n\n“Why, is something the matter?”\n\n“No, nothing’s the matter. I just felt like having\na bus ride, that’s all.”\n\n“Don’t you want to have a look at the sights,\nnow that you’re here?”\n\n“All by myself? Oh, ’d be much too afraid.”\n\nGreatly amused by the girl’s way of speaking,\nthe conductor said, “But you weren’t afraid to come\nin the bus.”\n\n“Nothing to be afraid of about that,” she\nanswered.\n\n“Well, then, why not go to that stall over there\nand have something to drink?

But suddenly she saw a young cow lying\ndead by the roadside, just where it had been struck\nby some fast-moving vehicle.\n\n“Isn’t that the same cow that ran in front of the\nbus on our trip to town?” she asked the conductor.\n\nThe conductor nodded, and she was overcome\nwith sadness. What had been a lovable, beautiful\ncreature just a little while ago had now suddenly\nlost its charm and its life and looked so horrible, so\nfrightening as it lay there, legs spreadeagled, a fixed\nstare in its lifeless eyes, blood all over...\n\nThe bus moved on.

The students should be given two or three days to collect old (used) tickets from\ntheir friends, relatives and acquaintances: they could be bus tickets, train tickets,\nplane tickets, cinema tickets, tickets to cultural events, etc. By the time they finish\nthe lesson they should be able to get a good collection in place. Get them to make\na collage using as many as possible of the tickets collected, on a sheet of poster\npaper. This can then form the basis for many interesting activities: classification\naccording to type of tickets (for what?) or price (how much?), etc; the most desirable\ntickets, the tickets no one wants, etc. — let students think of more ways to classify\nthem. Get students to write a paragraph with the collage as base, and their\nimagination as guide.\n\n2. You can also ask the students do the following.\n\n(i) In the story Valli has to save money and make plans to be able to ride the\nbus. In pairs, discuss how you spent your pocket money last month. Did you\nspend it on yourself, or on someone dear to you?\n\n(ii) Valli's enthusiasm is dampened and the memory of the dead cow haunts her.\nIn groups, discuss an incident which may have troubled or discouraged you.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nThe Tale of Custard\nthe Dragon\n\nThis poem is written in the style of a ballad — a song\n\nor poem that tells a story. You must be familiar with ballads that\nnarrate tales of courage or heroism. This poem is a humorous\nballad close to a parody.\n\nRead it aloud, paying attention to the rhythm.\n\nBelinda lived in a little white house,\n\nWith a little black kitten and a little grey mouse,\nAnd a little yellow dog and a little red wagon,\nAnd a realio, trulio, little pet dragon.\n\nNow the name of the little black kitten was Ink,\nAnd the little grey mouse, she called him Blink,\nAnd the little yellow dog was sharp as Mustard,\nBut the dragon was a coward, and she called him Custard.\n\nCustard the dragon had big sharp teeth,\n\nAnd spikes on top of him and scales underneath,\nMouth like a fireplace, chimney for a nose,\n\nAnd realio, trulio daggers on his toes.\n\nBelinda was as brave as a barrel full of bears,\nAnd Ink and Blink chased lions down the stairs,\nMustard was as brave as a tiger in a rage,\n\nBut Custard cried for a nice safe cage.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nFirst Flight\n\n~\nfo}\noe)\n\nBelinda tickled him, she tickled him unmerciful,\n\nInk, Blink and Mustard, they rudely called him Percival,\nThey all sat laughing in the little red wagon\n\nAt the realio, trulio, cowardly dragon.\n\nBelinda giggled till she shook the house,\n\nAnd Blink said Weeck! which is giggling for a mouse,\nInk and Mustard rudely asked his age,\n\nWhen Custard cried for a nice safe cage.\n\nSuddenly, suddenly they heard a nasty sound,\nAnd Mustard growled, and they all looked around.\nMeowch! cried Ink, and ooh! cried Belinda,\n\nFor there was a pirate, climbing in the winda.\n\nPistol in his left hand, pistol in his right,\nAnd he held in his teeth a cutlass bright,\nHis beard was black, one leg was wood;\n\nIt was clear that the pirate meant no good.\n\nBelinda paled, and she cried Help! Help!\n\nBut Mustard fled with a terrified yelp,\n\nInk trickled down to the bottom of the household,\nAnd little mouse Blink strategically mouseholed.\n\nBut up jumped Custard, snorting like an engine,\nClashed his tail like irons in a dungeon,\n\nWith a clatter and a clank and a jangling squirm,\nHe went at the pirate like a robin at a worm.\n\nThe pirate gaped at Belinda’s dragon,\n\nAnd gulped some grog from his pocket flagon,\nHe fired two bullets, but they didn’t hit,\n\nAnd Custard gobbled him, every bit.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nBelinda embraced him, Mustard licked him,\nNo one mourned for his pirate victim.\n\nInk and Blink in glee did gyrate\n\nAround the dragon that ate the pirate.\n\nBut presently up spoke little dog Mustard,\n\nI'd have been twice as brave if I hadn’t been flustered.\nAnd up spoke Ink and up spoke Blink,\n\nWe'd have been three times as brave, we think,\n\nAnd Custard said, I quite agree\n\nThat everybody is braver than me.\n\nBelinda still lives in her little white house,\n\nWith her little black kitten and her little grey mouse,\nAnd her little yellow dog and her little red wagon,\nAnd her realio, trulio little pet dragon.\n\nBelinda is as brave as a barrel full of bears,\nAnd Ink and Blink chase lions down the stairs,\nMustard is as brave as a tiger in a rage,\n\nBut Custard keeps crying for a nice safe cage.\n\nOGDEN Nasu\n\nOgden Nash wrote over four hundred pieces of comic verse. The\nbest of his work was published in 14 volumes between 1931 and\n1972. His work is perhaps best described in this poetic tribute by\n_ Anthony Burgess:\n\n...he brought a new kind of sound to our literary diversions.\n\nAnd didn’t care much about breaking the poetic laws of the Medes\n\nand the Persians.\n\nHe uses lines, sometimes of considerable length that are colloquial\n\nand prosy.\n\nAnd at the end presents you with a rhyme...\n\nThis bringing together of the informal and the formal is what his\n\ngenius chiefly loves.\n\n| am trying to imitate him here, but he is probably quite inimitable.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n=\n=\nlo)\na\na\nlo)\n°\n2\nOO\nc\na\ne\n2\nLt\nou\n_\n>=\nlo)\n=)\na\n2\nico}\n°\n=]\n\n\nFirst Flight\n\n110\n\nGlossary 4\n\ngrog: a drink typically drunk by sailors\n\ngyrate: to move around in circles\n\n5 Thinking about the Poem\n\n1.\n2.\n\n3.\n\nWho are the characters in this poem?

It passed through her street each hour, once\ngoing to the town and once coming back. The sight\nof the bus, filled each time with a new set of\npassengers, was a source of unending joy for Valli.\n\nDay after day she watched the bus, and\ngradually a tiny wish crept into her head and\ngrew there: she wanted to ride on that bus, even\nif just once. This wish became stronger and\nstronger, until it was an overwhelming desire.\nValli would stare wistfully at the people who got\non or off the bus when it stopped at the street\ncorner.

This\nway she picked up various small details about the\nbus journey. The town was six miles from her village.\nThe fare was thirty paise one way — “which is almost\nnothing at all,” she heard one well-dressed man say,\nbut to Valli, who scarcely saw that much money\nfrom one month to the next, it seemed a fortune. The\ntrip to the town took forty-five minutes. On reaching\ntown, if she stayed in her seat and paid another\nthirty paise, she could return home on the same\nbus.

This can then form the basis for many interesting activities: classification\naccording to type of tickets (for what?) or price (how much?), etc; the most desirable\ntickets, the tickets no one wants, etc. — let students think of more ways to classify\nthem. Get students to write a paragraph with the collage as base, and their\nimagination as guide.\n\n2. You can also ask the students do the following.\n\n(i) In the story Valli has to save money and make plans to be able to ride the\nbus. In pairs, discuss how you spent your pocket money last month.

At twelve, he was sent away for schooling in\nthe Hindu sacred scriptures and four years later he\nreturned home to marry a princess. They had a son\nand lived for ten years as befitted royalty. At about\nthe age of twenty-five, the Prince, heretofore shielded\nfrom the sufferings of the world, while out hunting\nchanced upon a sick man, then an aged man, then\na funeral procession, and finally a monk begging\nfor alms. These sights so moved him that he at\nonce went out into the world to seek enlightenment\nconcerning the sorrows he had witnessed.\nHe wandered for seven years and finally sat\ndown under a peepal tree, where he vowed to stay\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nchanced upon\ncame across by\nchance\n\nenlightenment\na state of high\nspiritual knowledge\n\n\nFirst Flight\n\n~\n~\ni)\n\nuntil enlightenment came. Enlightened after seven\ndays, he renamed the tree the Bodhi Tree (Tree of\nWisdom) and began to teach and to share his new\nunderstandings. At that point he became known as\nthe Buddha (the Awakened or the Enlightened). The\nBuddha preached his first sermon at the city of\nBenares, most holy of the dipping places on the River\nGanges; that sermon has been preserved and is given\nhere. It reflects the Buddha’s wisdom about one\ninscrutable kind of suffering.\n\nKisa Gotami had an only son, and he died. In her grief\nshe carried the dead child to all her neighbours, asking\nthem for medicine, and the people said, “She has lost\nher senses. The boy is dead.”\n\nAt length, Kisa Gotami met a man who replied to her\nrequest, “I cannot give thee medicine for thy child, but I\nknow a physician who can.”\n\nAnd the girl said, “Pray tell me, sir; who is it?” And\nthe man replied, \"Go to Sakyamuni, the Buddha.”\n\nKisa Gotami repaired to the Buddha and cried, “Lord\nand Master, give me the medicine that will cure my boy.”\n\nThe Buddha answered, “I want a handful of mustard-\nseed.” And when the girl in her joy promised to procure\nit, the Buddha added, “The mustard-seed must be taken\nfrom a house where no one has lost a child, husband,\nparent or friend.”\n\nPoor Kisa Gotami now went from house to house,\nand the people pitied her and said, “Here is mustard-\nseed; take it!” But when she asked, “Did a son or\ndaughter, a father or mother, die in your family?” they\nanswered her, “Alas! the living are few, but the dead are\nmany. Do not remind us of our deepest grief.” And there\nwas no house but some beloved one had died in it.\n\nKisa Gotami became weary and hopeless, and sat\ndown at the wayside watching the lights of the city, as\nthey flickered up and were extinguished again. At last\nthe darkness of the night reigned everywhere. And she\nconsidered the fate of men, that their lives flicker up\nand are extinguished again. And she thought to herself,\n“How selfish am I in my grief! Death is common to all;\nyet in this valley of desolation there is a path that leads\nhim to immortality who has surrendered all selfishness.”\n\nThe Buddha said, “The life of mortals in this world\nis troubled and brief and combined with pain.

As ripe fruits are early\n\nin danger of falling, so mortals when born are always in\n\ndanger of death. As all earthen vessels made by the\n\npotter end in being broken, so is the life of mortals. Both\n\nyoung and adult, both those who are fools and those\n\nwho are wise, all fall into the power of death; all are\n\nsubject to death.\n“Of those who, overcome by death, depart from life,\n\na father cannot save his son, nor kinsmen their relations.\n\nMark! while relatives are looking on and lamenting\n\ndeeply, one by one mortals are carried off, like an ox\n\nthat is led to the slaughter.

Discuss this in groups or in class.\n\nI.,A Guide to Coping with the Death\nof a Loved One\n\nMartha is having difficulty sleeping lately and no longer enjoys doing things\nwith her friends. Martha lost her husband of 26 years to cancer a month ago.\nAnya, age 17, doesn’t feel like eating and spends the days in her room\ncrying. Her grandmother recently died.\nBoth of these individuals are experiencing grief. Grief is an emotion\nnatural to all types of loss or significant change.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nFeelings of Grief\n\nAlthough grief is unique and personal, a broad range of feelings and\n\nbehaviours are commonly experienced after the death of a loved one.\n\ne Sadness. This is the most common, and it is not necessarily manifested\nby crying.\n\ne Anger. This is one of the most confusing feelings for a survivor. There\nmay be frustration at not being able to prevent the death, and a sense\nof not being able to exist without the loved one.\n\ne Guilt and Self-reproach. People may believe that they were not kind\nenough or caring enough to the person who died, or that the person\nshould have seen the doctor sooner.\n\ne Anxiety. An individual may fear that she/he won't be able to care for\nherself/himself.\n\ne Loneliness. There are reminders throughout the day that a partner,\nfamily member or friend is gone. For example, meals are no longer\nprepared the same way, phone calls to share a special moment don’t\nhappen.\n\ne Fatigue. There is an overall sense of feeling tired.\n\ne Disbelief. This occurs particularly if it was a sudden death.\n\nHelping Others Who Are Experiencing Grief\n\nWhen a friend, loved one, or co-worker is experiencing grief—how can we\nhelp? It helps to understand that grief is expressed through a variety of\nbehaviours.\n\nReach out to others in their grief, but understand that some may not\nwant to accept help and will not share their grief. Others will want to\ntalk about their thoughts and feelings or reminisce.\n\nBe patient and let the grieving person know that you care and are\nthere to support him or her.\n\nII..Good Grief\nAmirali ETZIONI\n\nSoon after my wife died — her car slid off an icy road in 1985 — a school\npsychologist warned me that my children and I were not mourning in the\nright way. We felt angry; the proper first stage, he said, is denial.\n\nIn late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his\nsleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child.\n\nThere is no set form for grief, and no ‘right’ way to express it. There\nseems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress\nsystematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are\ntold, to jump to anger — or to wallow too long in this stage before moving\ntowards acceptance.\n\n=\n=\no\nMN\nic)\net\nB\n°\n=)\n2\nEo\nem\nic)\n=}\n2\nLt\nOo\na\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nFirst Flight\n\n116\n\nBut I was, and am, angry. To make parents bury their children is wrong;\nto have both my wife and son taken from me, for forever and a day, is cruel\nbeyond words.\n\nA relative from Jerusalem, who is a psychiatrist, brought some solace by\nciting the maxim: ‘We are not to ask why, but what.’ The ‘what’ is that which\nsurvivors in grief are bound to do for one another. Following that advice, my\nfamily, close friends and I keep busy, calling each other and giving long\nanswers to simple questions like, “How did your day go today?” We try to\navoid thinking about either the immediate past or the bereft future. We take\nturns playing with Max, Michael’s two-year-old son. Friends spend nights\nwith the young widow, and will be among those holding her hand when the\nbaby is born.\n\nFocusing on what we do for one another is the only consolation we\ncan find.\n\nWriting 4\n\nWrite a page (about three paragraphs) on one of the following topics.

Enlightened after seven\ndays, he renamed the tree the Bodhi Tree (Tree of\nWisdom) and began to teach and to share his new\nunderstandings. At that point he became known as\nthe Buddha (the Awakened or the Enlightened). The\nBuddha preached his first sermon at the city of\nBenares, most holy of the dipping places on the River\nGanges; that sermon has been preserved and is given\nhere. It reflects the Buddha’s wisdom about one\ninscrutable kind of suffering.\n\nKisa Gotami had an only son, and he died. In her grief\nshe carried the dead child to all her neighbours, asking\nthem for medicine, and the people said, “She has lost\nher senses. The boy is dead.”\n\nAt length, Kisa Gotami met a man who replied to her\nrequest, “I cannot give thee medicine for thy child, but I\nknow a physician who can.”\n\nAnd the girl said, “Pray tell me, sir; who is it?” And\nthe man replied, \"Go to Sakyamuni, the Buddha.”\n\nKisa Gotami repaired to the Buddha and cried, “Lord\nand Master, give me the medicine that will cure my boy.”\n\nThe Buddha answered, “I want a handful of mustard-\nseed.” And when the girl in her joy promised to procure\nit, the Buddha added, “The mustard-seed must be taken\nfrom a house where no one has lost a child, husband,\nparent or friend.”\n\nPoor Kisa Gotami now went from house to house,\nand the people pitied her and said, “Here is mustard-\nseed; take it!” But when she asked, “Did a son or\ndaughter, a father or mother, die in your family?” they\nanswered her, “Alas! the living are few, but the dead are\nmany. Do not remind us of our deepest grief.” And there\nwas no house but some beloved one had died in it.\n\nKisa Gotami became weary and hopeless, and sat\ndown at the wayside watching the lights of the city, as\nthey flickered up and were extinguished again. At last\nthe darkness of the night reigned everywhere. And she\nconsidered the fate of men, that their lives flicker up\nand are extinguished again. And she thought to herself,\n“How selfish am I in my grief! Death is common to all;\nyet in this valley of desolation there is a path that leads\nhim to immortality who has surrendered all selfishness.”\n\nThe Buddha said, “The life of mortals in this world\nis troubled and brief and combined with pain.

        "text": "Feelings of Grief\n\nAlthough grief is unique and personal, a broad range of feelings and\n\nbehaviours are commonly experienced after the death of a loved one.\n\ne Sadness. This is the most common, and it is not necessarily manifested\nby crying.\n\ne Anger. This is one of the most confusing feelings for a survivor. There\nmay be frustration at not being able to prevent the death, and a sense\nof not being able to exist without the loved one.\n\ne Guilt and Self-reproach. People may believe that they were not kind\nenough or caring enough to the person who died, or that the person\nshould have seen the doctor sooner.\n\ne Anxiety. An individual may fear that she/he won't be able to care for\nherself/himself.\n\ne Loneliness. There are reminders throughout the day that a partner,\nfamily member or friend is gone. For example, meals are no longer\nprepared the same way, phone calls to share a special moment don’t\nhappen.\n\ne Fatigue. There is an overall sense of feeling tired.\n\ne Disbelief. This occurs particularly if it was a sudden death.\n\nHelping Others Who Are Experiencing Grief\n\nWhen a friend, loved one, or co-worker is experiencing grief—how can we\nhelp? It helps to understand that grief is expressed through a variety of\nbehaviours.\n\nReach out to others in their grief, but understand that some may not\nwant to accept help and will not share their grief. Others will want to\ntalk about their thoughts and feelings or reminisce.\n\nBe patient and let the grieving person know that you care and are\nthere to support him or her.\n\nII..Good Grief\nAmirali ETZIONI\n\nSoon after my wife died — her car slid off an icy road in 1985 — a school\npsychologist warned me that my children and I were not mourning in the\nright way. We felt angry; the proper first stage, he said, is denial.\n\nIn late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his\nsleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child.\n\nThere is no set form for grief, and no ‘right’ way to express it. There\nseems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress\nsystematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are\ntold, to jump to anger — or to wallow too long in this stage before moving\ntowards acceptance.\n\n=\n=\no\nMN\nic)\net\nB\n°\n=)\n2\nEo\nem\nic)\n=}\n2\nLt\nOo\na\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

The planning only includes arranging for\nrings, brides’ dress, cars, and a reception. Earlier, the bride’s\nfamily paid for the reception, but now-a-days brides’ and\ngrooms’ families usually share expenses. A Russian wedding\nlasts for two days; some weddings last as long as a week,\nand the occasion becomes something to remember for years.\nThe necessary part of the wedding ceremony is a wedding\nprocession of several cars. The best friends of the groom/\nbride meet before the wedding a few times, make posters,\nwrite speeches and organise contests. When the groom\narrives to fetch the bride for the registration, he has to fight\nto get her! Russians usually live in apartments in tall\nbuildings, and the groom has to climb several stairs to reach\nhis bride. But at each landing he must answer a question\nto be allowed to go up. The bride’s friends ask difficult\nquestions (sometimes about the bride, sometimes just\ndifficult riddles), and the groom must answer with the help\nof his friends. For example, he may be shown a few photos\nof baby girls and he must say which one his bride is. If he\nguesses wrong, he must pay cash to move ahead. After the\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nmarriage registration, the newly-married couple leaves the\nguests for a tour of the city sights. After two or three hours\nof the city tour the couple arrives at the reception. The couple\nsits at a specially arranged table with their family, friends\nand invited guests. The reception starts with toasts to the\ncouple. A wedding toast is a custom where a close friend or\nrelative of the groom or the bride says a few words to wish\nthe couple, then everyone raises their glass of wine, and\ndrink it up at the same moment. The groom is then asked to\nkiss the bride. After a few toasts, people start eating and\ndrinking, and generally have fun. After some time, the bride\ngets ‘stolen’! She disappears, and when the groom starts\nlooking for her, he is asked to pay a fee. Usually it is his\nfriends who ‘steal’ the bride. Then there are the bride’s\nfriends — they steal the bride’s shoe. The groom must pay\nmoney for the shoe too. The guests enjoy watching these\ntussles, and continue partying.\n\n2. Do you think Indian and Russian weddings have any customs\nin common? With the help of a partner, fill in the table below.\n\nWedding Ceremonies in Russia and India\n\nCustoms similar to Customs different from\nIndian ones Indian ones\n\n“The Proposal” (originally titled “A Marriage Proposal’) is a one-\nact play, a farce, by the Russian short story writer and dramatist\nAnton Chekhov. It was written in 1888-89.\n\nThe play is about the tendency of wealthy families to seek ties\nwith other wealthy families, to increase their estates by encouraging\nmarriages that make good economic sense. Ivan Lomov, a long time\nwealthy neighbour of Stepan Chubukov, also wealthy, comes to\nseek the hand of Chubukov’s twenty-five-year-old daughter, Natalya.\nAll three are quarrelsome people, and they quarrel over petty issues.\nThe proposal is in danger of being forgotten amidst all this\nquarrelling.

Reported Speech\n\nA sentence in reported speech consists of two parts: a reporting clause,\nwhich contains the reporting verb, and the reported clause. Look at the\nfollowing sentences.\n\n(a) “I went to visit my grandma last week,” said Mamta.\n(b) Mamta said that she had gone to visit her grandma the previous week.\n\nIn sentence (a), we have Mamta’s exact words. This is an example of direct\nspeech. In sentence (b), someone is reporting what Mamta said. This is\ncalled indirect speech or reported speech. A sentence in reported speech\nis made up of two parts — a reporting clause and a reported clause.\n\nIn sentence (b), Mamta said is the reporting clause containing the reporting\nverb said. The other clause — that she had gone to visit her grandma last\nweek — is the reported clause.\n\nNotice that in sentence (b) we put the reporting clause first. This is done to\nshow that we are not speaking directly, but reporting someone else’s words.\nThe tense of the verb also changes; past tense (went) becomes past perfect\n(had gone).\n\nHere are some pairs of sentences in direct and reported speech. Read them\ncarefully, and do the task that follows:\n\n1. (i) Lomov : Honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, do you think I may count\n\non her consent? (Direct Speech)\n\n(ii) Lomov asked Stepan Stepanovitch respectfully if he thought he might\ncount on her consent. (Reported Speech)\n\n2. (i) Lomov : Im getting a noise in my ears from excitement. (Direct\nSpeech)\n(ii) Lomov said that he was getting a noise in his ears from excitement.\n(Reported Speech)\n\n3. (i) Natatya  : Why haven’t you been here for such a long time? (Direct\nSpeech)\n(ii) Natalya Stepanovna asked why he hadn’t been there for such a long\ntime. (Reported Speech)\n\n4. (i) Cuusuxov : What’s the matter? (Direct Speech)\n(ii) Chubukov asked him what the matter was. (Reported Speech)\n5. (i) Natatya : My mowers will be there this very day! (Direct Speech)\ni)\n\nNatalya Stepanovna declared that her mowers would be there that\nvery day. (Reported Speech)\n\nYou must have noticed that when we report someone’s exact words, we\nhave to make some changes in the sentence structure. In the following\nsentences fill in the blanks to list the changes that have occurred in\nthe above pairs of sentences. One has been done for you.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nIll.\n\n1.

When the verb in direct speech is in the present tense, the verb in reported\nspeech is in the _________ tense (as in Sentence Set 3).\n\n5. If the verb in direct speech is in the present continuous tense, the verb\nin reported speech changes to ___________ tense. For example,\nchanges to was getting.\n\n6. When the sentence in direct speech contains a word denoting respect, we\nadd the adverb __________ in the reporting clause (as in Sentence Set 1).\n\n7. The pronouns J, me, our and mine, which are used in the first person in\ndirect speech, change according to the subject or object of the reporting\nverb such as ; ; or in\nreported speech.\n\nHere is an excerpt from an article from the Times of India. dated\n27 August 2006.

A Russian wedding\nlasts for two days; some weddings last as long as a week,\nand the occasion becomes something to remember for years.\nThe necessary part of the wedding ceremony is a wedding\nprocession of several cars. The best friends of the groom/\nbride meet before the wedding a few times, make posters,\nwrite speeches and organise contests. When the groom\narrives to fetch the bride for the registration, he has to fight\nto get her! Russians usually live in apartments in tall\nbuildings, and the groom has to climb several stairs to reach\nhis bride. But at each landing he must answer a question\nto be allowed to go up. The bride’s friends ask difficult\nquestions (sometimes about the bride, sometimes just\ndifficult riddles), and the groom must answer with the help\nof his friends. For example, he may be shown a few photos\nof baby girls and he must say which one his bride is. If he\nguesses wrong, he must pay cash to move ahead. After the\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

Oxen Meadows are ours,\n\nnot yours!\nNo, mine, honoured Natalya Stepanovna.\n\n: Well, I never knew that before. How do you make that\n\nout?\n\nHow? I’m speaking of those Oxen Meadows which are\nwedged in between your birchwoods and the Burnt\nMarsh.\n\n: Yes, yes... they’re ours.\n\nNo, you’re mistaken, honoured Natalya Stepanovna,\nthey’re mine.\n\n: Just think, Ivan Vassilevitch! How long have they been\n\nyours?\n\nHow long? As long as I can remember.\n\nReally, you won't get me to believe that!\n\nBut you can see from the documents, honoured Natalya\nStepanovna. Oxen Meadows, it’s true, were once the\nsubject of dispute, but now everybody knows that they\nare mine. There’s nothing to argue about. You see my\naunt’s grandmother gave the free use of these Meadows\nin perpetuity to the peasants of your father’s grandfather,\nin return for which they were to make bricks for her. The\npeasants belonging to your father’s grandfather had the\nfree use of the Meadows for forty years, and had got into\nthe habit of regarding them as their own, when it\nhappened that...\n\nNo, it isn’t at all like that! Both grandfather and great-\ngrandfather reckoned that their land extended to Burnt\nMarsh — which means that Oxen Meadows were ours. I\ndon’t see what there is to argue about.

Look at the\nfollowing sentences.\n\n(a) “I went to visit my grandma last week,” said Mamta.\n(b) Mamta said that she had gone to visit her grandma the previous week.\n\nIn sentence (a), we have Mamta’s exact words. This is an example of direct\nspeech. In sentence (b), someone is reporting what Mamta said. This is\ncalled indirect speech or reported speech. A sentence in reported speech\nis made up of two parts — a reporting clause and a reported clause.\n\nIn sentence (b), Mamta said is the reporting clause containing the reporting\nverb said. The other clause — that she had gone to visit her grandma last\nweek — is the reported clause.\n\nNotice that in sentence (b) we put the reporting clause first. This is done to\nshow that we are not speaking directly, but reporting someone else’s words.\nThe tense of the verb also changes; past tense (went) becomes past perfect\n(had gone).\n\nHere are some pairs of sentences in direct and reported speech. Read them\ncarefully, and do the task that follows:\n\n1. (i) Lomov : Honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, do you think I may count\n\non her consent? (Direct Speech)\n\n(ii) Lomov asked Stepan Stepanovitch respectfully if he thought he might\ncount on her consent. (Reported Speech)\n\n2. (i) Lomov : Im getting a noise in my ears from excitement. (Direct\nSpeech)\n(ii) Lomov said that he was getting a noise in his ears from excitement.\n(Reported Speech)\n\n3. (i) Natatya  : Why haven’t you been here for such a long time? (Direct\nSpeech)\n(ii) Natalya Stepanovna asked why he hadn’t been there for such a long\ntime. (Reported Speech)\n\n4. (i) Cuusuxov : What’s the matter? (Direct Speech)\n(ii) Chubukov asked him what the matter was. (Reported Speech)\n5. (i) Natatya : My mowers will be there this very day! (Direct Speech)\ni)\n\nNatalya Stepanovna declared that her mowers would be there that\nvery day. (Reported Speech)\n\nYou must have noticed that when we report someone’s exact words, we\nhave to make some changes in the sentence structure. In the following\nsentences fill in the blanks to list the changes that have occurred in\nthe above pairs of sentences. One has been done for you.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

It seemed a century since I had been sent for by her.\nI kept them all waiting there, and went off into the inner apartments.\nWhen I stepped into our room I had another shock of surprise to find\nBimala there with a distinct suggestion of being dressed up. The room,\nwhich from persistent neglect, had latterly acquired an air of having\ngrown absent-minded, had regained something of its old order this\nafternoon. I stood there silently, looking enquiringly at Bimala.\n\nShe flushed a little and the fingers of her right hand toyed for a time\nwith the bangles on her left arm.

Is it right that ours should be the only market in all Bengal\nwhich allows foreign goods?”\n\n“What, then, would be the right thing to do?” I asked.\n\n“Order them to be cleared out!”\n\n“But the goods are not mine.”\n\n“Is not the market yours?”\n\n“It is much more theirs who use it for trade.”\n\n“Let them trade in Indian goods, then.”\n\n“Nothing would please me better. But suppose they do not?”\n\n“Nonsense! How dare they be so insolent? Are you not...”\n\n“I am very busy this afternoon and cannot stop to argue it out.

This principle marks a\ndeparture from the legacy of bookish learning which\ncontinues to shape our system and causes a gap between\nthe school, home and community. The syllabi and\ntextbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt\nto implement this basic idea. They also attempt to\ndiscourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these\nmeasures will take us significantly further in the direction\nof a child-centered system of education outlined in the\nNational Policy of Education (1986).\n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that\nschool principals and teachers will take to encourage\nchildren to reflect on their own learning and to pursue\nimaginative activities and questions. We must recognise\nthat, given space, time and freedom, children generate new\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to\nthem by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the\nsole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why\nother resources and sites of learning are ignored.\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive\nand treat children as participants in learning, not as\nreceivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\n\nThese aims imply considerable change in school\nroutines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily\ntime-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the\nannual calendar so that the required number of teaching\ndays are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used\nfor teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective\nthis textbook proves for making children’s life at school a\nhappy experience, rather than a source of stress or\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the\nproblem of curricular burden by restructuring and\nreorienting knowledge at different stages with greater\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nconsideration for child psychology and the time available\nfor teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this\nendeavour by giving higher priority and space to\nopportunities for contemplation and wondering,\ndiscussion in small groups, and activities requiring\nhands-on experience.\n\nThe National Council of Educational Research and\nTraining (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the\ntextbook development committee responsible for this book.\nWe wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group\nin languages, Professor Namwar Singh, and the Chief\nAdvisor for this book, Professor R. Amritavalli, for guiding\nthe work of this committee. Several teachers contributed\nto the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their\nprincipals for making this possible. We are indebted to the\ninstitutions and organisations which have generously\npermitted us to draw upon their resources, materials and\npersonnel. We are especially grateful to the members of\nthe National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the\nDepartment of Secondary and Higher Education,\nMinistry of Human Resource Development under the\nChairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and\nProfessor G.P. Deshpande for their valuable time\nand contribution. As an organisation committed to\nsystemic reform and continuous improvement in the\nquality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and\nsuggestions which will enable us to undertake further\nrevision and refinements.\n\nDirector\nNew Delhi National Council of Educational\n20 November 2006 Research and Training\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nRATIONALISATION OF CONTENT\nIN THE TEXTBOOKS\n\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to\nreduce content load on students. The National\nEducation Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the\ncontent load and providing opportunities for\nexperiential learning with creative mindset. In this\nbackground, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise\nto rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning\nOutcomes already developed by the NCERT across\nclasses have been taken into consideration in this\nexercise.\n\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised\nin view of the following:\n\n¢ Content based on genres of literature in the\ntextbooks and supplementary readers at\ndifferent stages of school education\n\n¢ Content that is meant for achieving Learning\nOutcomes for developing language proficiency\nand is accessible at different stages\n\ne For reducing the curriculum load and\nexamination stress in view of the previling\ncondition of the Pandemic\n\ne Content, which is easily accessible to students\nwithout much interventions from teachers and\ncan be learned by children through self-learning\nor peer-learning\n\ne Content, which is irrelevant in the present\ncontext\n\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version\nafter carrying out the changes given above.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nTHE CONSTITUTION OF\nINDIA\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nWE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having\nsolemnly resolved to constitute India intoa | ~\n‘[SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR |\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC] and to secure\n\nto allits citizens :\n\nJUSTICE, social, economic and\npolitical;\n\nLIBERTY of thought, expression, belief,\nfaith and worship;\n\nEQUALITY of status and of opportunity;\nand to promote among them all\n\nFRATERNITY assuring the dignity of\nthe individual and the “[unity and\nintegrity of the Nation];\n\nIN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY | ~\nthis twenty-sixth day of November, 1949 do\nHEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO\nOURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION.\n\n.

The English curriculum lays emphasis on\nproviding a variety of rich, comprehensible inputs to\nlearners to enable their engagement in learning; and\non recognising the multilinguality of everyday\nexperience in India. This textbook aims at helping the\nlearner to read for meaning in context, thus providing\na bank of language to serve as a base for\ncommunication in English.\n\ne This book presents you with texts in a variety of\ngenres, including the diary, the formal address, the\ntravelogue, and the play, on literary, cultural and\nsociological themes that touch upon aspects of life\nrelevant to adolescents. Questions and ideas about\nthe individual and society, the understanding and\nmanagement of one’s emotions, and of one’s place\nin a larger time and space, are here presented both\nby such voices from contemporary history as Nelson\nMandela and Anne Frank, and in fiction from India\nand abroad, chosen for their enduring value. There\nare units that present glimpses of our country, and\ndepict our relationship with the natural world.\n\ne The units in the book have been loosely structured\nin the following way. An introductory section, Before\nYou Read, gives information or activates knowledge\nabout the text to be read, and suggests some warm-\nup activities. Let children participate in these to the\nfullest extent; where necessary or possible, add some\nactivities of your own.\n\ne An innovation made in consultation with teachers is a\nwhile-reading activity, the Oral Comprehension Check,\nwhich aims at a quick, ongoing check that learners are\nindeed following the text up to that point, so that they\ncan progress meaningfully to the parts of the text that\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nfollow. Let learners briefly share their understanding by\norally answering the questions in this section.\n\nReflection, expression of individual opinion and deeper\nunderstanding of the text can occur later, when the text\nhas been read and understood in its totality, in the section\nThinking about the Text. The questions in the latter\nsection are designed to enable the learner to move from\nfactual understanding to critical thinking.\n\nThinking about Language provides exercises or tasks\nthat follow naturally from the contexts suggested by a\nparticular unit, for enrichment of vocabulary and other\nlanguage skills. Exploit them well and also create your\nown activities. Exercises for the communicative skills of\nlistening, speaking, and writing have been given in\ncontexts that support group or pair activity. A variety of\nwriting tasks have been aimed at.\n\nWhile dealing with poems, let children understand and\nenjoy the theme and the language by reading a poem with\nclose attention, more than once, silently or along with the\nteacher or a partner. Where some information has been\nprovided about the poet or the background to the poem,\nthis should not stand in the way of the learner accessing\nthe poem directly, and attempting to make sense of it.\nHow do we read poetry? Here is what one teacher says.\n\nAll poetry requires patience. Be patient with the text;\nread carefully for nuance and inference. Know what the\nwords mean. Look up words that are unfamiliar — look\nup words that are familiar but you cannot specify. Pay\nattention to words or phrases that resonate with other\nthings you know and try to identify the connection. Be\npatient and read slowly, and you will be amply rewarded.\n\nEach unit includes some guidelines for your assistance,\nunder the head In This Lesson, organised under two\nsubsections — What We Have Done, and What You Can\nDo. The first subsection summarises the theme of the unit,\nand/or its activities. The second suggests interesting\npossibilities for you to go beyond the text, using the text as\na springboard for a variety of language activities appropriate\nto your particular group of learners. Suggested here, for\nexample, are group activities for speaking or making a ticket\ncollage, as well as dictation. As you follow these suggestions\nand take these activities forward along your own lines, you\nwill be able to enrich your students’ learning.\n\nvi\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nTextbook Development Committee\n\nCHAIRPERSON, ADVISORY GROUP IN LANGUAGES\nProfessor Namwar Singh, formerly Chairman, School of\nLanguages, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi\nCuter ADVISOR\n\nR.

        "text": "Loreword\n\nTHe National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005,\nrecommends that children’s life at school must be linked\nto their life outside the school. This principle marks a\ndeparture from the legacy of bookish learning which\ncontinues to shape our system and causes a gap between\nthe school, home and community. The syllabi and\ntextbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt\nto implement this basic idea. They also attempt to\ndiscourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these\nmeasures will take us significantly further in the direction\nof a child-centered system of education outlined in the\nNational Policy of Education (1986).\n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that\nschool principals and teachers will take to encourage\nchildren to reflect on their own learning and to pursue\nimaginative activities and questions. We must recognise\nthat, given space, time and freedom, children generate new\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to\nthem by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the\nsole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why\nother resources and sites of learning are ignored.\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive\nand treat children as participants in learning, not as\nreceivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\n\nThese aims imply considerable change in school\nroutines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily\ntime-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the\nannual calendar so that the required number of teaching\ndays are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used\nfor teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective\nthis textbook proves for making children’s life at school a\nhappy experience, rather than a source of stress or\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the\nproblem of curricular burden by restructuring and\nreorienting knowledge at different stages with greater\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

The English curriculum lays emphasis on\nproviding a variety of rich, comprehensible inputs to\nlearners to enable their engagement in learning; and\non recognising the multilinguality of everyday\nexperience in India. This textbook aims at helping the\nlearner to read for meaning in context, thus providing\na bank of language to serve as a base for\ncommunication in English.\n\ne This book presents you with texts in a variety of\ngenres, including the diary, the formal address, the\ntravelogue, and the play, on literary, cultural and\nsociological themes that touch upon aspects of life\nrelevant to adolescents. Questions and ideas about\nthe individual and society, the understanding and\nmanagement of one’s emotions, and of one’s place\nin a larger time and space, are here presented both\nby such voices from contemporary history as Nelson\nMandela and Anne Frank, and in fiction from India\nand abroad, chosen for their enduring value. There\nare units that present glimpses of our country, and\ndepict our relationship with the natural world.\n\ne The units in the book have been loosely structured\nin the following way. An introductory section, Before\nYou Read, gives information or activates knowledge\nabout the text to be read, and suggests some warm-\nup activities. Let children participate in these to the\nfullest extent; where necessary or possible, add some\nactivities of your own.\n\ne An innovation made in consultation with teachers is a\nwhile-reading activity, the Oral Comprehension Check,\nwhich aims at a quick, ongoing check that learners are\nindeed following the text up to that point, so that they\ncan progress meaningfully to the parts of the text that\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

Let learners briefly share their understanding by\norally answering the questions in this section.\n\nReflection, expression of individual opinion and deeper\nunderstanding of the text can occur later, when the text\nhas been read and understood in its totality, in the section\nThinking about the Text. The questions in the latter\nsection are designed to enable the learner to move from\nfactual understanding to critical thinking.\n\nThinking about Language provides exercises or tasks\nthat follow naturally from the contexts suggested by a\nparticular unit, for enrichment of vocabulary and other\nlanguage skills. Exploit them well and also create your\nown activities. Exercises for the communicative skills of\nlistening, speaking, and writing have been given in\ncontexts that support group or pair activity. A variety of\nwriting tasks have been aimed at.\n\nWhile dealing with poems, let children understand and\nenjoy the theme and the language by reading a poem with\nclose attention, more than once, silently or along with the\nteacher or a partner. Where some information has been\nprovided about the poet or the background to the poem,\nthis should not stand in the way of the learner accessing\nthe poem directly, and attempting to make sense of it.\nHow do we read poetry? Here is what one teacher says.\n\nAll poetry requires patience. Be patient with the text;\nread carefully for nuance and inference. Know what the\nwords mean. Look up words that are unfamiliar — look\nup words that are familiar but you cannot specify. Pay\nattention to words or phrases that resonate with other\nthings you know and try to identify the connection. Be\npatient and read slowly, and you will be amply rewarded.\n\nEach unit includes some guidelines for your assistance,\nunder the head In This Lesson, organised under two\nsubsections — What We Have Done, and What You Can\nDo. The first subsection summarises the theme of the unit,\nand/or its activities. The second suggests interesting\npossibilities for you to go beyond the text, using the text as\na springboard for a variety of language activities appropriate\nto your particular group of learners. Suggested here, for\nexample, are group activities for speaking or making a ticket\ncollage, as well as dictation. As you follow these suggestions\nand take these activities forward along your own lines, you\nwill be able to enrich your students’ learning.\n\nvi\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",
