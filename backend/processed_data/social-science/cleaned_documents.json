If the present trend of\nresource depletion by a few individuals and\ncountries continues, the future of our planet\nis in danger.\n\nTherefore, resource planning is essential for\nsustainable existence of all forms of life.\nSustainable existence is a component of\nsustainable development.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\n(YA oO\n\neo\nSustainable development 4\n\nSustainable economic development means\n‘development should take place without\ndamaging the environment, and development\nin the present should not compromise with the\nneeds of the future generations.’\n\nRio de Janeiro Earth Summit, 1992\n\nIn June 1992, more than 100 heads of states\nmet in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, for the first\nInternational Earth Summit. The Summit was\nconvened for addressing urgent problems of\nenvironmental protection and socio-\neconomic development at the global level.\nThe assembled leaders signed the\nDeclaration on Global Climatic Change and\nBiological Diversity. The Rio Convention\nendorsed the global Forest Principles and\nadopted Agenda 21 for achieving\nSustainable Development in the 21* century.\n\nAgenda 21\n\nIt is the declaration signed by world leaders\nin 1992 at the United Nations Conference\non Environment and Development (UNCED),\nwhich took place at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It\naims at achieving global sustainable\ndevelopment.

It has importance\nin a country like India, which has enormous\ndiversity in the availability of resources. There\nare regions which are rich in certain types of\nresources but are deficient in some other\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nresources. There are some regions which can\nbe considered self sufficient in terms of the\navailability of resources and there are some\nregions which have acute shortage of some vital\nresources. For example, the states of\nJharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya\nPradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits.\nArunachal Pradesh has abundance of water\nresources but lacks in infrastructural\ndevelopment. The state of Rajasthan is very well\nendowed with solar and wind energy but lacks\nin water resources. The cold desert of Ladakh\nis relatively isolated from the rest of the\ncountry. It has very rich cultural heritage but\nit is deficient in water, infrastructure and some\nvital minerals. This calls for balanced resource\nplanning at the national, state, regional and\nlocal levels.\n\nActivity\n\nPrepare a list of resources found in your state\nand also identify the resources that are\nimportant but deficit in your state.\n\nResource Planning in India\n\nResource planning is a complex process\nwhich involves : (i) identification and\ninventory of resources across the regions of\nthe country. This involves surveying,\nmapping and qualitative and quantitative\nestimation and measurement of the\nresources. (ii) Evolving a planning structure\nendowed with appropriate technology, skill\nand institutional set up for implementing\nresource development plans. (iii) Matching\nthe resource development plans with overall\nnational development plans.\n\nIndia has made concerted efforts for\nachieving the goals of resource planning right\nfrom the First Five Year Plan launched after\nIndependence.\n\nThe availability of resources is a necessary\ncondition for the development of any region,\nbut mere availability of resources in the\nabsence of corresponding changes in\n\nFind out\n\nWhat resources are being developed in your\nsurroundings by the community/village\npanchayats/ward level communities with the\nhelp of community participation?\n\ntechnology and institutions may hinder\ndevelopment. There are many regions in our\ncountry that are rich in resources but these\nare included in economically backward\nregions. On the contrary there are some regions\nwhich have a poor resource base but they are\neconomically developed.\n\nCan you name some resource rich but\neconomically backward regions and some\nresource poor but economically developed\nregions? Give reasons for such a situation.\n\nThe history of colonisation reveals that\nrich resources in colonies were the main\nattractions for the foreign invaders. It was\nprimarily the higher level of technological\ndevelopment of the colonising countries that\nhelped them to exploit resources of other\nregions and establish their supremacy over\nthe colonies. Therefore, resources can\ncontribute to development only when they are\naccompanied by appropriate technological\ndevelopment and institutional changes. India\nhas experienced all this in different phases of\ncolonisation. Therefore, in India, development,\nin general, and resource development in\nparticular does not only involve the\navailability of resources, but also the\ntechnology, quality of human resources and\nthe historical experiences of the people.\n\nConservation of Resources: Resources are\nvital for any developmental activity. But\nirrational consumption and over-utilisation\nof resources may lead to socio-economic and\nenvironmental problems. To overcome these\nproblems, resource conservation at various\nlevels is important. This had been the main\nconcern of the leaders and thinkers in the\npast. For example, Gandhiji was very apt in\nvoicing his concern about resource ~\nconservation in these words: “There is enough\n\nRESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nfor everybody’s need and not for any body’s\ngreed.” He placed the greedy and selfish\nindividuals and exploitative nature of modern\ntechnology as the root cause for resource\ndepletion at the global level. He was against\nmass production and wanted to replace it with\nthe production by the masses.\n\n]\n\nAt the international level, the Club of Rome \\\nadvocated resource conservation for the first —\ntime in a more systematic way in 1968.\nSubsequently, in 1974, Gandhian philosophy\nwas once again presented by Schumacher\nin his book Small is Beautiful. The seminal\ncontribution with respect to resource\nconservation at the global level was made\nby the Brundtland Commission Report, 1987.\nThis report introduced the concept of\n‘Sustainable Development’ and advocated\nit as a means for resource conservation,\nwhich was subsequently published in a book\nentitled Our Common Future. Another\n\nsignificant contribution was made at the Earth\nSummit at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992.\nLAND RESOURCES\n\nWe live on land, we perform our economic\nactivities on land and we use it in different\nways. Thus, land is a natural resource of\nutmost importance. It supports natural\nvegetation, wild life, human life, economic\nactivities, transport and communication\nsystems. However, land is an asset of a finite\nmagnitude, therefore, it is important to use the\n\n[] Plains\n[| Mountains\n\n[ ] Plateaus\n\n30%\n\nFig 1.3: India : Land under important Relief\nFeatures\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\navailable land for various purposes with careful\nplanning.\n\nIndia has land under a variety of relief\nfeatures, namely; mountains, plateaus, plains\nand islands. About 43 per cent of the land area\nis plain, which provides facilities for agriculture\nand industry. Mountains account for 30 per\ncent of the total surface area of the country and\nensure perennial flow of some rivers, provide\nfacilities for tourism and ecological aspects.\nAbout 27 per cent of the area of the country is\nthe plateau region. It possesses rich reserves\nof minerals, fossil fuels and forests.\n\nLanbD UTILISATION\n\nLand resources are used for the following\npurposes:\n\n1. Forests\n\n2.

Land use data, however, is\navailable only for 93 per cent of the total\ngeographical area because the land use\nreporting for most of the north-east states\nexcept Assam has not been done fully.\nMoreover, some areas of Jammu and Kashmir\noccupied by Pakistan and China have also not\nbeen surveyed.\n\nActivity\nTry to do a comparison between the two pie\ncharts (Fig. 1.4 ) given for land use and find\nout why the net sown area and the land\nunder forests have changed from 1960-61\nto 2019-20 very marginally.\n\nThe land under permanent pasture has\nalso decreased.

A part\nof the land is termed as waste land and land\nput to other non-agricultural uses. Waste land\nincludes rocky, arid and desert areas and land\nput to other non-agricultural uses includes\nsettlements, roads, railways, industry etc.\nContinuous use of land over a long period of\ntime without taking appropriate measures to\nconserve and manage it, has resulted in land\ndegradation. This, in turn, has serious\nrepercussions on _ society and the\nenvironment.\n\nLAND DEGRADATION AND CONSERVATION\nMEASURES\n\nWe have shared our land with the past\ngenerations and will have to do so with the future\ngenerations too. Ninety-five per cent of our basic\nneeds for food, shelter and clothing are obtained\nfrom land. Human activities have not only\nbrought about degradation of land but have\nalso aggravated the pace of natural forces to\ncause damage to land.\n\nSome human activities such as\ndeforestation, over grazing, mining and\nquarrying too have contributed significantly in\nland degradation.\n\nMining sites are abandoned after\nexcavation work is complete leaving deep\nscars and traces of over-burdening. In states\nlike Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya\nPradesh and Odisha deforestation due to\nmining have caused severe land degradation.\nIn states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya\nPradesh and Maharashtra overgrazing is one\nof the main reasons for land degradation. In\nthe states of Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar\nPradesh, over irrigation is responsible for land\ndegradation due to water logging leading to\nincrease in salinity and alkalinity in the soil.\nThe mineral processing like grinding of\nlimestone for cement industry and calcite and\nsoapstone for ceramic industry generate huge\nquantity of dust in the atmosphere. It retards\nthe process of infiltration of water into the soil\nafter it settles down on the land. In recent\nyears, industrial effluents as waste have\nbecome a major source of land and water\npollution in many parts of the country.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nThere are many ways to solve the problems\nof land degradation. Afforestation and proper\nmanagement of grazing can help to some extent.\nPlanting of shelter belts of plants, control on\nover grazing, stabilisation of sand dunes by\ngrowing thorny bushes are some of the\nmethods to check land degradation in arid\nareas. Proper management of waste lands,\ncontrol of mining activities, proper discharge\nand disposal of industrial effluents and wastes\nafter treatment can reduce land and water\ndegradation in industrial and suburban areas.\n\nSor as A RESOURCE\n\nSoil is the most important renewable natural\nresource. It is the medium of plant growth\nand supports different types of living organisms\non the earth. The soil is a living system. It\ntakes millions of years to form soil upto a few\ncm in depth. Relief, parent rock or bed rock,\nclimate, vegetation and other forms of life and\ntime are important factors in the formation of\nsoil. Various forces of nature such as change\nin temperature, actions of running water, wind\nand glaciers, activities of decomposers etc.\ncontribute to the formation of soil. Chemical\nand organic changes which take place in the\n\n-\\ Unweathered  « A\n\\_/ «parent bed rock\noe Sa eee ah\nam ee > =~ § a Sed\n\nFig. 1.5: Soil Profile\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nsoil are equally important. Soil also consists\nof organic (humus) and inorganic materials\n(Fig. 1.5).\n\nOn the basis of the factors responsible for\nsoil formation, colour, thickness, texture, age,\nchemical and physical properties, the soils of\nIndia are classified in different types.\n\nClassification of Soils\n\nIndia has varied relief features, landforms,\nclimatic realms and vegetation types. These\nhave contributed in the development of various\ntypes of soils.\n\nAlluvial Soils\n\nThis is the most widely spread and important\nsoil. In fact, the entire northern plains are\nmade of alluvial soil. These have been\ndeposited by three important Himalayan river\nsystems- the Indus, the Ganga and the\nBrahmaputra. These soils also extend in\nRajasthan and Gujarat through a narrow\ncorridor. Alluvial soil is also found in the\n\neastern coastal plains particularly in the deltas\nof the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna\nand the Kaveri rivers.\n\nFig. 1.6: Alluvial Soil\n\nThe alluvial soil consists of various\nproportions of sand, silt and clay. As we move\ninlands towards the river valleys, soil particles\nappear some what bigger in size. In the upper\nreaches of the river valley i.e. near the place\nof the break of slope, the soils are coarse. Such\nsoils are more common in piedmont plains\nsuch as Duars, Chos and Terai.\n\nApart from the size of their grains or\ncomponents, soils are also described on the\nbasis of their age. According to their age\nalluvial soils can be classified as old alluvial\n(Bangar) and new alluvial (Khadar). The\nbangar soil has higher concentration of kanker\n\nnodules than the Khadar. It has more fine\nparticles and is more fertile than the bangar.\n\nAlluvial soils as a whole are very fertile.\nMostly these soils contain adequate proportion\nof potash, phosphoric acid and lime which\nare ideal for the growth of sugarcane, paddy,\nwheat and other cereal and pulse crops. Due\nto its high fertility, regions of alluvial soils are\nintensively cultivated and densely populated.\nSoils in the drier areas are more alkaline and\ncan be productive after proper treatment and\nirrigation.\n\nBlack Soil\n\nThese soils are black in colour and are also\nknown as regur soils. Black soil is ideal for\ngrowing cotton and is also known as black\ncotton soil. It is believed that climatic condition\nalong with the parent rock material are the\nimportant factors for the formation of black\nsoil. This type of soil is typical of the Deccan\ntrap (Basalt) region spread over northwest\nDeccan plateau and is made up of lava flows.\nThey cover the plateaus of Maharashtra,\nSaurashtra, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh and\nChhattisgarh and extend in the south east\ndirection along the Godavari and the Krishna\nvalleys.\n\nFig. 1.7: Black Soil\n\nThe black soils are made up of extremely\nfine i.e. clayey material. They are well-known\nfor their capacity to hold moisture. In addition,\n\nthey are rich in soil nutrients, such as calcium ¥\n\ncarbonate, magnesium, potash and lime.

Yellow\nand red soils are also found in parts of\nOdisha, Chhattisgarh, southern parts of the\nmiddle Ganga plain and along the piedmont\nzone of the Western Ghats. These soils develop\na reddish colour due to diffusion of iron in\ncrystalline and metamorphic rocks. It looks\nyellow when it occurs in a hydrated form.\n\nLaterite Soil\n\nLaterite has been derived from the Latin word\n‘later’ which means brick. The laterite soil\ndevelops under tropical and subtropical\nclimate with alternate wet and dry season.\nThis soil is the result of intense leaching due\nto heavy rain. Lateritic soils are mostly deep\nto very deep, acidic (pH<6.0), generally\ndeficient in plant nutrients and occur mostly\nin southern states, Western Ghats region of\nMaharashtra, Odisha, some parts of West\nBengal and North-east regions. Where these\nsoils support deciduous and evergreen\nforests, it is humus rich, but under sparse\n\nFig. 1.8: Laterite Soil\n\nvegetation and in semi-arid environment, it is\ngenerally humus poor. They are prone to\nerosion and degradation due to their position\non the landscape. After adopting appropriate\nsoil conservation techniques particularly in\nthe hilly areas of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil\nNadu, this soil is very useful for growing tea\nand coffee. Red laterite soils in Tamil Nadu,\nAndhra Pradesh and Kerala are more suitable\nfor crops like cashew nut.\n\nArid Soils\n\nArid soils range from red to brown in colour.\nThey are generally sandy in texture and saline\nin nature. In some areas the salt content is\nvery high and common salt is obtained by\nevaporating the water. Due to the dry climate,\nhigh temperature, evaporation is faster and\nthe soil lacks humus and moisture. The lower\nhorizons of the soil are occupied by Kankar\nbecause of the increasing calcium content\ndownwards. The Kankar layer formations in\nthe bottom horizons restrict the infiltration of\nwater. After proper irrigation these soils\nbecome cultivable as has been in the case of\nwestern Rajasthan.\n\nFig. 1.9: Arid Soil\n\nForest Soils\n\nThese soils are found in the hilly and\nmountainous areas where sufficient rain\nforests are available. The soils texture varies\naccording to the mountain environment\nwhere they are formed. They are loamy and\n\nsilty in valley sides and coarse grained in\n\nthe upper slopes. In the snow covered areas\n\nRESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nof Himalayas, these soils experience\ndenudation and are acidic with low humus\ncontent. The soils found in the lower parts of\nthe valleys particularly on the river terraces\nand alluvial fans are fertile.\n\nSoil Erosion and Soil Conservation\n\nThe denudation of the soil cover and\nsubsequent washing down is described as soil\nerosion. The processes of soil formation and\nerosion, go on simultaneously and generally\nthere is a balance between the two. Sometimes,\nthis balance is disturbed due to human\nactivities like deforestation, over-grazing,\nconstruction and mining etc., while natural\nforces like wind, glacier and water lead to\nsoil erosion. The running water cuts through\nthe clayey soils and makes deep channels as\ngullies. The land becomes unfit for cultivation\nand is known as bad land. In the Chambal\n\nbasin such lands are called ravines.\nSometimes water flows as a sheet over large\nareas down a slope. In such cases the top\n\nFig. 1.10: Soil Erosion\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig. 1.11: Gully Erosion\n\nsoil is washed away. This is known as sheet\nerosion. Wind blows loose soil off flat or\nsloping land known as wind erosion. Soil\nerosion is also caused due to defective methods\nof farming. Ploughing in a wrong way i.e. up\nand down the slope form channels for the\nquick flow of water leading to soil erosion.\n\nPloughing along the contour lines can\ndecelerate the flow of water down the slopes.\nThis is called contour ploughing. Steps can\nbe cut out on the slopes making terraces.\nTerrace cultivation restricts erosion. Western\nand central Himalayas have well developed\nterrace farming. Large fields can be divided into\nstrips. Strips of grass are left to grow between\nthe crops. This breaks up the force of the wind.\nThis method is known as strip cropping.\nPlanting lines of trees to create shelter also\nworks in a similar way. Rows of such trees are\ncalled shelter belts. These shelter belts have\ncontributed significantly to the stabilisation of\nsand dunes and in stabilising the desert in\nwestern India.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nExercises EXERCISES Exercises\n\n1.

It was believed that resources are free gifts of nature. As a result, human beings used them indiscriminately and this has led to the following major problems. e Depletion of resources for satisfying the greed of a few individuals. e Accumulation ofresources in few hands, which, in turn, divided the society into two segments i.e. haves and have nots or rich and poor. e Indiscriminate exploitation of resources has led to global ecological crises such as, global warming, ozone layer depletion, environmental pollution and land degradation. Activity 1. Imagine, if the oil supply gets exhausted one day, how would this affect our life style? 2. Plan a survey in your colony/village to I investigate people’s attitude towards recycling of the domestic/agricultural wastes. Ask questions about : (a) What do they think about resources they use? (b) What is their opinion about the I wastes, and its utilisation? (c) Collage your results. An equitable distribution of resources has become essential for a sustained quality of life and global peace. If the present trend of resource depletion by a few individuals and countries continues, the future of our planet is in danger. Therefore, resource planning is essential for sustainable existence of all forms of life. Sustainable existence is a component of sustainable development. CONTEMPORARY INDIA — II (YA oO eo Sustainable development 4 Sustainable economic development means ‘development should take place without damaging the environment, and development in the present should not compromise with the needs of the future generations.’ Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, 1992 In June 1992, more than 1OO heads of states met in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, for the first International Earth Summit. The Summit was convened for addressing urgent problems of environmental protection and socio- economic development at the global level. The assembled leaders signed the Declaration on Global Climatic Change and Biological Diversity. The Rio Convention endorsed the global Forest Principles and adopted Agenda 21 for achieving Sustainable Development in the 21* century. Agenda 21 It is the declaration signed by world leaders in 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), which took place at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It aims at achieving global sustainable development. It is an agenda to combat environmental damage, poverty, disease through global co-operation on common interests, mutual needs and shared - responsibilities. One major objective of the should draw its own local Agenda 21. 5 Agenda 21 is that every local government RESOURCE PLANNING Planning is the widely accepted strategy for judicious use of resources. It has importance in a country like India, which has enormous diversity in the availability of resources. There are regions which are rich in certain types of resources but are deficient in some other Reprint 2O25-26 resources. There are some regions which can be considered self sufficient in terms of the availability of resources and there are some regions which have acute shortage of some vital resources. For example, the states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits. Arunachal Pradesh has abundance of water resources but lacks in infrastructural development. The state of Rajasthan is very well endowed with solar and wind energy but lacks in water resources. The cold desert of Ladakh is relatively isolated from the rest of the country. It has very rich cultural heritage but it is deficient in water, infrastructure and some vital minerals. This calls for balanced resource planning at the national, state, regional and local levels. Activity Prepare a list of resources found in your state and also identify the resources that are important but deficit in your state. Resource Planning in India Resource planning is a complex process which involves : (i) identification and inventory of resources across the regions of the country. This involves surveying, mapping and qualitative and quantitative estimation and measurement of the resources. (ii) Evolving a planning structure endowed with appropriate technology, skill and institutional set up for implementing resource development plans. (iii) Matching the resource development plans with overall national development plans. India has made concerted efforts for achieving the goals of resource planning right from the First Five Year Plan launched after Independence. The availability of resources is a necessary condition for the development of any region, but mere availability of resources in the absence of corresponding changes in Find out What resources are being developed in your surroundings by the community/village panchayats/ward level communities with the help of community participation? technology and institutions may hinder development. There are many regions in our country that are rich in resources but these are included in economically backward regions. On the contrary there are some regions which have a poor resource base but they are economically developed. Can you name some resource rich but economically backward regions and some resource poor but economically developed regions? Give reasons for such a situation. The history of colonisation reveals that rich resources in colonies were the main attractions for the foreign invaders. It was primarily the higher level of technological development of the colonising countries that helped them to exploit resources of other regions and establish their supremacy over the colonies. Therefore, resources can contribute to development only when they are accompanied by appropriate technological development and institutional changes. India has experienced all this in different phases of colonisation. Therefore, in India, development, in general, and resource development in particular does not only involve the availability of resources, but also the technology, quality of human resources and the historical experiences of the people. Conservation of Resources: Resources are vital for any developmental activity. But irrational consumption and over-utilisation of resources may lead to socio-economic and environmental problems. To overcome these problems, resource conservation at various levels is important. This had been the main concern of the leaders and thinkers in the past. For example, Gandhiji was very apt in voicing his concern about resource ~ conservation in these words: “There is enough RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT Reprint 2O25-26 for everybody’s need and not for any body’s greed.” He placed the greedy and selfish individuals and exploitative nature of modern technology as the root cause for resource depletion at the global level. He was against mass production and wanted to replace it with the production by the masses. ] At the international level, the Club of Rome \\ advocated resource conservation for the first — time in a more systematic way in 1968. Subsequently, in 1974, Gandhian philosophy was once again presented by Schumacher in his book Small is Beautiful. The seminal contribution with respect to resource conservation at the global level was made by the Brundtland Commission Report, 1987. This report introduced the concept of ‘Sustainable Development’ and advocated it as a means for resource conservation, which was subsequently published in a book entitled Our Common Future. Another significant contribution was made at the Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992. LAND RESOURCES We live on land, we perform our economic activities on land and we use it in different ways. Thus, land is a natural resource of utmost importance. It supports natural vegetation, wild life, human life, economic activities, transport and communication systems. However, land is an asset of a finite magnitude, therefore, it is important to use the Plains [I Mountains Plateaus 3O% Fig 1.3: India : Land under important Relief Features CONTEMPORARY INDIA — II available land for various purposes with careful planning. India has land under a variety of relief features, namely; mountains, plateaus, plains and islands. About 43 per cent of the land area is plain, which provides facilities for agriculture and industry. Mountains account for 3O per cent of the total surface area of the country and ensure perennial flow of some rivers, provide facilities for tourism and ecological aspects. About 27 per cent of the area of the country is the plateau region. It possesses rich reserves of minerals, fossil fuels and forests. LanbD UTILISATION Land resources are used for the following purposes: 1. Forests 2. Land not available for cultivation (a) Barren and waste land (b) Land put to non-agricultural uses, e.g. buildings, roads, factories, etc. 3. Other uncultivated land (excluding fallow land) (a) Permanent pastures and grazing land, (b) Land under miscellaneous tree crops groves (not included in net sown area), (c) Culturable waste land (left uncultivated for more than 5 agricultural years). 4. Fallow lands (a) Current fallow-(left without cultivation for one or less than one agricultural year), (b) Other than current fallow-(left uncultivated for the past 1 to 5 agricultural years). 5. Net sown area- the physical extent of land on which crops are sown harvested is known as net sown area. Area sown more than once in an agricultural year plus net sown area is known as gross cropped area. LanpbD USE PatTTeRN IN INDIA The use of land is determined both by physical factors such as topography, climate, soil types as well as human factors such as population density, technological capability and culture and traditions etc. Reprint 2O25-26 General land use categories—196O-61 General land use categories— 2O19-2O Reporting Area: 1OO Per cent 18.11% 6.23% 3.73% 3.5O% @ Forest @ Barren and unculturable waste land @ Area under non-agricultural uses M@ Permanent pasture and grazing land @ Area under misc. tree crops and groves @ Culturable waste land {§) Fallow other than current fallow ®@ Current fallow .

The land under permanent pasture has also decreased. How are we able to feed our huge cattle population on this pasture land and what are the consequences of it? Most of the other than the current fallow lands are either of poor quality or the cost of cultivation p 4 of such land is very high. Hence, these lands are cultivated once or twice in about two to three years and if these are included in the net sown area then the percentage of NSA in India comes to about 54 per cent of the total reporting area. The pattern of net sown area varies greatly from one state to another. It is over 8O per cent of the total area in Punjab and Haryana and less than 1O per cent in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Manipur and Andaman Nicobar Islands. e é ce) Find out reasons for the low proportion of / net sown area in these states. Forest area in the country is far lower than the desired 33 per cent of geographical area, as it was outlined in the National Forest Policy (1952). It was considered essential for _ maintenance of the ecological balance. The livelihood of millions of people who live on the iS RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT Reprint 2O25-26 fringes of these forests depends upon it. A part of the land is termed as waste land and land put to other non-agricultural uses. Waste land includes rocky, arid and desert areas and land put to other non-agricultural uses includes settlements, roads, railways, industry etc. Continuous use of land over a long period of time without taking appropriate measures to conserve and manage it, has resulted in land degradation. This, in turn, has serious repercussions on _ society and the environment. LAND DEGRADATION AND CONSERVATION MEASURES We have shared our land with the past generations and will have to do so with the future generations too. Ninety-five per cent of our basic needs for food, shelter and clothing are obtained from land. Human activities have not only brought about degradation of land but have also aggravated the pace of natural forces to cause damage to land. Some human activities such as deforestation, over grazing, mining and quarrying too have contributed significantly in land degradation. Mining sites are abandoned after excavation work is complete leaving deep scars and traces of over-burdening. In states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha deforestation due to mining have caused severe land degradation. In states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra overgrazing is one of the main reasons for land degradation. In the states of Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh, over irrigation is responsible for land degradation due to water logging leading to increase in salinity and alkalinity in the soil. The mineral processing like grinding of limestone for cement industry and calcite and soapstone for ceramic industry generate huge quantity of dust in the atmosphere. It retards the process of infiltration of water into the soil after it settles down on the land. In recent years, industrial effluents as waste have become a major source of land and water pollution in many parts of the country. CONTEMPORARY INDIA — II There are many ways to solve the problems of land degradation. Afforestation and proper management of grazing can help to some extent. Planting of shelter belts of plants, control on over grazing, stabilisation of sand dunes by growing thorny bushes are some of the methods to check land degradation in arid areas. Proper management of waste lands, control of mining activities, proper discharge and disposal of industrial effluents and wastes after treatment can reduce land and water degradation in industrial and suburban areas. Sor as A RESOURCE Soil is the most important renewable natural resource. It is the medium of plant growth and supports different types of living organisms on the earth. The soil is a living system. It takes millions of years to form soil upto a few cm in depth. Relief, parent rock or bed rock, climate, vegetation and other forms of life and time are important factors in the formation of soil. Various forces of nature such as change in temperature, actions of running water, wind and glaciers, activities of decomposers etc. contribute to the formation of soil. Chemical and organic changes which take place in the -\\ Unweathered « A \\_/ «parent bed rock oe Sa eee ah am ee > =~ § a Sed Fig. 1.5: Soil Profile Reprint 2O25-26 soil are equally important. Soil also consists of organic (humus) and inorganic materials (Fig. 1.5). On the basis of the factors responsible for soil formation, colour, thickness, texture, age, chemical and physical properties, the soils of India are classified in different types. Classification of Soils India has varied relief features, landforms, climatic realms and vegetation types. These have contributed in the development of various types of soils. Alluvial Soils This is the most widely spread and important soil. In fact, the entire northern plains are made of alluvial soil. These have been deposited by three important Himalayan river systems- the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra. These soils also extend in Rajasthan and Gujarat through a narrow corridor. Alluvial soil is also found in the eastern coastal plains particularly in the deltas of the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri rivers. Fig. 1.6: Alluvial Soil The alluvial soil consists of various proportions of sand, silt and clay. As we move inlands towards the river valleys, soil particles appear some what bigger in size. In the upper reaches of the river valley i.e. near the place of the break of slope, the soils are coarse. Such soils are more common in piedmont plains such as Duars, Chos and Terai. Apart from the size of their grains or components, soils are also described on the basis of their age. According to their age alluvial soils can be classified as old alluvial (Bangar) and new alluvial (Khadar). The bangar soil has higher concentration of kanker nodules than the Khadar. It has more fine particles and is more fertile than the bangar. Alluvial soils as a whole are very fertile. Mostly these soils contain adequate proportion of potash, phosphoric acid and lime which are ideal for the growth of sugarcane, paddy, wheat and other cereal and pulse crops. Due to its high fertility, regions of alluvial soils are intensively cultivated and densely populated. Soils in the drier areas are more alkaline and can be productive after proper treatment and irrigation. Black Soil These soils are black in colour and are also known as regur soils. Black soil is ideal for growing cotton and is also known as black cotton soil. It is believed that climatic condition along with the parent rock material are the important factors for the formation of black soil. This type of soil is typical of the Deccan trap (Basalt) region spread over northwest Deccan plateau and is made up of lava flows. They cover the plateaus of Maharashtra, Saurashtra, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and extend in the south east direction along the Godavari and the Krishna valleys. Fig. 1.7: Black Soil The black soils are made up of extremely fine i.e. clayey material. They are well-known for their capacity to hold moisture. In addition, they are rich in soil nutrients, such as calcium ¥ carbonate, magnesium, potash and lime.

(INDIA) (INDIA) ° “ f 6OO km oe . : > 8°N INDIAN OCEAN 84° India: Major Soil Types CONTEMPORARY INDIA — Il Reprint 2O25-26 soils are generally poor in phosphoric contents. They develop deep cracks during hot weather, which helps in the proper aeration of the soil. These soils are sticky when wet and difficult to work on unless tilled immediately after the first shower or during the pre-monsoon period. Red and Yellow Soils Red soil develops on crystalline igneous rocks in areas of low rainfall in the eastern and southern parts of the Deccan plateau. Yellow and red soils are also found in parts of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, southern parts of the middle Ganga plain and along the piedmont zone of the Western Ghats. These soils develop a reddish colour due to diffusion of iron in crystalline and metamorphic rocks. It looks yellow when it occurs in a hydrated form. Laterite Soil Laterite has been derived from the Latin word ‘later’ which means brick. The laterite soil develops under tropical and subtropical climate with alternate wet and dry season. This soil is the result of intense leaching due to heavy rain. Lateritic soils are mostly deep to very deep, acidic (pH<6.O), generally deficient in plant nutrients and occur mostly in southern states, Western Ghats region of Maharashtra, Odisha, some parts of West Bengal and North-east regions. Where these soils support deciduous and evergreen forests, it is humus rich, but under sparse Fig. 1.8: Laterite Soil vegetation and in semi-arid environment, it is generally humus poor. They are prone to erosion and degradation due to their position on the landscape. After adopting appropriate soil conservation techniques particularly in the hilly areas of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, this soil is very useful for growing tea and coffee. Red laterite soils in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala are more suitable for crops like cashew nut. Arid Soils Arid soils range from red to brown in colour. They are generally sandy in texture and saline in nature. In some areas the salt content is very high and common salt is obtained by evaporating the water. Due to the dry climate, high temperature, evaporation is faster and the soil lacks humus and moisture. The lower horizons of the soil are occupied by Kankar because of the increasing calcium content downwards. The Kankar layer formations in the bottom horizons restrict the infiltration of water. After proper irrigation these soils become cultivable as has been in the case of western Rajasthan. Fig. 1.9: Arid Soil Forest Soils These soils are found in the hilly and mountainous areas where sufficient rain forests are available. The soils texture varies according to the mountain environment where they are formed. They are loamy and silty in valley sides and coarse grained in the upper slopes. In the snow covered areas RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT Reprint 2O25-26 of Himalayas, these soils experience denudation and are acidic with low humus content. The soils found in the lower parts of the valleys particularly on the river terraces and alluvial fans are fertile. Soil Erosion and Soil Conservation The denudation of the soil cover and subsequent washing down is described as soil erosion. The processes of soil formation and erosion, go on simultaneously and generally there is a balance between the two. Sometimes, this balance is disturbed due to human activities like deforestation, over-grazing, construction and mining etc., while natural forces like wind, glacier and water lead to soil erosion. The running water cuts through the clayey soils and makes deep channels as gullies. The land becomes unfit for cultivation and is known as bad land. In the Chambal basin such lands are called ravines. Sometimes water flows as a sheet over large areas down a slope. In such cases the top Fig. 1.1O: Soil Erosion CONTEMPORARY INDIA — II Fig. 1.11: Gully Erosion soil is washed away. This is known as sheet erosion. Wind blows loose soil off flat or sloping land known as wind erosion. Soil erosion is also caused due to defective methods of farming. Ploughing in a wrong way i.e. up and down the slope form channels for the quick flow of water leading to soil erosion. Ploughing along the contour lines can decelerate the flow of water down the slopes. This is called contour ploughing. Steps can be cut out on the slopes making terraces. Terrace cultivation restricts erosion. Western and central Himalayas have well developed terrace farming. Large fields can be divided into strips. Strips of grass are left to grow between the crops. This breaks up the force of the wind. This method is known as strip cropping. Planting lines of trees to create shelter also works in a similar way. Rows of such trees are called shelter belts. These shelter belts have contributed significantly to the stabilisation of sand dunes and in stabilising the desert in western India. Reprint 2O25-26 Exercises EXERCISES Exercises 1.

Waste land\nincludes rocky, arid and desert areas and land\nput to other non-agricultural uses includes\nsettlements, roads, railways, industry etc.\nContinuous use of land over a long period of\ntime without taking appropriate measures to\nconserve and manage it, has resulted in land\ndegradation. This, in turn, has serious\nrepercussions on _ society and the\nenvironment.\n\nLAND DEGRADATION AND CONSERVATION\nMEASURES\n\nWe have shared our land with the past\ngenerations and will have to do so with the future\ngenerations too. Ninety-five per cent of our basic\nneeds for food, shelter and clothing are obtained\nfrom land. Human activities have not only\nbrought about degradation of land but have\nalso aggravated the pace of natural forces to\ncause damage to land.\n\nSome human activities such as\ndeforestation, over grazing, mining and\nquarrying too have contributed significantly in\nland degradation.\n\nMining sites are abandoned after\nexcavation work is complete leaving deep\nscars and traces of over-burdening. In states\nlike Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya\nPradesh and Odisha deforestation due to\nmining have caused severe land degradation.\nIn states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya\nPradesh and Maharashtra overgrazing is one\nof the main reasons for land degradation. In\nthe states of Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar\nPradesh, over irrigation is responsible for land\ndegradation due to water logging leading to\nincrease in salinity and alkalinity in the soil.\nThe mineral processing like grinding of\nlimestone for cement industry and calcite and\nsoapstone for ceramic industry generate huge\nquantity of dust in the atmosphere. It retards\nthe process of infiltration of water into the soil\nafter it settles down on the land. In recent\nyears, industrial effluents as waste have\nbecome a major source of land and water\npollution in many parts of the country.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nThere are many ways to solve the problems\nof land degradation. Afforestation and proper\nmanagement of grazing can help to some extent.\nPlanting of shelter belts of plants, control on\nover grazing, stabilisation of sand dunes by\ngrowing thorny bushes are some of the\nmethods to check land degradation in arid\nareas. Proper management of waste lands,\ncontrol of mining activities, proper discharge\nand disposal of industrial effluents and wastes\nafter treatment can reduce land and water\ndegradation in industrial and suburban areas.\n\nSor as A RESOURCE\n\nSoil is the most important renewable natural\nresource. It is the medium of plant growth\nand supports different types of living organisms\non the earth. The soil is a living system. It\ntakes millions of years to form soil upto a few\ncm in depth. Relief, parent rock or bed rock,\nclimate, vegetation and other forms of life and\ntime are important factors in the formation of\nsoil.

Soil also consists\nof organic (humus) and inorganic materials\n(Fig. 1.5).\n\nOn the basis of the factors responsible for\nsoil formation, colour, thickness, texture, age,\nchemical and physical properties, the soils of\nIndia are classified in different types.\n\nClassification of Soils\n\nIndia has varied relief features, landforms,\nclimatic realms and vegetation types. These\nhave contributed in the development of various\ntypes of soils.\n\nAlluvial Soils\n\nThis is the most widely spread and important\nsoil. In fact, the entire northern plains are\nmade of alluvial soil. These have been\ndeposited by three important Himalayan river\nsystems- the Indus, the Ganga and the\nBrahmaputra. These soils also extend in\nRajasthan and Gujarat through a narrow\ncorridor. Alluvial soil is also found in the\n\neastern coastal plains particularly in the deltas\nof the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna\nand the Kaveri rivers.\n\nFig. 1.6: Alluvial Soil\n\nThe alluvial soil consists of various\nproportions of sand, silt and clay. As we move\ninlands towards the river valleys, soil particles\nappear some what bigger in size. In the upper\nreaches of the river valley i.e. near the place\nof the break of slope, the soils are coarse. Such\nsoils are more common in piedmont plains\nsuch as Duars, Chos and Terai.\n\nApart from the size of their grains or\ncomponents, soils are also described on the\nbasis of their age. According to their age\nalluvial soils can be classified as old alluvial\n(Bangar) and new alluvial (Khadar). The\nbangar soil has higher concentration of kanker\n\nnodules than the Khadar. It has more fine\nparticles and is more fertile than the bangar.\n\nAlluvial soils as a whole are very fertile.\nMostly these soils contain adequate proportion\nof potash, phosphoric acid and lime which\nare ideal for the growth of sugarcane, paddy,\nwheat and other cereal and pulse crops. Due\nto its high fertility, regions of alluvial soils are\nintensively cultivated and densely populated.\nSoils in the drier areas are more alkaline and\ncan be productive after proper treatment and\nirrigation.\n\nBlack Soil\n\nThese soils are black in colour and are also\nknown as regur soils. Black soil is ideal for\ngrowing cotton and is also known as black\ncotton soil. It is believed that climatic condition\nalong with the parent rock material are the\nimportant factors for the formation of black\nsoil. This type of soil is typical of the Deccan\ntrap (Basalt) region spread over northwest\nDeccan plateau and is made up of lava flows.\nThey cover the plateaus of Maharashtra,\nSaurashtra, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh and\nChhattisgarh and extend in the south east\ndirection along the Godavari and the Krishna\nvalleys.\n\nFig. 1.7: Black Soil\n\nThe black soils are made up of extremely\nfine i.e. clayey material. They are well-known\nfor their capacity to hold moisture. In addition,\n\nthey are rich in soil nutrients, such as calcium ¥\n\ncarbonate, magnesium, potash and lime.

Yellow\nand red soils are also found in parts of\nOdisha, Chhattisgarh, southern parts of the\nmiddle Ganga plain and along the piedmont\nzone of the Western Ghats. These soils develop\na reddish colour due to diffusion of iron in\ncrystalline and metamorphic rocks. It looks\nyellow when it occurs in a hydrated form.\n\nLaterite Soil\n\nLaterite has been derived from the Latin word\n‘later’ which means brick. The laterite soil\ndevelops under tropical and subtropical\nclimate with alternate wet and dry season.\nThis soil is the result of intense leaching due\nto heavy rain. Lateritic soils are mostly deep\nto very deep, acidic (pH<6.0), generally\ndeficient in plant nutrients and occur mostly\nin southern states, Western Ghats region of\nMaharashtra, Odisha, some parts of West\nBengal and North-east regions.

They are prone to\nerosion and degradation due to their position\non the landscape. After adopting appropriate\nsoil conservation techniques particularly in\nthe hilly areas of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil\nNadu, this soil is very useful for growing tea\nand coffee. Red laterite soils in Tamil Nadu,\nAndhra Pradesh and Kerala are more suitable\nfor crops like cashew nut.\n\nArid Soils\n\nArid soils range from red to brown in colour.\nThey are generally sandy in texture and saline\nin nature. In some areas the salt content is\nvery high and common salt is obtained by\nevaporating the water. Due to the dry climate,\nhigh temperature, evaporation is faster and\nthe soil lacks humus and moisture. The lower\nhorizons of the soil are occupied by Kankar\nbecause of the increasing calcium content\ndownwards. The Kankar layer formations in\nthe bottom horizons restrict the infiltration of\nwater. After proper irrigation these soils\nbecome cultivable as has been in the case of\nwestern Rajasthan.\n\nFig. 1.9: Arid Soil\n\nForest Soils\n\nThese soils are found in the hilly and\nmountainous areas where sufficient rain\nforests are available.

The soils found in the lower parts of\nthe valleys particularly on the river terraces\nand alluvial fans are fertile.\n\nSoil Erosion and Soil Conservation\n\nThe denudation of the soil cover and\nsubsequent washing down is described as soil\nerosion. The processes of soil formation and\nerosion, go on simultaneously and generally\nthere is a balance between the two. Sometimes,\nthis balance is disturbed due to human\nactivities like deforestation, over-grazing,\nconstruction and mining etc., while natural\nforces like wind, glacier and water lead to\nsoil erosion. The running water cuts through\nthe clayey soils and makes deep channels as\ngullies. The land becomes unfit for cultivation\nand is known as bad land. In the Chambal\n\nbasin such lands are called ravines.\nSometimes water flows as a sheet over large\nareas down a slope. In such cases the top\n\nFig. 1.10: Soil Erosion\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig. 1.11: Gully Erosion\n\nsoil is washed away. This is known as sheet\nerosion. Wind blows loose soil off flat or\nsloping land known as wind erosion. Soil\nerosion is also caused due to defective methods\nof farming. Ploughing in a wrong way i.e. up\nand down the slope form channels for the\nquick flow of water leading to soil erosion.\n\nPloughing along the contour lines can\ndecelerate the flow of water down the slopes.\nThis is called contour ploughing. Steps can\nbe cut out on the slopes making terraces.\nTerrace cultivation restricts erosion. Western\nand central Himalayas have well developed\nterrace farming. Large fields can be divided into\nstrips. Strips of grass are left to grow between\nthe crops. This breaks up the force of the wind.\nThis method is known as strip cropping.\nPlanting lines of trees to create shelter also\nworks in a similar way. Rows of such trees are\ncalled shelter belts. These shelter belts have\ncontributed significantly to the stabilisation of\nsand dunes and in stabilising the desert in\nwestern India.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

But why do we need to\nconserve our forests and_ wildlife?\nConservation preserves the ecological diversity\nand our life support systems - water, air and\nsoil. It also preserves the genetic diversity of\nplants and animals for better growth of species\nand breeding. For example, in agriculture,\nwe are still dependent on traditional crop\nvarieties. Fisheries too are heavily dependent\non the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, conservationists\ndemanded a national wildlife protection\nprogramme.

An all-\nIndia list of protected species was also\npublished. The thrust of the programme was\ntowards protecting the remaining population\nof certain endangered species by banning\nhunting, giving legal protection to their\nhabitats, and restricting trade in wildlife.\nSubsequently, central and many state\ngovernments established national parks and\nwildlife sanctuaries about which you have\nalready studied. The central government also\nannounced several projects for protecting\nspecific animals, which were gravely\nthreatened, including the tiger, the one-\nhorned rhinoceros, the Kashmir stag or\nhangul, three types of crocodiles — fresh\nwater crocodile, saltwater crocodile and the\nGharial, the Asiatic lion, and others. Most\nrecently, the Indian elephant, black buck\n(chinkara), the great Indian bustard\n(godawan) and the snow leopard, etc. have\n\n~ been given full or partial legal protection\n\n{wv against hunting and trade throughout India.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\ntd\nProject Tiger\nTiger is one of the key wildlife species in\n\nthe faunal web. In 1973, the authorities\nrealised that the tiger population had\ndwindled to 1,827 from an estimated\n55,000 at the turn of the century. The major\nthreats to tiger population are numerous,\nsuch as poaching for trade, shrinking\nhabitat, depletion of prey base species,\ngrowing human population, etc. The trade\nof tiger skins and the use of their bones in\ntraditional medicines, especially in the\nAsian countries left the tiger population on\nthe verge of extinction. Since India and\nNepal provide habitat to about two-thirds\nof the surviving tiger population in the\nworld, these two nations became prime\ntargets for poaching and illegal trading.\n“Project Tiger”, one of the well-\npublicised wildlife campaigns in the world,\nwas launched in 1973. Tiger conservation\nhas been viewed not only as an effort to\nsave an endangered species, but with\n\n\n\nFig. 2.2: Rhino and deer in Kaziranga National Park\n\nequal importance as a means of\npreserving biotypes of sizeable magnitude.\nCorbett National Park in Uttarakhand,\nSunderbans National Park in West Bengal,\nBandhavgarh National Park in Madhya\nPradesh, Sariska Wildlife Sanctuary in\nRajasthan, Manas Tiger Reserve in Assam\n\ne . . .\nand Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala are\n} some of the tiger reserves of India.\n\nThe conservation projects are now focusing\non biodiversity rather than on a few of its\ncomponents. There is now a more intensive\nsearch for different conservation measures.\nIncreasingly, even insects are beginning to find\na place in conservation planning. In the\nnotification under Wildlife Act of 1980 and\n1986, several hundred butterflies, moths,\nbeetles, and one dragonfly have been added to\nthe list of protected species. In 1991, for the\nfirst time plants were also added to the list,\nstarting with six species.\n\n- Activity\nCollect more information on the wildlife\nsanctuaries and national parks of India and\ncite their locations on the map of India.\n\nTypes and Distribution of Forest and\nWildlife Resources\n\nEven if we want to conserve our vast forest and\nwildlife resources, it is rather difficult to\nmanage, control and regulate them. In India,\n\nmuch of its forest and wildlife resources are\neither owned or managed by the government\nthrough the Forest Department or other\ngovernment departments. These are classified\nunder the following categories.\n\n(j) Reserved Forests: More than half of the\ntotal forest land has been declared\nreserved forests.

This entire habitat that we live in has immense biodiversity. We humans along with all living organisms form a complex web of ecological system in which we are only a part and very much dependent on this system for our own existence. For example, the plants, animals and micro-organisms re-create the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the soil that produces our food without which we cannot survive. Forests play a key role in the ecological system as these are also the primary producers on which all other living beings depend. @ Biodiversity or Biological Diversity is immensely rich in wildlife and cultivated ) @ species, diverse in form and function but closely integrated in a system through multiple network of interdependencies. Flora and Fauna in India If you look around, you will be able to find that there are some animals and plants which are unique in your area. In fact, India is one of the world’s richest countries in terms of its vast array of biological diversity. This is possibly twice or thrice the number yet to be discovered. You have already studied in detail about the extent and variety of forest and wildlife resources in India. You may have realised the importance of these resources in our daily life. These diverse flora and fauna are so well integrated in our daily life that we take these for granted. But, lately, they are under great stress mainy due to insensitivity to our environment. Activity —— Find out stories prevalent in your region which are about the harmonious relationship between human beings and nature. Conservation of Forest and Wildlife in India Conservation in the background of rapid decline in wildlife population and forestry has become essential. But why do we need to conserve our forests and_ wildlife? Conservation preserves the ecological diversity and our life support systems - water, air and soil. It also preserves the genetic diversity of plants and animals for better growth of species and breeding. For example, in agriculture, we are still dependent on traditional crop varieties. Fisheries too are heavily dependent on the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity. In the 196Os and 197Os, conservationists demanded a national wildlife protection programme.

Se . eoue Tribal women selling minor forest produce Leaf litter collection by women folk Fig. 2.1 Act was implemented in 1972, with various provisions for protecting habitats. An all- India list of protected species was also published. The thrust of the programme was towards protecting the remaining population of certain endangered species by banning hunting, giving legal protection to their habitats, and restricting trade in wildlife. Subsequently, central and many state governments established national parks and wildlife sanctuaries about which you have already studied. The central government also announced several projects for protecting specific animals, which were gravely threatened, including the tiger, the one- horned rhinoceros, the Kashmir stag or hangul, three types of crocodiles — fresh water crocodile, saltwater crocodile and the Gharial, the Asiatic lion, and others. Most recently, the Indian elephant, black buck (chinkara), the great Indian bustard (godawan) and the snow leopard, etc. have ~ been given full or partial legal protection {wv against hunting and trade throughout India. CONTEMPORARY INDIA — II td Project Tiger Tiger is one of the key wildlife species in the faunal web. In 1973, the authorities realised that the tiger population had dwindled to 1,827 from an estimated 55,OOO at the turn of the century. The major threats to tiger population are numerous, such as poaching for trade, shrinking habitat, depletion of prey base species, growing human population, etc. The trade of tiger skins and the use of their bones in traditional medicines, especially in the Asian countries left the tiger population on the verge of extinction. Since India and Nepal provide habitat to about two-thirds of the surviving tiger population in the world, these two nations became prime targets for poaching and illegal trading. “Project Tiger”, one of the well- publicised wildlife campaigns in the world, was launched in 1973. Tiger conservation has been viewed not only as an effort to save an endangered species, but with Fig. 2.2: Rhino and deer in Kaziranga National Park equal importance as a means of preserving biotypes of sizeable magnitude. Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand, Sunderbans National Park in West Bengal, Bandhavgarh National Park in Madhya Pradesh, Sariska Wildlife Sanctuary in Rajasthan, Manas Tiger Reserve in Assam e . . . and Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala are } some of the tiger reserves of India. The conservation projects are now focusing on biodiversity rather than on a few of its components. There is now a more intensive search for different conservation measures. Increasingly, even insects are beginning to find a place in conservation planning. In the notification under Wildlife Act of 198O and 1986, several hundred butterflies, moths, beetles, and one dragonfly have been added to the list of protected species. In 1991, for the first time plants were also added to the list, starting with six species. - Activity Collect more information on the wildlife sanctuaries and national parks of India and cite their locations on the map of India. Types and Distribution of Forest and Wildlife Resources Even if we want to conserve our vast forest and wildlife resources, it is rather difficult to manage, control and regulate them. In India, much of its forest and wildlife resources are either owned or managed by the government through the Forest Department or other government departments. These are classified under the following categories. (j) Reserved Forests: More than half of the total forest land has been declared reserved forests. Reserved forests are regarded as the most valuable as far as the conservation of forest and wildlife resources are concerned. (ii) Protected Forests: Almost one-third of the total forest area is protected forest, as declared by the Forest Department. This forest land are protected from any further depletion. (iii) Unclassed Forests: These are other forests and wastelands belonging to both government and private individuals and communities. Reserved and protected forests are also referred to as permanent forest estates maintained for the purpose of producing timber and other forest produce, and for protective reasons. Madhya Pradesh has the largest area under permanent forests, constituting 75 per cent of its total forest area. Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Maharashtra have large percentages of reserved forests of its total forest area whereas Bihar, Haryana, Punjab, I Himachal Pradesh, Odisha and Rajasthan have a bulk of it under protected forests.

What\n\nYou already know that three-fourth of the\nearth’s surface is covered with water, but only\na small proportion of it accounts for\nfreshwater that can be put to use. This\nfreshwater is mainly obtained from surface\nrun off and ground water that is continually\nbeing renewed and recharged through the\nhydrological cycle. All water moves within the\nhydrological cycle ensuring that water is a\nrenewable resource.\n\nYou might wonder that if three-fourth of\nthe world is covered with water and water is\na renewable resource, then how is it that\ncountries and regions around the globe suffer\nfrom water scarcity? Why is it predicted that\nby 2025, nearly two billion people will live in\nabsolute water scarcity?\n\nhavoc they have created it has destroyed and\nswept away everything in its path.\n\nYes, Chintu, I did. Isn't it strange that\nwater can give life and take life as well.\nWhat would we do without water?\n\nWe need water to drink, cook our\nfood, wash our clothes and wash\nourselves as well. My father was\ntelling me that in his factory they\nneed a lot of water for a number of\nthings. Did you know that they even\nneed water for cooling the machines?\nIn fact, the factory runs on the power supplied by the\nhydel power plant. Now, I can understand why\nthrough the ages we humans have chosen to live\n\nnear water courses along the rivers and other water\nsources like springs, lakes, ponds and oases.\n\nWATER SCARCITY AND THE NEED FOR WATER\nCONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT\n\nGiven the abundance and renewability of\nwater, it is difficult to imagine that we may\nsuffer from water scarcity. The moment we\nspeak of water shortages, we immediately\nassociate it with regions having low rainfall\nor those that are drought prone. We\ninstantaneously visualise the deserts of\nRajasthan and women balancing many\n‘matkas’ (earthen pots) used for collecting\nand storing water and travelling long\ndistances to get water. True, the availability\nof water resources varies over space and time,\nmainly due to the variations in seasonal and\nannual precipitation, but water scarcity in\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nmost cases is caused by over-exploitation,\nexcessive use and unequal access to water\namong different social groups.\n\nWhere is then water scarcity likely to\noccur? As you have read in the hydrological\ncycle, freshwater can be obtained directly\nfrom precipitation, surface run off and\ngroundwater.\n\nIs it possible that an area or region may\nhave ample water resources but is still facing\nwater scarcity? Many of our cities are such\nexamples. Thus, water scarcity may be an\noutcome of large and growing population and\n\nconsequent greater demands for water, and\nunequal access to it. A large population\nrequires more water not only for domestic\nuse but also to produce more food. Hence, to\nfacilitate higher food-grain production, water\nresources are being over-exploited to expand\nirrigated areas for dry-season agriculture.\nIrrigated agriculture is the largest consumer\nof water. Now it is needed to revolutionise the\nagriculture through developing drought\nresistant crops and dry farming techniques.\nYou may have seen in many television\nadvertisements that most farmers have their\n\nUe sit Sasa WA 25 Veh. sitaa artis aat are eer AW ae ar ats\nare Tet F at Ga site 114 Set, sitea anfttee aut are eat Sor\nufa aed fenet srr Y qar saya User Fi Ser A ser at Sacrerar siz\nWAR ST H arya BAfad Hears + BA a aA Ht aat sr se\nadl-arelt & asit @ agent ay F aen are & rae sat SH are\nerrern At Tet aor HH fore Ure ant apett SH era Fi A et yer areor Fer\n\nWater, Water Everywhere, Not a Drop to Drink:\nAfter a heavy downpour, a boy collects drinking\nwater in Kolkata.

Today, large\nindustrial houses are as commonplace as the\nindustrial units of many MNCs (Multinational\nCorporations). The ever-increasing number of\nindustries has made matters worse by exerting\npressure on existing freshwater resources.\nIndustries, apart from being heavy users of\nwater, also require power to run them. Much\nof this energy comes from hydroelectric power.\nMoreover, multiplying urban centres with\nlarge and dense populations and urban\nlifestyles have not only added to water and\nenergy requirements but have further\naggravated the problem. If you look into the\nhousing societies or colonies in the cities, you\nwould find that most of these have their own\ngroundwater pumping devices to meet their\nwater needs. Not surprisingly, we find that\nfragile water resources are being over-\nexploited and have caused their depletion in\nseveral of these cities.\n\nDo you know?\n\nAtal Bhujal Yojana (Atal Jal) is being\nimplemented in 8220 water stressed Gram\nPanchayats of 229 administrative blocks /\ntalukas in 80 districts of seven states, viz.\nGujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya\nPradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and\nUttar Pradesh.

Now, let us consider\nanother situation where water is sufficiently\n\navailable to meet the needs of the people, but,\nthe area still suffers from water scarcity. This\nscarcity may be due to bad quality of water.\nLately, there has been a growing concern that\neven if there is ample water to meet the needs\nof the people, much of it may be polluted by\ndomestic and industrial wastes, chemicals,\npesticides and fertilisers used in agriculture,\nthus, making it hazardous for human use.\nGovernment of India has accorded highest\npriority to improve the quality of life and\nenhance ease of living of people especially those\nliving in rual areas by announcing the Jal\nJeevan Mission (JJM). The Goal of JJM is to\nenable every rural household get assured\nsupply of potable piped water at a service level\nof 55 litres per capita per day regularly on\nlong-term basis by ensuring functionality of\nthe tap water connections.

In\nancient India, along with the sophisticated\nhydraulic structures, there existed an\nextraordinary tradition of water-harvesting\nsystem. People had in-depth knowledge of\nrainfall regimes and soil types and developed\nwide ranging techniques to harvest\nrainwater, groundwater, river water and flood\nwater in keeping with the local ecological\nconditions and their water needs. In hill and\nmountainous regions, people built diversion\nchannels like the ‘guls’ or ‘kuls’ of the\nWestern Himalayas for agriculture. ‘Rooftop\nrainwater harvesting’ was commonly\n\nBasic Safety Precautions To Be Taken :\n\npractised to store drinking water,\nparticularly in Rajasthan.

In arid and\nsemi-arid regions, agricultural fields were\nconverted into rain fed storage structures\nthat allowed the water to stand and moisten\nthe soil like the ‘khadins’ in Jaisalmer and\n‘JJohads’ in other parts of Rajasthan.\n\nIn the semi-arid and arid regions of\nRajasthan, particularly in Bikaner, Phalodi\nand Barmer, almost all the houses\ntraditionally had underground tanks or\ntankas for storing drinking water.

In Gendathur, a remote backward\nvillage in Mysuru, Karnataka, villagers have\ninstalled, in their household’s rooftop,\nrainwater harvesting system to meet their\nwater needs. Nearly 200 households have\ninstalled this system and the village has earned\nthe rare distinction of being rich in rainwater.\nSee Fig. 3.6 for a better understanding of the\nrooftop rainwater harvesting system which is\n\nadapted here.

What You already know that three-fourth of the earth’s surface is covered with water, but only a small proportion of it accounts for freshwater that can be put to use. This freshwater is mainly obtained from surface run off and ground water that is continually being renewed and recharged through the hydrological cycle. All water moves within the hydrological cycle ensuring that water is a renewable resource. You might wonder that if three-fourth of the world is covered with water and water is a renewable resource, then how is it that countries and regions around the globe suffer from water scarcity? Why is it predicted that by 2O25, nearly two billion people will live in absolute water scarcity? havoc they have created it has destroyed and swept away everything in its path. Yes, Chintu, I did. Isn't it strange that water can give life and take life as well. What would we do without water? We need water to drink, cook our food, wash our clothes and wash ourselves as well. My father was telling me that in his factory they need a lot of water for a number of things. Did you know that they even need water for cooling the machines? In fact, the factory runs on the power supplied by the hydel power plant. Now, I can understand why through the ages we humans have chosen to live near water courses along the rivers and other water sources like springs, lakes, ponds and oases. WATER SCARCITY AND THE NEED FOR WATER CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT Given the abundance and renewability of water, it is difficult to imagine that we may suffer from water scarcity. The moment we speak of water shortages, we immediately associate it with regions having low rainfall or those that are drought prone. We instantaneously visualise the deserts of Rajasthan and women balancing many ‘matkas’ (earthen pots) used for collecting and storing water and travelling long distances to get water. True, the availability of water resources varies over space and time, mainly due to the variations in seasonal and annual precipitation, but water scarcity in Reprint 2O25-26 most cases is caused by over-exploitation, excessive use and unequal access to water among different social groups. Where is then water scarcity likely to occur? As you have read in the hydrological cycle, freshwater can be obtained directly from precipitation, surface run off and groundwater. Is it possible that an area or region may have ample water resources but is still facing water scarcity? Many of our cities are such examples. Thus, water scarcity may be an outcome of large and growing population and consequent greater demands for water, and unequal access to it. A large population requires more water not only for domestic use but also to produce more food. Hence, to facilitate higher food-grain production, water resources are being over-exploited to expand irrigated areas for dry-season agriculture. Irrigated agriculture is the largest consumer of water. Now it is needed to revolutionise the agriculture through developing drought resistant crops and dry farming techniques.

But have you ever wondered what this could result in? That it may lead to falling groundwater levels, adversely affecting water availability and food security of the people. Post-independent India witnessed intensive industrialisation and urbanisation, creating vast opportunities for us. Today, large industrial houses are as commonplace as the industrial units of many MNCs (Multinational Corporations). The ever-increasing number of industries has made matters worse by exerting pressure on existing freshwater resources. Industries, apart from being heavy users of water, also require power to run them. Much of this energy comes from hydroelectric power. Moreover, multiplying urban centres with large and dense populations and urban lifestyles have not only added to water and energy requirements but have further aggravated the problem. If you look into the housing societies or colonies in the cities, you would find that most of these have their own groundwater pumping devices to meet their water needs. Not surprisingly, we find that fragile water resources are being over- exploited and have caused their depletion in several of these cities. Do you know? Atal Bhujal Yojana (Atal Jal) is being implemented in 822O water stressed Gram Panchayats of 229 administrative blocks / talukas in 8O districts of seven states, viz. Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. The selected States account for about 37 per cent of the total number of water— stressed (over-exploited, critical and semi-critical) blocks in India. One of the key aspects of Atal Jal is to bring in behavioural changes in the community, from the prevailing attitude of consumption to conservation and smart water management. Source: Annual Report, Ministry of Jal Shakti, Government of India 2O22-23 So far we have focused on the quantitative aspects of water scarcity. Now, let us consider another situation where water is sufficiently available to meet the needs of the people, but, the area still suffers from water scarcity. This scarcity may be due to bad quality of water. Lately, there has been a growing concern that even if there is ample water to meet the needs of the people, much of it may be polluted by domestic and industrial wastes, chemicals, pesticides and fertilisers used in agriculture, thus, making it hazardous for human use. Government of India has accorded highest priority to improve the quality of life and enhance ease of living of people especially those living in rual areas by announcing the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM). The Goal of JJM is to enable every rural household get assured supply of potable piped water at a service level of 55 litres per capita per day regularly on long-term basis by ensuring functionality of the tap water connections. (Source: Economic Survey 2O2O-21, p.357) You may have already realised that the need of the hour is to conserve and manage our water resources, to safeguard ourselves from health hazards, to ensure food security, continuation of our livelihoods and productive activities and also to prevent degradation of our natural ecosystems. Over exploitation and mismanagement of water resources will impoverish this resource and cause ecological crisis that may have profound impact on our lives. Activity From your everyday experiences, write a short proposal on how you can conserve water. MULTI-PURPOSE RIVER PROJECTS AND INTEGRATED WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT But, how do we conserve and manage water? Archaeological and historical records show that from ancient times we have been constructing sophisticated hydraulic structures like dams built of stone rubble, reservoirs or lakes, embankments and canals for irrigation. Not surprisingly, we have continued this tradition in modern India by building dams in most of our river basins.

Damodar, we fall at your feet Bhadu will come a year later Reprint 2O25-26 In recent years, multi-purpose projects and large dams have come under great scrutiny and opposition for a variety of reasons. Regulating and damming of rivers affect their natural flow causing poor sediment flow and excessive sedimentation at the bottom of the reservoir, resulting in rockier stream beds and poorer habitats for the rivers’ aquatic life. Dams also fragment rivers making it difficult for aquatic fauna to migrate, especially for spawning. The reservoirs that are created on the floodplains also submerge the existing vegetation and soil leading to its decomposition over a period of time. Do you know? Sardar Sarovar Dam has been built over the Narmada River in Gujarat. This is one of the largest water resource projects of India covering four states—Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan. The Sardar Sarovar project would meet the requirement of water in drought-prone and desert areas. Sardar Sarovar Project will provide irrigation facilities to 18.45 lakh hectare of land, covering 3112 villages in 15 districts of Gujarat. It will also irrigate 2,46,OOO hectare of land in the strategic desert districts of Barmer and Jalore in Rajasthan and 37,5OO hectare in the tribal hilly tract of Maharashtra through lift. About 75 per cent of the command area in Gujarat is drought prone while entire command in Rajasthan is drought prone. Assured water supply will soon make this area drought proof. Source: Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd. https://www.sardarsarovardam. o1rg/ Ironically, the dams that were constructed to control floods have triggered floods due to sedimentation in the reservoir. Moreover, the big dams have mostly been unsuccessful in controlling floods at the time of excessive rainfall. Activity Collect information about floods occurred in different parts of the country due to heavy rainfall in recent times. These floods have not only devastated life and property but also caused extensive soil erosion. Sedimentation also meant that the flood plains were deprived of silt, a natural fertiliser, further adding on to the problem of land degradation. It was also observed that the multi- purpose projects induced earthquakes, caused water-borne diseases and pests and pollution resulting from excessive use of water. Irrigation has also changed the cropping pattern of many regions with farmers shifting to water intensive and commercial crops. This has great ecological consequences like salinisation of the soil. Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana has been started which ensures access to some means to protective irrigation for all agricultural farms in the country, thus bringing much desired rural prosperity. Some of the broad objectives of this programme are to enhance the physical access of water on the farm and expand cultivable area under assured irrigation (har khet ko pani), improve on-farm water use efficiency to reduce wastage and increase availability both in duration and extent, irrigation and other water saving technologies (per drop more crop) and introduce sustainable water conservation practices, etc. Do you know? Do you know that the Krishna-Godavari dispute is due to the objections raised by Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh governments? It is regarding the diversion of more water at Koyna by the Maharashtra government for a multipurpose project. This would reduce downstream flow in their states with adverse consequences for agriculture and industry. Activity Make a list of inter-state water disputes.

MYANMAR BAY OF BENGAL “s ANDAMAN & INDIA) ISLANDS RAINWATER HARVESTING Many thought that given the disadvantages and rising resistance against the multi- purpose projects, water harvesting system was a viable alternative, both socio- economically and environmentally. In ancient India, along with the sophisticated hydraulic structures, there existed an extraordinary tradition of water-harvesting system. People had in-depth knowledge of rainfall regimes and soil types and developed wide ranging techniques to harvest rainwater, groundwater, river water and flood water in keeping with the local ecological conditions and their water needs. In hill and mountainous regions, people built diversion channels like the ‘guls’ or ‘kuls’ of the Western Himalayas for agriculture. ‘Rooftop rainwater harvesting’ was commonly Basic Safety Precautions To Be Taken : practised to store drinking water, particularly in Rajasthan. In the flood plains of Bengal, people developed inundation channels to irrigate their fields. In arid and semi-arid regions, agricultural fields were converted into rain fed storage structures that allowed the water to stand and moisten the soil like the ‘khadins’ in Jaisalmer and ‘JJohads’ in other parts of Rajasthan. In the semi-arid and arid regions of Rajasthan, particularly in Bikaner, Phalodi and Barmer, almost all the houses traditionally had underground tanks or tankas for storing drinking water. The tanks could be as large as a big room; one household in Phalodi had a tank that was 6.1 metres deep, 4.27 metres long and 2.44 metres wide. The tankas were part of the well- developed rooftop rainwater harvesting THE RIDE OF HIS LIFE Listen to radio/TV for the latest weather bulletins and flood warnings.

It is interesting because Cherapunjee and Mawsynram situated at a distance of 55 km. from Shillong receive the highest rainfall in the world, yet the state capital Shillong faces acute shortage of water. Nearly every household in the city has a rooftop rainwater harvesting structure. Nearly 15-25 per cent of the total water requirement of the household comes from rooftop water harvesting. Activity Find out other rainwater harvesting systems existing in and around your locality. room cool. Today, in western Rajasthan, sadly the practice of rooftop rainwater harvesting is on the decline as plenty of water is available due to the perennial Indira Gandhi Canal, though some houses still maintain the tankas since they do not like the taste of tap water. Fortunately, in many parts of rural and urban India, rooftop rainwater harvesting is being successfully adapted to store and conserve water. In Gendathur, a remote backward village in Mysuru, Karnataka, villagers have installed, in their household’s rooftop, rainwater harvesting system to meet their water needs. Nearly 2OO households have installed this system and the village has earned the rare distinction of being rich in rainwater. See Fig. 3.6 for a better understanding of the rooftop rainwater harvesting system which is adapted here. Gendathur receives an annual precipitation of 1,OOO mm, and with 8O per cent of collection efficiency and of about 1O fillings, every house can collect and use about 5O,OOO litres of water annually. From the 2OO houses, the net amount of rainwater harvested annually amounts to 1,OO,OOO litres. Rooftop harvesting was common across the towns and villages of the Thar. Rainwater that falls on the sloping roofs of houses is taken through a pipe into an underground tanka (circular holes in the ground). built in the main house or in the courtyard. The picture above shows water being taken from a neighbour’s roof through a long pipe. Here the neighbour’s rooftop has been used for collection of rainwater. The picture shows a hole through which rainwater flows down into an underground tanka.

In Gendathur, a remote backward\nvillage in Mysuru, Karnataka, villagers have\ninstalled, in their household’s rooftop,\nrainwater harvesting system to meet their\nwater needs. Nearly 200 households have\ninstalled this system and the village has earned\nthe rare distinction of being rich in rainwater.\nSee Fig. 3.6 for a better understanding of the\nrooftop rainwater harvesting system which is\n\nadapted here. Gendathur receives an annual\nprecipitation of 1,000 mm, and with 80 per\ncent of collection efficiency and of about 10\nfillings, every house can collect and use about\n50,000 litres of water annually. From the 200\nhouses, the net amount of rainwater harvested\nannually amounts to 1,00,000 litres.\n\nRooftop harvesting was common across the towns\nand villages of the Thar. Rainwater that falls on\nthe sloping roofs of houses is taken through a\npipe into an underground tanka (circular holes in\nthe ground). built in the main house or in the\ncourtyard. The picture above shows water being\n\ntaken from a neighbour’s roof through a long pipe.\n\nHere the neighbour’s rooftop has been used for\ncollection of rainwater.

These are also\nreflected in agricultural practices and\ncropping patterns in the country. Various\ntypes of food and fibre crops, vegetables and\nfruits, spices and condiments, etc. constitute\nsome of the important crops grown in the\ncountry. India has three cropping seasons\n— rabi, kharif and zaid.\n\nRabi crops are sown in winter from October\nto December and harvested in summer from\nApril to June. Some of the important rabi\ncrops are wheat, barley, peas, gram and\nmustard. Though, these crops are grown in\nlarge parts of India, states from the north\nand north-western parts such as Punjab,\nHaryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and\nKashmir, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are\nimportant for the production of wheat and\nother rabi crops. Availability of precipitation\nduring winter months due to the western\ntemperate cyclones helps in the success of\nthese crops. However, the success of the green\nrevolution in Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar\nPradesh and parts of Rajasthan has also been\nan important factor in the growth of the above-\nmentioned rabi crops.\n\nKharif crops are grown with the onset of\nmonsoon in different parts of the country and\nthese are harvested in September-October.\nImportant crops grown during this season\nare paddy, maize, jowar, bajra, tur (arhar),\nmoong, urad, cotton, jute, groundnut and\nsoyabean. Some of the most important rice-\ngrowing regions are Assam, West Bengal,\ncoastal regions of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh,\nTelangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and\nMaharashtra, particularly the (Konkan coast)\nalong with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Recently,\npaddy has also become an important crop of\nPunjab and Haryana. In states like Assam,\nWest Bengal and Odisha, three crops of paddy\nare grown in a year. These are Aus, Aman\nand Boro.\n\n| In between the rabi and the kharif seasons,\n‘there is a short season during the summer\nmonths known as the Zaid season.

It is the main food crop, in north\nand north-western part of the country. This\nrabi crop requires a cool growing season and\na bright sunshine at the time of ripening. It\nrequires 50 to 75 cm of annual rainfall evenly-\ndistributed over the growing season.

Sustained uses of land\nwithout compatible techno-institutional\nchanges have hindered the pace of agricultural\ndevelopment. Inspite of development of sources\nof irrigation most of the farmers in large parts\nof the country still depend upon monsoon and\nnatural fertility in order to carry on their\nagriculture. For a growing population, this\nposes a serious challenge. Agriculture which\nprovides livelihood for more than 60 per cent of\nits population, needs some serious technical\nand institutional reforms. Thus,\ncollectivisation, consolidation of holdings,\ncooperation and abolition of zamindari, etc.\nwere given priority to bring about institutional\nreforms in the country after Independence.\n‘Land reform’ was the main focus of our First\nFive Year Plan.

    "cleaned_text": "India is an agriculturally important country. Two-thirds of its population is engaged in agricultural activities. Agriculture is a primary activity, which produces most of the food that we consume. Besides food grains, it also produces raw material for various industries. Can you name some industries based on agricultural raw material? Moreover, some agricultural products like tea, coffee, spices, etc. are also exported. TYPES OF FARMING Agriculture is an age-old economic activity in our country. Over these years, cultivation methods have changed significantly depending upon the characteristics of physical environment, technological know-how and socio-cultural practices. Farming varies from subsistence to commercial type. At present, in different parts of India, the following farming systems are practised. Primitive Subsistence Farming This type of farming is still practised in few pockets of India. Primitive subsistence agriculture is practised on small patches of land with the help of primitive tools like hoe, dao and digging sticks, and family/ community labour. This type of farming depends upon monsoon, natural fertility of the soil and suitability of other environmental conditions to the crops grown. It is a ‘slash and burn’ agriculture. Farmers clear a patch of land and produce cereals and other food crops to sustain their family. When the soil fertility decreases, the farmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land for cultivation. This type of shifting allows Nature to replenish the fertility of the soil through natural processes; land productivity in this type of agriculture is low as the farmer does not use fertilisers or other modern inputs. It is known by different names in different parts of the country. Can you name some such types of farmings? It is jhumming in north-eastern states like Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland; Pamlou in Manipur, Dipa in Bastar district of Chhattishgarh, and in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. 8 Jhumming: The ‘slash and burn’ agriculture is known as ‘Milpa’ in Mexico and Central America, ‘Conuco’ in Venzuela, ‘Roca’ in Brazil, ‘Masole’ in Central Africa, ‘Ladang’ in Indonesia, ‘Ray’ in Vietnam. In India, this primitive form of cultivation is called ‘Bewar’ or ‘Dahiya’ in Madhya Pradesh, ‘Podu’ or ‘Penda’ in Andhra Pradesh, ‘Pama Dabi’ or ‘Koman’ or Bringa’ in Odisha, ‘Kumari’ in Western Ghats, ‘Valre’ or ‘Waltre’ in South-eastern Rajasthan, ‘Khil’ in the Himalayan belt, ‘Kuruwa’ in Jharkhand, and Jhumming’ in the North-eastern region. aa pies & Reprint 2O25-26 e—, Rinjha lived with her family in a small village at the outskirts of Diphu in Assam. She enjoys \\ watching her family members clearing, ~ slashing and burning a patch of land for cultivation. She often helps them in irrigating the fields with water running through a bamboo canal from the nearby spring. She loves the surroundings and wants to stay here as long as she can, but this little girl e has no idea about the declining fertility of © the soil and her family’s search for fresh a y patch of land in the next season. Can you name the type of farming Rinjha’s family is engaged in? Can you enlist some crops which are grown in such farming? Intensive Subsistence Farming This type of farming is practised in areas of high population pressure on land. It is labour- intensive farming, where high doses of biochemical inputs and irrigation are used for obtaining higher production. Can you name some of the states of India where such farming is practised? Though the ‘right of inheritance’ leading to the division of land among successive generations has rendered land-holding size uneconomical, the farmers continue to take maximum output from the limited land in the absence of alternative source of livelihood. Thus, there is enormous pressure on agricultural land. Commercial Farming The main characteristic of this type of farming is the use of higher doses of modern inputs, e.g. high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, chemical fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides in order to obtain higher productivity. The degree of commercialisation of agriculture varies from one region to another. For example, rice is a commercial crop in Haryana and Punjab, but in Odisha, it is a subsistence crop. Can you give some more examples of crops which may be commercial in one region and may provide subsistence in another region? Plantation is also a type of commercial farming. In this type of farming, a single crop is grown on a large area. The plantation has an interface of agriculture and industry. Plantations cover large tracts of land, using capital intensive inputs, with the help of migrant labourers. All the produce is used as raw material in respective industries. In India, tea, coffee, rubber, sugarcane, banana, etc., are important plantation crops. Tea in Assam and North Bengal coffee in Karnataka are some of the important plantation crops grown in these states. Since the production is mainly for market, a well- developed network of transport and communication connecting the plantation areas, processing industries and markets plays an important role in the development of plantations.

These are also reflected in agricultural practices and cropping patterns in the country. Various types of food and fibre crops, vegetables and fruits, spices and condiments, etc. constitute some of the important crops grown in the country. India has three cropping seasons — rabi, kharif and zaid. Rabi crops are sown in winter from October to December and harvested in summer from April to June. Some of the important rabi crops are wheat, barley, peas, gram and mustard. Though, these crops are grown in large parts of India, states from the north and north-western parts such as Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are important for the production of wheat and other rabi crops. Availability of precipitation during winter months due to the western temperate cyclones helps in the success of these crops. However, the success of the green revolution in Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan has also been an important factor in the growth of the above- mentioned rabi crops. Kharif crops are grown with the onset of monsoon in different parts of the country and these are harvested in September-October. Important crops grown during this season are paddy, maize, jowar, bajra, tur (arhar), moong, urad, cotton, jute, groundnut and soyabean. Some of the most important rice- growing regions are Assam, West Bengal, coastal regions of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra, particularly the (Konkan coast) along with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Recently, paddy has also become an important crop of Punjab and Haryana. In states like Assam, West Bengal and Odisha, three crops of paddy are grown in a year. These are Aus, Aman and Boro. I In between the rabi and the kharif seasons, ‘there is a short season during the summer months known as the Zaid season. Some of the crops produced during ‘zaid’ are CN CONTEMPORARY INDIA — II watermelon, muskmelon, cucumber, vegetables and fodder crops. Sugarcane takes almost a year to grow. Major Crops A variety of food and non food crops are grown in different parts of the country depending upon the variations in soil, climate and cultivation practices. Major crops grown in India are rice, wheat, millets, pulses, tea, coffee, sugarcane, oil seeds, cotton and jute, etc. Rice: It is the staple food crop of a majority of the people in India. Our country is the second largest producer of rice in the world after China. It is a kharif crop which requires high temperature, (above 25°C) and high humidity with annual rainfall above 1OO cm. In the areas of less rainfall, it grows with the help of irrigation.

Wheat: This is the second most important cereal crop. It is the main food crop, in north and north-western part of the country. This rabi crop requires a cool growing season and a bright sunshine at the time of ripening. It requires 5O to 75 cm of annual rainfall evenly- distributed over the growing season. There are two important wheat-growing zones in the country — the Ganga-Satluj plains in the north-west and black soil region of the Deccan. The major wheat-producing states are Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan. Fig. 4.5: Wheat Cultivation Millets: Jowar, bajra and ragi are the important millets grown in India. Though, these are known as coarse grains, they have very high nutritional value. For example, ragi is very rich in iron, calcium, other micro nutrients and roughage. Jowar is the third most important food crop with respect to area and production.

Can you distinguish which of these pulses are grown in the kharif season and which are grown in the rabi season? Pulses need less moisture and survive even in dry conditions. Being leguminous crops, all these crops except arhar help in restoring soil fertility by fixing nitrogen from the air. Therefore, these are mostly grown in rotation with other crops. Major pulse producing states in India are Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka. Food Crops other than Grains Sugarcane: It is a tropical as well as a subtropical crop.

Oil Seeds: In 2O2O India was the second largest producer of groundnut in the world after China. Different oil seeds are grown covering approximately 12 per cent of the total cropped area of the country. Main oil-seeds produced in India are groundnut, mustard, coconut, sesamum (til), soyabean, castor seeds, cotton seeds, linseed and sunflower. Most of these are edible and used as cooking mediums. However, some of these are also used as raw material in the production of soap, cosmetics and ointments. Groundnut is a kharif crop and accounts for about half of the major oilseeds produced in the country. Gujarat was the largest producer of groundnut followed by Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu in 2O19-2O. Linseed and mustard are rabi crops. Sesamum is a kharif crop in north and rabi crop in south India. Castor seed is grown both as rabi and kharif crop. Tea: Tea cultivation is an example of plantation agriculture. It is also an important beverage crop introduced in India initially by the British. Today, most of the tea plantations are owned by Indians. The tea plant grows well in tropical and sub-tropical climates endowed with deep and fertile well-drained soil, rich in humus and organic matter.

It is mainly grown in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andaman and Nicobar islands and Garo hills of Meghalaya. Activity List the items which are made of rubber and are used by us. Fibre Crops: Cotton, jute, hemp and natural silk are the four major fibre crops grown in India. The first three are derived from the crops grown in the soil, the latter is obtained from cocoons of the silkworms fed on green leaves specially mulberry. Rearing of silk worms for the production of silk fibre is known as sericulture. Cotton: India is believed to be the original home of the cotton plant. Cotton is one of the main raw materials for cotton textile industry. India is second largest producer of cotton after China. Cotton grows well in drier parts of the black cotton soil of the Deccan plateau. It requires high temperature, light rainfall or irrigation, 21O frost-free days and bright sun-shine for its growth. Itis a kharif crop and requires 6 to 8 months to mature. Major cotton-producing states are- Cotton Cultivation Fig. 4.14: yh ‘a 38 CONTEMPORARY INDIA — II Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Jute: It is known as the golden fibre. Jute grows well on well-drained fertile soils in the flood plains where soils are renewed every year. High temperature is required during the time of growth. West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Odisha and Meghalaya are the major jute producing states. Itis used in making gunny bags, mats, ropes, yarn, carpets and other artefacts. Technological and Institutional Reforms It was mentioned in the previous pages that agriculture has been practised in India for thousands of years. Sustained uses of land without compatible techno-institutional changes have hindered the pace of agricultural development. Inspite of development of sources of irrigation most of the farmers in large parts of the country still depend upon monsoon and natural fertility in order to carry on their agriculture. For a growing population, this poses a serious challenge. Agriculture which provides livelihood for more than 6O per cent of its population, needs some serious technical and institutional reforms. Thus, collectivisation, consolidation of holdings, cooperation and abolition of zamindari, etc. were given priority to bring about institutional reforms in the country after Independence. ‘Land reform’ was the main focus of our First Five Year Plan. The right of inheritance had already led to fragmentation of land holdings necessitating consolidation of holdings. The laws of land reforms were enacted but the implementation was lacking or lukewarm. The Government of India embarked upon introducing agricultural reforms to improve Indian agriculture in the 196Os and 197Os. The Green Revolution based on the use of package technology and the White Revolution (Operation Flood) were some of the strategies initiated to improve the lot of Indian agriculture. But, this too led to the concentration of development in few selected areas. Therefore, in the 198Os and 199Os, a comprehensive land development programme was initiated, which included both institutional and technical Reprint 2O25-26 H Kee a y - fo holake Loerie nso ST Skis ~ a ~- ; 4 4 - kg ae \\F , ¥ easy : > \\ i eee. * eS ae ; 4 : 4 ll 1 : Ta, i, ae - 1 : rf ‘ Fig. 4.15: Modern technological equipments used in agriculture reforms. Provision for crop insurance against drought, flood, cyclone, fire and disease, establishment of Grameen banks, cooperative societies and banks for providing loan facilities to the farmers at lower rates of interest were some important steps in this direction. Kisan Credit Card (KCC), Personal Accident Insurance Scheme (PAIS) are some other schemes introduced by the Government of India for the benefit of the farmers. Moreover, special weather bulletins and agricultural programmes for farmers were introduced on the radio and television. The government also announces minimum support price, remunerative and procurement prices for important crops to check the exploitation of farmers by speculators and middlemen.

Discuss about the benefits of the information available on the portal. Bhoodan - Gramdan ° Mahatma Gandhi declared Vinoba Bhave as his spiritual heir. He also participated in te Satyagraha as one of the foremost satyagrahis. He was one of the votaries of Gandhi's concept of gram swaraijya. After Gandhiji’s martyrdom, Vinoba Bhave undertook padyatra to spread Gandhiji’s message covered almost the entire country. Once, when he was delivering a lecture at Pochampalli in Andhra Pradesh, some poor landless villagers demanded some land for their economic well-being. Vinoba Bhave could not promise it to them immediately but assured them to talk to the Government of India regarding provision of land for them if they undertook cooperative farming. Suddenly, Shri Ram Chandra Reddy stood up and offered 8O acres of land to be distributed among 8O land-less villagers. This act was known as ‘Bhoodan’. Later he travelled and introduced his ideas widely all over India. Some zamindars, owners of many villages offered to distribute some villages among the landless. It was known as Gramdan. However, many land-owners chose to provide some part of their land to the poor farmers due to the fear of land e ceiling act. This Bhoodan-Gramdan movement initiated by Vinoba Bhave is also known as the Blood-less Revolution. AGRICULTURE Reprint 2O25-26 Rr \\ ic EI EXERCISES 1. Multiple choice questions.

Agriculture is a primary\nactivity, which produces most of the food that\nwe consume. Besides food grains, it also\nproduces raw material for various industries.\n\nCan you name some industries based on\nagricultural raw material?\n\nMoreover, some agricultural products like tea,\ncoffee, spices, etc. are also exported.\n\nTYPES OF FARMING\n\nAgriculture is an age-old economic activity in\nour country. Over these years, cultivation\nmethods have changed significantly depending\nupon the characteristics of physical\nenvironment, technological know-how and\nsocio-cultural practices. Farming varies from\nsubsistence to commercial type. At present,\nin different parts of India, the following\nfarming systems are practised.\n\nPrimitive Subsistence Farming\n\nThis type of farming is still practised in few\npockets of India. Primitive subsistence\nagriculture is practised on small patches of\nland with the help of primitive tools like hoe,\ndao and digging sticks, and family/\ncommunity labour. This type of farming\ndepends upon monsoon, natural fertility of\nthe soil and suitability of other environmental\nconditions to the crops grown.\n\nIt is a ‘slash and burn’ agriculture.\nFarmers clear a patch of land and produce\ncereals and other food crops to sustain their\nfamily. When the soil fertility decreases, the\nfarmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land\nfor cultivation. This type of shifting allows\nNature to replenish the fertility of the soil\n\nthrough natural processes; land productivity\nin this type of agriculture is low as the farmer\ndoes not use fertilisers or other modern\n\ninputs. It is known by different names in\ndifferent parts of the country.\n\nCan you name some such types of farmings?\n\nIt is jhumming in north-eastern states like\nAssam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland;\nPamlou in Manipur, Dipa in Bastar district\nof Chhattishgarh, and in Andaman and\n\nNicobar Islands.\n8\n\nJhumming: The ‘slash and burn’ agriculture\nis known as ‘Milpa’ in Mexico and Central\nAmerica, ‘Conuco’ in Venzuela, ‘Roca’ in\nBrazil, ‘Masole’ in Central Africa, ‘Ladang’\nin Indonesia, ‘Ray’ in Vietnam.\n\nIn India, this primitive form of cultivation\nis called ‘Bewar’ or ‘Dahiya’ in Madhya\nPradesh, ‘Podu’ or ‘Penda’ in Andhra Pradesh,\n‘Pama Dabi’ or ‘Koman’ or Bringa’ in Odisha,\n‘Kumari’ in Western Ghats, ‘Valre’ or ‘Waltre’\nin South-eastern Rajasthan, ‘Khil’ in the\nHimalayan belt, ‘Kuruwa’ in Jharkhand, and\nJhumming’ in the North-eastern region.\n\naa\npies &\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

She enjoys \\\nwatching her family members clearing, ~\nslashing and burning a patch of land for\ncultivation. She often helps them in irrigating\nthe fields with water running through a\nbamboo canal from the nearby spring. She\nloves the surroundings and wants to stay\nhere as long as she can, but this little girl\ne has no idea about the declining fertility of\n© the soil and her family’s search for fresh a\ny patch of land in the next season.\n\nCan you name the type of farming Rinjha’s\nfamily is engaged in?\n\nCan you enlist some crops which are grown\nin such farming?\n\nIntensive Subsistence Farming\n\nThis type of farming is practised in areas of\nhigh population pressure on land. It is labour-\nintensive farming, where high doses of\nbiochemical inputs and irrigation are used\nfor obtaining higher production.\n\nCan you name some of the states of India\nwhere such farming is practised?\n\nThough the ‘right of inheritance’ leading\nto the division of land among successive\ngenerations has rendered land-holding size\nuneconomical, the farmers continue to take\nmaximum output from the limited land in\nthe absence of alternative source of livelihood.\nThus, there is enormous pressure on\nagricultural land.\n\nCommercial Farming\n\nThe main characteristic of this type of farming\nis the use of higher doses of modern inputs,\ne.g. high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, chemical\nfertilisers, insecticides and pesticides in order\nto obtain higher productivity. The degree of\ncommercialisation of agriculture varies from\none region to another. For example, rice is a\ncommercial crop in Haryana and Punjab, but\nin Odisha, it is a subsistence crop.\n\nCan you give some more examples of crops\nwhich may be commercial in one region and\nmay provide subsistence in another region?\n\nPlantation is also a type of commercial\nfarming. In this type of farming, a single crop\nis grown on a large area. The plantation has\nan interface of agriculture and industry.\nPlantations cover large tracts of land, using\ncapital intensive inputs, with the help of\nmigrant labourers. All the produce is used\nas raw material in respective industries.\n\nIn India, tea, coffee, rubber, sugarcane,\nbanana, etc., are important plantation crops.\nTea in Assam and North Bengal coffee in\nKarnataka are some of the important\nplantation crops grown in these states.

These are also\nreflected in agricultural practices and\ncropping patterns in the country. Various\ntypes of food and fibre crops, vegetables and\nfruits, spices and condiments, etc. constitute\nsome of the important crops grown in the\ncountry. India has three cropping seasons\n— rabi, kharif and zaid.\n\nRabi crops are sown in winter from October\nto December and harvested in summer from\nApril to June. Some of the important rabi\ncrops are wheat, barley, peas, gram and\nmustard. Though, these crops are grown in\nlarge parts of India, states from the north\nand north-western parts such as Punjab,\nHaryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and\nKashmir, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are\nimportant for the production of wheat and\nother rabi crops. Availability of precipitation\nduring winter months due to the western\ntemperate cyclones helps in the success of\nthese crops. However, the success of the green\nrevolution in Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar\nPradesh and parts of Rajasthan has also been\nan important factor in the growth of the above-\nmentioned rabi crops.\n\nKharif crops are grown with the onset of\nmonsoon in different parts of the country and\nthese are harvested in September-October.\nImportant crops grown during this season\nare paddy, maize, jowar, bajra, tur (arhar),\nmoong, urad, cotton, jute, groundnut and\nsoyabean. Some of the most important rice-\ngrowing regions are Assam, West Bengal,\ncoastal regions of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh,\nTelangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and\nMaharashtra, particularly the (Konkan coast)\nalong with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

Different oil seeds are grown\ncovering approximately 12 per cent of the total\ncropped area of the country. Main oil-seeds\nproduced in India are groundnut, mustard,\ncoconut, sesamum (til), soyabean, castor\nseeds, cotton seeds, linseed and sunflower.\nMost of these are edible and used as cooking\nmediums. However, some of these are also\nused as raw material in the production of\nsoap, cosmetics and ointments.\n\nGroundnut is a kharif crop and accounts\nfor about half of the major oilseeds produced in\nthe country.

Sustained uses of land\nwithout compatible techno-institutional\nchanges have hindered the pace of agricultural\ndevelopment. Inspite of development of sources\nof irrigation most of the farmers in large parts\nof the country still depend upon monsoon and\nnatural fertility in order to carry on their\nagriculture. For a growing population, this\nposes a serious challenge. Agriculture which\nprovides livelihood for more than 60 per cent of\nits population, needs some serious technical\nand institutional reforms. Thus,\ncollectivisation, consolidation of holdings,\ncooperation and abolition of zamindari, etc.\nwere given priority to bring about institutional\nreforms in the country after Independence.\n‘Land reform’ was the main focus of our First\nFive Year Plan. The right of inheritance had\nalready led to fragmentation of land holdings\nnecessitating consolidation of holdings.\n\nThe laws of land reforms were enacted but\nthe implementation was lacking or lukewarm.\nThe Government of India embarked upon\nintroducing agricultural reforms to improve\nIndian agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe Green Revolution based on the use of\npackage technology and the White Revolution\n(Operation Flood) were some of the strategies\ninitiated to improve the lot of Indian agriculture.\nBut, this too led to the concentration of\ndevelopment in few selected areas.

ENEKGY KESOUKCES\n\n@\nHaban comes to Guwahati with his father\nfrom a remote village.\n\nHe sees people getting into strange\nhouse like objects which move along the\nroad. He also sees a “kitchen” dragging a\nnumber of house along with it. He is amazed\nand asked his father “Why don’t our houses\nmove like the one we saw in Guwahati, Ba?”\n\nBa replies, “These are not houses, they\nare buses and trains. Unlike our houses these\nare not made of bricks and stones, metal like\niron and alluminium are used in making\n\n@ these. They do not move on their own. They\nare driven by an engine which needs energy\nto work.”\n\nWe use different things in our daily life made\nfrom metal. Can you list a number of items\nused in your house made of metals. Where do\nthese metals come from?\n\nYou have studied that the earth’s crust is\nmade up of different minerals embedded in the\nrocks. Various metals are extracted from these\nminerals after proper refinement.\n\nMinerals are an indispensable part of our\nlives. Almost everything we use, from a tiny pin\nto a towering building or a big ship, all are\nmade from minerals. The railway lines and the\ntarmac (paving) of the roads, our implements\nand machinery too are made from minerals.\nCars, buses, trains, aeroplanes are\nmanufactured from minerals and run on\npower resources derived from the earth. Even\nthe food that we eat contains minerals. In all\nstages of development, human beings have\nused minerals for their livelihood, decoration,\nfestivities, religious and ceremonial rites.\n\n1068CHOS\n\nand minerals\n\ne\nA bright smile from toothpaste\n\nToothpaste cleans your teeth. Abrasive\nminerals like silica, limestone, aluminium\noxide and various phosphate minerals do the\ncleaning. Fluoride which is used to reduce\ncavities, comes from a mineral fluorite. Most\ntoothpaste are made white with titanium\noxide, which comes from minerals called\nrutile, ilmenite and anatase. The sparkle in\nsome toothpastes comes from mica. The\n®@ toothbrush and tube containing the paste are\n\nmade of plastics from petroleum. Find out\nwhere these minerals are found?\n\nDig a little deeper and find out how many\nminerals are used to make a light bulb?\n\nS\nAll living things need minerals\nLife processes cannot occur without minerals.\nAlthough our mineral intake represents only\nabout 0.3 per cent of our total intake of\n@ nutrients, they are so potent and so important\n\nthat without them we would not be able to\nutilise the other 99.7 per cent of foodstuffs.\n\nDig a little deeper and collect “Nutritional\nFacts” printed on food labels.\n\nWhat is a mineral?\n\nGeologists define mineral as a\n“homogenous, naturally occurring substance\nwith a definable internal structure.” Minerals\nare found in varied forms in nature, ranging\nfrom the hardest diamond to the softest talc.\nWhy are they so varied?\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nYou have already learnt about rocks.\nRocks are combinations of homogenous\nsubstances called minerals. Some rocks, for\ninstance limestone, consist of a single mineral\nonly, but majority of the rock consist of several\nminerals in varying proportions. Although,\nover 2000 minerals have been identified, only\na few are abundantly found in most of the\nrocks.\n\nA particular mineral that will be formed\nfrom a certain combination of elements\ndepends upon the physical and chemical\nconditions under which the material forms.\nThis, in turn, results in a wide range of colours,\nhardness, crystal forms, lustre and density that\na particular mineral possesses. Geologists use\nthese properties to classify the minerals.\n\n@-\nStudy of Minerals by Geographers\nand Geologists\n\nGeographers study minerals as part of the ~\nearth’s crust for a better understanding of\nlandforms. The distribution of mineral\nresources and associated economic activities\nare of interest to geographers. A geologist,\n@ however, is interested in the formation of\n\\. minerals, their age and physical and\nchemical composition.\nHowever, for general and commercial\npurposes minerals can be classified as under.\n\nMopDE oF OCCURRENCE OF MINERALS\n\nWhere are these minerals found?\n\nMinerals are usually found in “ores”. The\nterm ore is used to describe an accumulation\nof any mineral mixed with other elements.\nThe mineral content of the ore must be in\n\nsufficient concentration to make its extraction\ncommercially viable. The type of formation or\nstructure in which they are found determines\nthe relative ease with which mineral ores may\nbe mined. This also determines the cost of\nextraction. It is, therefore, important for us\nto understand the main types of formations\nin which minerals occur.\nMinerals generally occur in these forms:\n\n(i) In igneous and metamorphic rocks\nminerals may occur in the cracks,\ncrevices, faults or joints. The smaller\noccurrences are called veins and the\nlarger are called lodes. In most cases,\nthey are formed when minerals in liquid/\nmolten and gaseous forms are forced\nupward through cavities towards the\nearth’s surface. They cool and solidify as\nthey rise. Major metallic minerals like tin,\ncopper, zinc and lead etc. are obtained\nfrom veins and lodes.\n\n(ii) In sedimentary rocks a number of minerals\noccur in beds or layers. They have been\nformed as a result of deposition,\naccumulation and concentration in\nhorizontal strata. Coal and some forms of\niron ore have been concentrated as a result\nof long periods under great heat and\npressure. Another group of sedimentary\nminerals include gypsum, potash salt and\nsodium salt. These are formed as a result\nof evaporation especially in arid regions.\n\n(iii) Another mode of formation involves the\ndecomposition of surface rocks, and the\nremoval of soluble constituents, leaving\na residual mass of weathered\nmaterial containing ores. Bauxite is\nformed this way.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS\n\nMinerals\n\n' a Te”\n\nMetallic\n\nFerrous (containing Non-Ferrous\niron) e.g. iron ore, e.g. copper, lead,\nManganese, nickel __ tin, bauxite, etc.\ncobalt, etc.\n\nFig. 5.1\n\nPrecious\ne.g. gold, silver,\nplatinum, etc.\n\nNon-Metallic Energy Minerals\n\ne.g. mica, salt, Coal\npotash, sulphur, Petroleum\ngranite, limestone, Natural gas\n\nmarble, sandstone, etc.\n\nMINERALS AND ENERGY RESOURCES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\n(iv) Certain minerals may occur as alluvial\ndeposits in sands of valley floors and the\nbase of hills. These deposits are called\n‘placer deposits’ and generally contain\nminerals, which are not corroded by water.\nGold, silver, tin and platinum are most\nimportant among such minerals.\n\n(v) The ocean waters contain vast quantities\nof minerals, but most of these are too widely\ndiffused to be of economic significance.\nHowever, common salt, magnesium and\nbromine are largely derived from ocean\nwaters. The ocean beds, too, are rich in\n\ng mhganese nodules.\n\nInteresting Fact\n\nRat-Hole Mining. Do you know that most\nof the minerals in India are nationalised\nand their extraction is possible only after\nobtaining due permission from the\ngovernment? But in most of the tribal\nareas of the north-east India, minerals are\nowned by individuals or communities. In\nMeghalaya, there are large deposits of coal,\niron ore, limestone and dolomite etc. Coal\nmining in Jowai and Cherapunjee is done\nby family member in the form of a long\nnarrow tunnel, known as ‘Rat hole’\nmining. The National Green Tribunal has\ndeclared such activities illegal and\nrecommended that these should be\nstopped forthwith.\n\nDig a little deeper: What is the difference\nbetween an open pit mine, a quarry and an\nunderground mine with shafts?\n\nIndia is fortunate to have fairly rich and\nvaried mineral resources. However, these are\nunevenly distributed. Broadly speaking,\npeninsular rocks contain most of the reserves\nof coal, metallic minerals, mica and many other\nnon-metallic minerals. Sedimentary rocks on\nthe western and eastern flanks of the peninsula,\nin Gujarat and Assam have most of the\npetroleum deposits. Rajasthan with the rock\nsystems of the peninsula, has reserves of many\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nnon-ferrous minerals. The vast alluvial plains\nof north India are almost devoid of economic\nminerals. These variations exist largely because\nof the differences in the geological structure,\nprocesses and time involved in the formation\nof minerals.\n\nLet us now study the distribution of a few\nmajor minerals in India. Always remember that\nthe concentration of mineral in the ore, the ease\nof extraction and closeness to the market play\nan important role in affecting the economic\nviability of a reserve. Thus, to meet the demand,\na choice has to be made between a number of\npossible options. When this is done a mineral\n‘deposit’ or ‘reserve’ turns into a mine.\n\nFerrous Minerals\n\nFerrous minerals account for about three-\nfourths of the total value of the production of\nmetallic minerals. They provide a strong base\nfor the development of metallurgical industries.\nIndia exports substantial quantities of ferrous\nminerals after meeting her internal demands.\n\nIron Ore\n\nIron ore is the basic mineral and the backbone\nof industrial development. India is endowed\nwith fairly abundant resources of iron ore. India\nis rich in good quality iron ores. Magnetite is\nthe finest iron ore with a very high content of\niron up to 70 per cent. It has excellent magnetic\nqualities, especially valuable in the electrical\nindustry. Hematite ore is the most important\nindustrial iron ore in terms of the quantity\nused, but has a slightly lower iron content than\nmagnetite. (50-60 per cent). In 2018-19 almost\nentire production of iron ore (97%) accrued\nfrom Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and\nJharkhand. The remaining production (3%)\nwas from other states.\n\nDo you know?\n\nKudre in Kannada means horse. The\nhighest peak in the western ghats of\nKarnataka resembles the face of a horse.\nThe Bailadila hills look like the hump of\nan ox, and hence its name.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nFig. 5.2: Iron ore mine\n\nThe major iron ore belts in India are:\n\nOdisha-Jharkhand belt: In Odisha high\ngrade hematite ore is found in Badampahar\nmines in the Mayurbhanj and Kendujhar\ndistricts. In the adjoining Singbhum\ndistrict of Jnarkhand haematite iron ore is\nmined in Gua and Noamundi.\n\nDurg-Bastar-Chandrapur belt lies in\nChhattisgarh and Maharashtra. Very high\ngrade hematites are found in the famous\nBailadila range of hills in the Bastar district\nof Chhattisgarh. The range of hills\ncomprise of 14 deposits of super high\ngrade hematite iron ore. It has the best\nphysical properties needed for steel\nmaking. Iron ore from these mines is\nexported to Japan and South Korea via\nVishakhapatnam port.\n\nBallari-Chitradurga-Chikkamagaluru-\nTumakuru belt in Karnataka has large\nreserves of iron ore. The Kudremukh mines\nlocated in the Western Ghats of Karnataka\nare a 100 per cent export unit. Kudremukh\ndeposits are known to be one of the largest\nin the world. The ore is transported as\nslurry through a pipeline to a port near\nMangaluru.\n\nMaharashtra-Goa belt includes the state\nof Goa and Ratnagiri district of\n\nMaharashtra. Though, the ores are not of\nvery high quality, yet they are efficiently\nexploited. Iron ore is exported through\nMarmagao port.\n\nManganese\n\nManganese is mainly used in the\nmanufacturing of steel and ferro-manganese\nalloy. Nearly 10 kg of manganese is required\nto manufacture one tonne of steel. It is also\nused in manufacturing bleaching powder,\ninsecticides and paints.\n\nAndhra Others\nPradesh W%\n10%\n\nKarnataka\n12%\nMadhya\n\nPradesh\n33%\n\nOdisha\n16%\n\nMaharashtra\n27%\n\nFig. 5.3: Production of Manganese showing\nstate-wise share in per cent, 2018-19\n\nDig a little deeper: Superimpose the maps\n\nshowing distribution of iron ore, manganese,\n\ncoal and iron and steel industry.

Why?\n\nNon-Ferrous Minerals\n\nIndia’s reserves and production of non-\nferrous minerals is not very satisfactory.\nHowever, these minerals, which include\ncopper, bauxite, lead, zinc and gold play a\nvital role in a number of metallurgical,\nengineering and electrical industries.

The total volume of workable\nmineral deposits is an insignificant fraction\ni.e. one per cent of the earth’s crust. We are\nrapidly consuming mineral resources that\n\nconcentrated. The geological processes of\nmineral formation are so slow that the rates\nof replenishment are infinitely small in\ncomparison to the present rates of\nconsumption. Mineral resources are,\ntherefore, finite and non-renewable. Rich\nmineral deposits are our country’s extremely\nvaluable but short-lived possessions.\nContinued extraction of ores leads to\nincreasing costs as mineral extraction comes\n\nfrom greater depths along with decrease @.\n\nin quality.\n\nMINERALS AND ENERGY RESOURCES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nAconcerted effort has to be made in order\nto use our mineral resources in a planned\nand sustainable manner. Improved\ntechnologies need to be constantly evolved to\nallow use of low grade ores at low costs.\nRecycling of metals, using scrap metals and\nother substitutes are steps in conserving our\nmineral resources for the future.\n\nDig a little deeper: Make a list of items where\nsubstitutes are being used instead of minerals.\nWhere are these substitutes obtained from?\n\nEnergy Resources\n\nEnergy is required for all activities. It is needed\nto cook, to provide light and heat, to propel\nvehicles and to drive machinery in industries.\n\nEnergy can be generated from fuel\nminerals like coal, petroleum, natural gas,\nuranium and from electricity. Energy\nresources can be classified as conventional\nand non-conventional sources. Conventional\nsources include: firewood, cattle dung cake,\ncoal, petroleum, natural gas and electricity\n(both hydel and thermal). Non-conventional\nsources include solar, wind, tidal, geothermal,\nbiogas and atomic energy. Firewood and cattle\ndung cake are most common in rural India.\nAccording to one estimate more than 70 per\ncent energy requirement in rural households\nis met by these two ; continuation of these is\nincreasingly becoming difficult due to\ndecreasing forest area. Moreover, using dung\ncake too is being discouraged because it\nconsumes most valuable manure which could\nbe used in agriculture.\n\nConventional Sources of Energy\n\nCoal: In India, coal is the most abundantly\navailable fossil fuel. It provides a substantial\npart of the nation’s energy needs. It is used\nfor power generation, to supply energy to\nindustry as well as for domestic needs. India\nis highly dependent on coal for meeting its\ncommercial energy requirements.\n\nAs you are already aware that coal is\nformed due the compression of plant material\nover millions of years. Coal, therefore, is\nfound in a variety of forms depending on the\ndegrees of compression and the depth and\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig. 5.9 (b): A view from outside of a coal mine\n\ntime of burial.

It is the most popular coal\nin commercial use. Metallurgical coal is high\ngrade bituminous coal which has a special\nvalue for smelting iron in blast furnaces.\nAnthracite is the highest quality hard coal.\n\nIn India coal occurs in rock series of two\nmain geological ages, namely Gondwana, a\nlittle over 200 million years in age and in\ntertiary deposits which are only about 55\nmillion years old.

It provides\nfuel for heat and lighting, lubricants for\nmachinery and raw materials for a number of\nmanufacturing industries. Petroleum refineries\nact as a “nodal industry” for synthetic textile,\nfertiliser and numerous chemical industries.\n\nMost of the petroleum occurrences in India\nare associated with anticlines and fault traps\nin the rock formations of the tertiary age. In\nregions of folding, anticlines or domes, it\noccurs where oil is trapped in the crest of the\nupfold. The oil bearing layer is a porous\nlimestone or sandstone through which oil may\nflow. The oil is prevented from rising or\nsinking by intervening non-porous layers.\n\nPetroleum is also found in fault traps\nbetween porous and non-porous rocks. Gas,\nbeing lighter usually occurs above the oil.\n\nMumbai High, Gujarat and Assam are\n\nmajor petroleum production areas in India.\nFrom the map locate the 3 major off shore\nfields of western India.

It can be used as a domestic and\nindustrial fuel. It is used as fuel in power sector\nto generate electricity, for heating purpose in\nindustries, as raw material in chemical,\npetrochemical and fertilizer industries, as\ntransport fuel and as cooking fuel.

Show\nthem on the map of India.\n\nNon-Conventional Sources of Energy\n\nThe growing consumption of energy has\nresulted in the country becoming increasingly\ndependent on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and\ngas. Rising prices of oil and gas and their\npotential shortages have raised uncertainties\nabout the security of energy supply in future,\nwhich in turn has serious repercussions on the\ngrowth of the national economy. Moreover,\nincreasing use of fossil fuels also causes\nserious environmental problems. Hence, there\nis a pressing need to use renewable energy\nsources like solar energy, wind, tide, biomass\nand energy from waste material. These are\ncalled non-conventional energy sources.\n\nIndia is blessed with an abundance of\nsunlight, water, wind and biomass. It has the\nlargest programmes for the development of\nthese renewable energy resources.\n\nNuclear or Atomic Energy\n\nIt is obtained by altering the structure of\natoms. When such an alteration is made, much\nenergy is released in the form of heat and this\nis used to generate electric power. Uranium and\nThorium, which are available in Jharkhand and\nthe Aravalli ranges of Rajasthan are used for\ngenerating atomic or nuclear power. The\nMonazite sands of Kerala is also rich in\nThorium.\n\nLocate the 6 nuclear power stations and find\nout the state in which they are located.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nIndia is a tropical country. It has enormous\npossibilities of tapping solar energy.\nPhotovoltaic technology converts sunlight\ndirectly into electricity. Solar energy is fast\nbecoming popular in rural and remote areas.\nSome big solar power plants are being\nestablished in different parts of India which\nwill minimise the dependence of rural\nhouseholds on firewood and dung cakes,\nwhich in turn will contribute to environmental\nconservation and adequate supply of manure\nin agriculture.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig. 5.10: Solar operated electronic milk\ntesting equipment\n\nActivity\n\nCollect information about newly established\n\nsolar power plants in India.\n\nWind power\n\nIndia has great potential of wind power. The\nlargest wind farm cluster is located in Tamil\nNadu from Nagarcoil to Madurai. Apart from\nthese, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat,\nKerala, Maharashtra and Lakshadweep have\nimportant wind farms. Nagarcoil and\nJaisalmer are well known for effective use of\nwind energy in the country.\n\nFig. 5.11: Wind mills — Nagarcoil\n\nBiogas\n\nShrubs, farm waste, animal and human waste\nare used to produce biogas for domestic\nconsumption in rural areas. Decomposition\nof organic matter yields gas, which has higher\nthermal efficiency in comparison to kerosene,\ndung cake and charcoal. Biogas plants are\nset up at municipal, cooperative and\nindividual levels. The plants using cattle dung\nare known as ‘Gobar gas plants’ in rural India.\nThese provide twin benefits to the farmer in\nthe form of energy and improved quality of\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nmanure. Biogas is by far the most efficient\nuse of cattle dung. It improves the quality of\nmanure and also prevents the loss of trees\nand manure due to burning of fuel wood\nand cow dung cakes.\n\nad, — Ey, “9\n\nFig. 5.12: Biogas Plant\n\nTidal Energy\n\nOceanic tides can be used to generate\nelectricity. Floodgate dams are built across\ninlets. During high tide water flows into the\ninlet and gets trapped when the gate is closed.\nAfter the tide falls outside the flood gate, the\nwater retained by the floodgate flows back to\nthe sea via a pipe that carries it through a\npower -generating turbine.\n\nIn India the Gulf of Khambhat, the Gulf\nof Kuchchh in Gujarat on the western coast\nand Gangetic delta in Sunderban regions of\nWest Bengal provide ideal conditions for\nutilising tidal energy.\n\nGeo Thermal Energy\n\nGeo thermal energy refers to the heat and\nelectricity produced by using the heat from\nthe interior of the Earth. Geothermal energy\nexists because, the Earth grows progressively\nhotter with increasing depth. Where the\n\ngeothermal gradient is high, high temperatures\nare found at shallow depths. Groundwater in\nsuch areas absorbs heat from the rocks and\nbecomes hot. It is so hot that when it rises to\nthe earth’s surface, it turns into steam. This\nsteam is used to drive turbines and generate\nelectricity.\n\nThere are several hundred hot springs in\nIndia, which could be used to generate\nelectricity. Two experimental projects have been\nset up in India to harness geothermal energy.\nOne is located in the Parvati valley near\nManikaran in Himachal Pradesh and the other\nis located in the Puga Valley, Ladakh.\n\nConservation of Energy Resources\n\nEnergy is a basic requirement for economic\ndevelopment. Every sector of the national\neconomy — agriculture, industry, transport,\ncommercial and domestic — needs inputs of\nenergy. The economic development plans\nimplemented since Independence necessarily\nrequired increasing amounts of energy to\nremain operational. As aresult, consumption\nof energy in all forms has been steadily rising\nall over the country.\n\nIn this background, there is an urgent need\nto develop a sustainable path of energy\ndevelopment. Promotion of energy conservation\nand increased use of renewable energy sources\nare the twin planks of sustainable energy.\n\nIndia is presently one of the least energy\nefficient countries in the world. We have to\nadopt a cautious approach for the judicious\nuse of our limited energy resources. For\nexample, as concerned citizens we can do our\nbit by using public transport systems instead\nof individual vehicles; switching off electricity\nwhen not in use, using power-saving devices\nand using non-conventional sources of energy.\nAfter all, “energy saved is energy produced”.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

Where do these metals come from? You have studied that the earth’s crust is made up of different minerals embedded in the rocks. Various metals are extracted from these minerals after proper refinement. Minerals are an indispensable part of our lives. Almost everything we use, from a tiny pin to a towering building or a big ship, all are made from minerals. The railway lines and the tarmac (paving) of the roads, our implements and machinery too are made from minerals. Cars, buses, trains, aeroplanes are manufactured from minerals and run on power resources derived from the earth. Even the food that we eat contains minerals. In all stages of development, human beings have used minerals for their livelihood, decoration, festivities, religious and ceremonial rites. 1O68CHOS and minerals e A bright smile from toothpaste Toothpaste cleans your teeth. Abrasive minerals like silica, limestone, aluminium oxide and various phosphate minerals do the cleaning. Fluoride which is used to reduce cavities, comes from a mineral fluorite.

Geologists define mineral as a “homogenous, naturally occurring substance with a definable internal structure.” Minerals are found in varied forms in nature, ranging from the hardest diamond to the softest talc. Why are they so varied? Reprint 2O25-26 You have already learnt about rocks. Rocks are combinations of homogenous substances called minerals. Some rocks, for instance limestone, consist of a single mineral only, but majority of the rock consist of several minerals in varying proportions. Although, over 2OOO minerals have been identified, only a few are abundantly found in most of the rocks. A particular mineral that will be formed from a certain combination of elements depends upon the physical and chemical conditions under which the material forms. This, in turn, results in a wide range of colours, hardness, crystal forms, lustre and density that a particular mineral possesses. Geologists use these properties to classify the minerals. @- Study of Minerals by Geographers and Geologists Geographers study minerals as part of the ~ earth’s crust for a better understanding of landforms. The distribution of mineral resources and associated economic activities are of interest to geographers. A geologist, @ however, is interested in the formation of \\. minerals, their age and physical and chemical composition. However, for general and commercial purposes minerals can be classified as under. MopDE oF OCCURRENCE OF MINERALS Where are these minerals found? Minerals are usually found in “ores”. The term ore is used to describe an accumulation of any mineral mixed with other elements. The mineral content of the ore must be in sufficient concentration to make its extraction commercially viable. The type of formation or structure in which they are found determines the relative ease with which mineral ores may be mined. This also determines the cost of extraction. It is, therefore, important for us to understand the main types of formations in which minerals occur. Minerals generally occur in these forms: (i) In igneous and metamorphic rocks minerals may occur in the cracks, crevices, faults or joints. The smaller occurrences are called veins and the larger are called lodes. In most cases, they are formed when minerals in liquid/ molten and gaseous forms are forced upward through cavities towards the earth’s surface. They cool and solidify as they rise. Major metallic minerals like tin, copper, zinc and lead etc. are obtained from veins and lodes. (ii) In sedimentary rocks a number of minerals occur in beds or layers. They have been formed as a result of deposition, accumulation and concentration in horizontal strata. Coal and some forms of iron ore have been concentrated as a result of long periods under great heat and pressure. Another group of sedimentary minerals include gypsum, potash salt and sodium salt. These are formed as a result of evaporation especially in arid regions. (iii) Another mode of formation involves the decomposition of surface rocks, and the removal of soluble constituents, leaving a residual mass of weathered material containing ores. Bauxite is formed this way.

These deposits are called ‘placer deposits’ and generally contain minerals, which are not corroded by water. Gold, silver, tin and platinum are most important among such minerals. (v) The ocean waters contain vast quantities of minerals, but most of these are too widely diffused to be of economic significance. However, common salt, magnesium and bromine are largely derived from ocean waters. The ocean beds, too, are rich in g mhganese nodules. Interesting Fact Rat-Hole Mining. Do you know that most of the minerals in India are nationalised and their extraction is possible only after obtaining due permission from the government? But in most of the tribal areas of the north-east India, minerals are owned by individuals or communities. In Meghalaya, there are large deposits of coal, iron ore, limestone and dolomite etc. Coal mining in Jowai and Cherapunjee is done by family member in the form of a long narrow tunnel, known as ‘Rat hole’ mining. The National Green Tribunal has declared such activities illegal and recommended that these should be stopped forthwith. Dig a little deeper: What is the difference between an open pit mine, a quarry and an underground mine with shafts? India is fortunate to have fairly rich and varied mineral resources. However, these are unevenly distributed. Broadly speaking, peninsular rocks contain most of the reserves of coal, metallic minerals, mica and many other non-metallic minerals. Sedimentary rocks on the western and eastern flanks of the peninsula, in Gujarat and Assam have most of the petroleum deposits. Rajasthan with the rock systems of the peninsula, has reserves of many CONTEMPORARY INDIA — II non-ferrous minerals. The vast alluvial plains of north India are almost devoid of economic minerals. These variations exist largely because of the differences in the geological structure, processes and time involved in the formation of minerals. Let us now study the distribution of a few major minerals in India. Always remember that the concentration of mineral in the ore, the ease of extraction and closeness to the market play an important role in affecting the economic viability of a reserve. Thus, to meet the demand, a choice has to be made between a number of possible options. When this is done a mineral ‘deposit’ or ‘reserve’ turns into a mine. Ferrous Minerals Ferrous minerals account for about three- fourths of the total value of the production of metallic minerals. They provide a strong base for the development of metallurgical industries. India exports substantial quantities of ferrous minerals after meeting her internal demands. Iron Ore Iron ore is the basic mineral and the backbone of industrial development. India is endowed with fairly abundant resources of iron ore. India is rich in good quality iron ores. Magnetite is the finest iron ore with a very high content of iron up to 7O per cent. It has excellent magnetic qualities, especially valuable in the electrical industry. Hematite ore is the most important industrial iron ore in terms of the quantity used, but has a slightly lower iron content than magnetite. (5O-6O per cent). In 2O18-19 almost entire production of iron ore (97%) accrued from Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Jharkhand. The remaining production (3%) was from other states. Do you know? Kudre in Kannada means horse. The highest peak in the western ghats of Karnataka resembles the face of a horse. The Bailadila hills look like the hump of an ox, and hence its name. Reprint 2O25-26 Fig. 5.2: Iron ore mine The major iron ore belts in India are: Odisha-Jharkhand belt: In Odisha high grade hematite ore is found in Badampahar mines in the Mayurbhanj and Kendujhar districts. In the adjoining Singbhum district of Jnarkhand haematite iron ore is mined in Gua and Noamundi. Durg-Bastar-Chandrapur belt lies in Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. Very high grade hematites are found in the famous Bailadila range of hills in the Bastar district of Chhattisgarh. The range of hills comprise of 14 deposits of super high grade hematite iron ore. It has the best physical properties needed for steel making. Iron ore from these mines is exported to Japan and South Korea via Vishakhapatnam port. Ballari-Chitradurga-Chikkamagaluru- Tumakuru belt in Karnataka has large reserves of iron ore. The Kudremukh mines located in the Western Ghats of Karnataka are a 1OO per cent export unit. Kudremukh deposits are known to be one of the largest in the world. The ore is transported as slurry through a pipeline to a port near Mangaluru. Maharashtra-Goa belt includes the state of Goa and Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra. Though, the ores are not of very high quality, yet they are efficiently exploited. Iron ore is exported through Marmagao port. Manganese Manganese is mainly used in the manufacturing of steel and ferro-manganese alloy. Nearly 1O kg of manganese is required to manufacture one tonne of steel. It is also used in manufacturing bleaching powder, insecticides and paints.

Do you see any correlation. Why? Non-Ferrous Minerals India’s reserves and production of non- ferrous minerals is not very satisfactory. However, these minerals, which include copper, bauxite, lead, zinc and gold play a vital role in a number of metallurgical, engineering and electrical industries. Let us study the distribution of copper and bauxite.

Bauxite deposits are formed by the decomposition of a wide variety of rocks’ rich in aluminium silicates. Aluminium is an important metal because it combines the strength of metals such as iron, with extreme lightness and also with good conductivity and great malleability.

Interesting Fact After the discovery of aluminium Emperor Napoleon III wore buttons and hooks on his clothes made of aluminium and served food to his more illustrious guests in aluminium utensils and the Rock Minerals Limestone is found in association with rocks composed of calcium carbonates or calcium and magnesium carbonates. It is found in sedimentary rocks of most geological formations. Limestone is the basic raw material for the cement industry and less honourable ones were served in gold and silver utensils. Thirty years after this incident aluminium bowls were most common with the beggars in Paris. essential for smelting iron ore in the blast furnace. Dig a little deeper: Study the maps to explain why Chota Nagpur is a storehouse of minerals. Non-Metallic Minerals Mica is a mineral made up ofa series of plates or leaves. It splits easily into thin sheets. These sheets can be so thin that a thousand can be layered into a mica sheet of a few centimeters high. Mica can be clear, black, green, red yellow or brown. Due to its excellent di-electric strength, low power loss factor, insulating properties and resistance to high voltage, mica is one of the most indispensable minerals used in electric and electronic industries. Mica deposits are found in the northern edge of the Chota Nagpur plateau. Koderma Gaya — Hazaribagh belt of Jharkhand is the leading producer. In Rajasthan, the major mica producing area is around Ajmer. Nellore mica belt of Andhra Pradesh is also an important producer in the country.

What are the impacts of mining on the health of the miners and the environment? The dust and noxious fumes inhaled by miners make them vulnerable to pulmonary diseases. The risk of collapsing mine roofs, inundation and fires in coalmines are a constant threat to miners. The water sources in the region get contaminated due to mining. Dumping of waste and slurry leads to degradation of land, soil, and increase in stream and river pollution.

ANN Raa I ‘Over 5O% of coal-belt mines unsafe’ Law Kumar Mishra I Twn Dhanbad: Three days after one of the worst mining disasters in decades left 54 people dead, the chief of the company which owns these mines, said no less than half the mines in the area did not meet the basic safety standards. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd (BCCL) chair- man Partho § Bhattacharya, however, said on Saturday the company shouldn't be blamed for operating unsafe mines because workers and trade unions had blocked moves to shut these for fear of losing jobs. He said only one out of 41 mines was oper- ated scientifically and of the rest, the many were functioning against the advice of the Directorate General of Mines Safety. He de- scribed safety standards in 24 mines as poor. Bhattacharya said workers were aware that they would have to seek voluntary re- tirement if unsafe mines were shut. Bharat Coking Coal management on Sat- also handed over employment letters to the immediate people nominated by fam- ilies of victims. Ironically, these people, most likely, would go to work in mines deemed unsafe by the company.

At least 48 people were killed in explosions in Jeetpur mine, 43 in Sudamdeeh and 3O in implementation of environmental laws are essential to prevent mining from becoming a “killer industry”. CONSERVATION OF MINERALS We all appreciate the strong dependence of industry and agriculture upon mineral deposits and the substances manufactured from them. The total volume of workable mineral deposits is an insignificant fraction i.e. one per cent of the earth’s crust. We are rapidly consuming mineral resources that concentrated. The geological processes of mineral formation are so slow that the rates of replenishment are infinitely small in comparison to the present rates of consumption. Mineral resources are, therefore, finite and non-renewable. Rich mineral deposits are our country’s extremely valuable but short-lived possessions. Continued extraction of ores leads to increasing costs as mineral extraction comes from greater depths along with decrease @. in quality. MINERALS AND ENERGY RESOURCES Reprint 2O25-26 Aconcerted effort has to be made in order to use our mineral resources in a planned and sustainable manner. Improved technologies need to be constantly evolved to allow use of low grade ores at low costs. Recycling of metals, using scrap metals and other substitutes are steps in conserving our mineral resources for the future. Dig a little deeper: Make a list of items where substitutes are being used instead of minerals. Where are these substitutes obtained from? Energy Resources Energy is required for all activities. It is needed to cook, to provide light and heat, to propel vehicles and to drive machinery in industries. Energy can be generated from fuel minerals like coal, petroleum, natural gas, uranium and from electricity. Energy resources can be classified as conventional and non-conventional sources. Conventional sources include: firewood, cattle dung cake, coal, petroleum, natural gas and electricity (both hydel and thermal). Non-conventional sources include solar, wind, tidal, geothermal, biogas and atomic energy. Firewood and cattle dung cake are most common in rural India. According to one estimate more than 7O per cent energy requirement in rural households is met by these two ; continuation of these is increasingly becoming difficult due to decreasing forest area. Moreover, using dung cake too is being discouraged because it consumes most valuable manure which could be used in agriculture. Conventional Sources of Energy Coal: In India, coal is the most abundantly available fossil fuel. It provides a substantial part of the nation’s energy needs. It is used for power generation, to supply energy to industry as well as for domestic needs. India is highly dependent on coal for meeting its commercial energy requirements. As you are already aware that coal is formed due the compression of plant material over millions of years. Coal, therefore, is found in a variety of forms depending on the degrees of compression and the depth and CONTEMPORARY INDIA — II Fig. 5.9 (b): A view from outside of a coal mine time of burial. Decaying plants in swamps produce peat. Which has a low carbon and high moisture contents and low heating capacity. Lignite is a low grade brown coal, which is soft with high moisture content. The principal lignite reserves are in Neyveli in Tamil Nadu and are used for generation of electricity. Coal that has been buried deep and subjected to increased temperatures is bituminous coal. It is the most popular coal in commercial use. Metallurgical coal is high grade bituminous coal which has a special value for smelting iron in blast furnaces. Anthracite is the highest quality hard coal. In India coal occurs in rock series of two main geological ages, namely Gondwana, a little over 2OO million years in age and in tertiary deposits which are only about 55 million years old. The major resources of Gondwana coal, which are metallurgical coal, are located in Damodar valley (West Bengal- Reprint 2O25-26 68°E 12 AFGHANISTAN 36°N 36°N INDIA re.

MINERALS AND ENERGY RESOURCES Reprint 2O25-26 Jharkhand). Jharia, Raniganj, Bokaro are important coalfields. The Godavari, Mahanadi, Son and Wardha valleys also contain coal deposits. Tertiary coals occur in the north eastern states of Meghalaya, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland. Remember coal is a bulky material, which loses weight on use as it is reduced to ash. Hence, heavy industries and thermal power stations are located on or near the coalfields. Petroleum Petroleum or mineral oil is the next major energy source in India after coal. It provides fuel for heat and lighting, lubricants for machinery and raw materials for a number of manufacturing industries. Petroleum refineries act as a “nodal industry” for synthetic textile, fertiliser and numerous chemical industries. Most of the petroleum occurrences in India are associated with anticlines and fault traps in the rock formations of the tertiary age. In regions of folding, anticlines or domes, it occurs where oil is trapped in the crest of the upfold. The oil bearing layer is a porous limestone or sandstone through which oil may flow. The oil is prevented from rising or sinking by intervening non-porous layers. Petroleum is also found in fault traps between porous and non-porous rocks. Gas, being lighter usually occurs above the oil. Mumbai High, Gujarat and Assam are major petroleum production areas in India. From the map locate the 3 major off shore fields of western India. Ankeleshwar is the most important field of Gujarat. Assam is the oldest oil producing state of India. Digboi, Naharkatiya and Moran-Hugrijan are the important oil fields in the state. Natural Gas Natural Gas is found with petroleum deposits and is released when crude oil is brought to the surface. It can be used as a domestic and industrial fuel. It is used as fuel in power sector to generate electricity, for heating purpose in industries, as raw material in chemical, petrochemical and fertilizer industries, as transport fuel and as cooking fuel. With the expansion of gas infrastructure and local city CONTEMPORARY INDIA — II gas distribution (COD) networks, natural gas is also emerging as a preferred transport fuel (CNG) and cooking fuel (PNG) at homes. India’s major gas reserves are found in the Mumbai High and allied fields along the west coast which are supplemented by finds in the Cambay basin. Along the East Coast, new reserves of natural gas have been discovered in the Krishna-Godavari basin. The first 1,7OO km long Hazira-Vijaipur- Jagdishpur (HVJ) cross country gas pipeline, constructed by GAIL (India), linked Mumbai High and Bassein gas fields with various fertilizer, power and industrial complexes in western and northen India. This artery provided impetus to Indian gas market development. Overall, India’s gas infrastructure has expanded over ten times from 1,7OO km to 18,5OO km of cross-country pipelines and is expected to soon reach over 34, OOO km as Gas Grid by linking all gas sources and consuming markets across the country including North Eastern states. Electricity Electricity has such a wide range of applications in today’s world that, its percapita consumption is considered as an index of development. Electricity is generated mainly in two ways: by running water which drives hydro turbines to generate hydro electricity; and by burning other fuels such as coal, petroleum and natural gas to drive turbines to produce thermal power. Once generated the electricity is exactly the same. Activity Name some river valley projects and write the names of the dams built on these rivers. Hydro electricity is generated by fast flowing water, which is a renewable resource. India has a number of multi-purpose projects like the Bhakra Nangal, Damodar Valley corporation, the Kopili Hydel Project etc. producing hydroelectric power. Thermal electricity is generated by using coal, petroleum and natural gas. The thermal power stations use non-renewable fossil fuels for generating electricity.

Non-Conventional Sources of Energy The growing consumption of energy has resulted in the country becoming increasingly dependent on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. Rising prices of oil and gas and their potential shortages have raised uncertainties about the security of energy supply in future, which in turn has serious repercussions on the growth of the national economy. Moreover, increasing use of fossil fuels also causes serious environmental problems. Hence, there is a pressing need to use renewable energy sources like solar energy, wind, tide, biomass and energy from waste material. These are called non-conventional energy sources. India is blessed with an abundance of sunlight, water, wind and biomass. It has the largest programmes for the development of these renewable energy resources. Nuclear or Atomic Energy It is obtained by altering the structure of atoms. When such an alteration is made, much energy is released in the form of heat and this is used to generate electric power. Uranium and Thorium, which are available in Jharkhand and the Aravalli ranges of Rajasthan are used for generating atomic or nuclear power. The Monazite sands of Kerala is also rich in Thorium. Locate the 6 nuclear power stations and find out the state in which they are located. Solar Energy India is a tropical country. It has enormous possibilities of tapping solar energy. Photovoltaic technology converts sunlight directly into electricity. Solar energy is fast becoming popular in rural and remote areas. Some big solar power plants are being established in different parts of India which will minimise the dependence of rural households on firewood and dung cakes, which in turn will contribute to environmental conservation and adequate supply of manure in agriculture. CONTEMPORARY INDIA — II Fig. 5.1O: Solar operated electronic milk testing equipment Activity Collect information about newly established solar power plants in India. Wind power India has great potential of wind power. The largest wind farm cluster is located in Tamil Nadu from Nagarcoil to Madurai. Apart from these, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, Kerala, Maharashtra and Lakshadweep have important wind farms. Nagarcoil and Jaisalmer are well known for effective use of wind energy in the country. Fig. 5.11: Wind mills — Nagarcoil Biogas Shrubs, farm waste, animal and human waste are used to produce biogas for domestic consumption in rural areas. Decomposition of organic matter yields gas, which has higher thermal efficiency in comparison to kerosene, dung cake and charcoal. Biogas plants are set up at municipal, cooperative and individual levels. The plants using cattle dung are known as ‘Gobar gas plants’ in rural India. These provide twin benefits to the farmer in the form of energy and improved quality of Reprint 2O25-26 manure. Biogas is by far the most efficient use of cattle dung. It improves the quality of manure and also prevents the loss of trees and manure due to burning of fuel wood and cow dung cakes. ad, — Ey, “9 Fig. 5.12: Biogas Plant Tidal Energy Oceanic tides can be used to generate electricity. Floodgate dams are built across inlets. During high tide water flows into the inlet and gets trapped when the gate is closed. After the tide falls outside the flood gate, the water retained by the floodgate flows back to the sea via a pipe that carries it through a power -generating turbine. In India the Gulf of Khambhat, the Gulf of Kuchchh in Gujarat on the western coast and Gangetic delta in Sunderban regions of West Bengal provide ideal conditions for utilising tidal energy. Geo Thermal Energy Geo thermal energy refers to the heat and electricity produced by using the heat from the interior of the Earth. Geothermal energy exists because, the Earth grows progressively hotter with increasing depth. Where the geothermal gradient is high, high temperatures are found at shallow depths. Groundwater in such areas absorbs heat from the rocks and becomes hot. It is so hot that when it rises to the earth’s surface, it turns into steam. This steam is used to drive turbines and generate electricity. There are several hundred hot springs in India, which could be used to generate electricity. Two experimental projects have been set up in India to harness geothermal energy. One is located in the Parvati valley near Manikaran in Himachal Pradesh and the other is located in the Puga Valley, Ladakh. Conservation of Energy Resources Energy is a basic requirement for economic development. Every sector of the national economy — agriculture, industry, transport, commercial and domestic — needs inputs of energy. The economic development plans implemented since Independence necessarily required increasing amounts of energy to remain operational. As aresult, consumption of energy in all forms has been steadily rising all over the country. In this background, there is an urgent need to develop a sustainable path of energy development. Promotion of energy conservation and increased use of renewable energy sources are the twin planks of sustainable energy. India is presently one of the least energy efficient countries in the world. We have to adopt a cautious approach for the judicious use of our limited energy resources. For example, as concerned citizens we can do our bit by using public transport systems instead of individual vehicles; switching off electricity when not in use, using power-saving devices and using non-conventional sources of energy. After all, “energy saved is energy produced”. EXERCISES 1. Multiple choice questions.

Almost everything we use, from a tiny pin\nto a towering building or a big ship, all are\nmade from minerals. The railway lines and the\ntarmac (paving) of the roads, our implements\nand machinery too are made from minerals.\nCars, buses, trains, aeroplanes are\nmanufactured from minerals and run on\npower resources derived from the earth. Even\nthe food that we eat contains minerals. In all\nstages of development, human beings have\nused minerals for their livelihood, decoration,\nfestivities, religious and ceremonial rites.\n\n1068CHOS\n\nand minerals\n\ne\nA bright smile from toothpaste\n\nToothpaste cleans your teeth. Abrasive\nminerals like silica, limestone, aluminium\noxide and various phosphate minerals do the\ncleaning. Fluoride which is used to reduce\ncavities, comes from a mineral fluorite. Most\ntoothpaste are made white with titanium\noxide, which comes from minerals called\nrutile, ilmenite and anatase. The sparkle in\nsome toothpastes comes from mica. The\n®@ toothbrush and tube containing the paste are\n\nmade of plastics from petroleum.

          "text": "You have already learnt about rocks.\nRocks are combinations of homogenous\nsubstances called minerals. Some rocks, for\ninstance limestone, consist of a single mineral\nonly, but majority of the rock consist of several\nminerals in varying proportions. Although,\nover 2000 minerals have been identified, only\na few are abundantly found in most of the\nrocks.\n\nA particular mineral that will be formed\nfrom a certain combination of elements\ndepends upon the physical and chemical\nconditions under which the material forms.\nThis, in turn, results in a wide range of colours,\nhardness, crystal forms, lustre and density that\na particular mineral possesses. Geologists use\nthese properties to classify the minerals.\n\n@-\nStudy of Minerals by Geographers\nand Geologists\n\nGeographers study minerals as part of the ~\nearth’s crust for a better understanding of\nlandforms. The distribution of mineral\nresources and associated economic activities\nare of interest to geographers. A geologist,\n@ however, is interested in the formation of\n\\. minerals, their age and physical and\nchemical composition.\nHowever, for general and commercial\npurposes minerals can be classified as under.\n\nMopDE oF OCCURRENCE OF MINERALS\n\nWhere are these minerals found?\n\nMinerals are usually found in “ores”. The\nterm ore is used to describe an accumulation\nof any mineral mixed with other elements.\nThe mineral content of the ore must be in\n\nsufficient concentration to make its extraction\ncommercially viable. The type of formation or\nstructure in which they are found determines\nthe relative ease with which mineral ores may\nbe mined. This also determines the cost of\nextraction. It is, therefore, important for us\nto understand the main types of formations\nin which minerals occur.\nMinerals generally occur in these forms:\n\n(i) In igneous and metamorphic rocks\nminerals may occur in the cracks,\ncrevices, faults or joints. The smaller\noccurrences are called veins and the\nlarger are called lodes. In most cases,\nthey are formed when minerals in liquid/\nmolten and gaseous forms are forced\nupward through cavities towards the\nearth’s surface. They cool and solidify as\nthey rise. Major metallic minerals like tin,\ncopper, zinc and lead etc. are obtained\nfrom veins and lodes.\n\n(ii) In sedimentary rocks a number of minerals\noccur in beds or layers. They have been\nformed as a result of deposition,\naccumulation and concentration in\nhorizontal strata. Coal and some forms of\niron ore have been concentrated as a result\nof long periods under great heat and\npressure. Another group of sedimentary\nminerals include gypsum, potash salt and\nsodium salt. These are formed as a result\nof evaporation especially in arid regions.\n\n(iii) Another mode of formation involves the\ndecomposition of surface rocks, and the\nremoval of soluble constituents, leaving\na residual mass of weathered\nmaterial containing ores. Bauxite is\nformed this way.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS\n\nMinerals\n\n' a Te”\n\nMetallic\n\nFerrous (containing Non-Ferrous\niron) e.g. iron ore, e.g. copper, lead,\nManganese, nickel __ tin, bauxite, etc.\ncobalt, etc.\n\nFig. 5.1\n\nPrecious\ne.g. gold, silver,\nplatinum, etc.\n\nNon-Metallic Energy Minerals\n\ne.g. mica, salt, Coal\npotash, sulphur, Petroleum\ngranite, limestone, Natural gas\n\nmarble, sandstone, etc.\n\nMINERALS AND ENERGY RESOURCES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

These deposits are called\n‘placer deposits’ and generally contain\nminerals, which are not corroded by water.\nGold, silver, tin and platinum are most\nimportant among such minerals.\n\n(v) The ocean waters contain vast quantities\nof minerals, but most of these are too widely\ndiffused to be of economic significance.\nHowever, common salt, magnesium and\nbromine are largely derived from ocean\nwaters. The ocean beds, too, are rich in\n\ng mhganese nodules.\n\nInteresting Fact\n\nRat-Hole Mining. Do you know that most\nof the minerals in India are nationalised\nand their extraction is possible only after\nobtaining due permission from the\ngovernment? But in most of the tribal\nareas of the north-east India, minerals are\nowned by individuals or communities. In\nMeghalaya, there are large deposits of coal,\niron ore, limestone and dolomite etc. Coal\nmining in Jowai and Cherapunjee is done\nby family member in the form of a long\nnarrow tunnel, known as ‘Rat hole’\nmining. The National Green Tribunal has\ndeclared such activities illegal and\nrecommended that these should be\nstopped forthwith.\n\nDig a little deeper: What is the difference\nbetween an open pit mine, a quarry and an\nunderground mine with shafts?\n\nIndia is fortunate to have fairly rich and\nvaried mineral resources. However, these are\nunevenly distributed. Broadly speaking,\npeninsular rocks contain most of the reserves\nof coal, metallic minerals, mica and many other\nnon-metallic minerals. Sedimentary rocks on\nthe western and eastern flanks of the peninsula,\nin Gujarat and Assam have most of the\npetroleum deposits. Rajasthan with the rock\nsystems of the peninsula, has reserves of many\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nnon-ferrous minerals. The vast alluvial plains\nof north India are almost devoid of economic\nminerals. These variations exist largely because\nof the differences in the geological structure,\nprocesses and time involved in the formation\nof minerals.\n\nLet us now study the distribution of a few\nmajor minerals in India. Always remember that\nthe concentration of mineral in the ore, the ease\nof extraction and closeness to the market play\nan important role in affecting the economic\nviability of a reserve. Thus, to meet the demand,\na choice has to be made between a number of\npossible options. When this is done a mineral\n‘deposit’ or ‘reserve’ turns into a mine.\n\nFerrous Minerals\n\nFerrous minerals account for about three-\nfourths of the total value of the production of\nmetallic minerals. They provide a strong base\nfor the development of metallurgical industries.\nIndia exports substantial quantities of ferrous\nminerals after meeting her internal demands.\n\nIron Ore\n\nIron ore is the basic mineral and the backbone\nof industrial development. India is endowed\nwith fairly abundant resources of iron ore. India\nis rich in good quality iron ores. Magnetite is\nthe finest iron ore with a very high content of\niron up to 70 per cent. It has excellent magnetic\nqualities, especially valuable in the electrical\nindustry. Hematite ore is the most important\nindustrial iron ore in terms of the quantity\nused, but has a slightly lower iron content than\nmagnetite. (50-60 per cent). In 2018-19 almost\nentire production of iron ore (97%) accrued\nfrom Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and\nJharkhand. The remaining production (3%)\nwas from other states.\n\nDo you know?\n\nKudre in Kannada means horse. The\nhighest peak in the western ghats of\nKarnataka resembles the face of a horse.\nThe Bailadila hills look like the hump of\nan ox, and hence its name.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

The Godavari,\nMahanadi, Son and Wardha valleys also\ncontain coal deposits.\n\nTertiary coals occur in the north eastern\nstates of Meghalaya, Assam, Arunachal\nPradesh and Nagaland.\n\nRemember coal is a bulky material, which\nloses weight on use as it is reduced to ash.\nHence, heavy industries and thermal power\nstations are located on or near the coalfields.\n\nPetroleum\n\nPetroleum or mineral oil is the next major\nenergy source in India after coal. It provides\nfuel for heat and lighting, lubricants for\nmachinery and raw materials for a number of\nmanufacturing industries. Petroleum refineries\nact as a “nodal industry” for synthetic textile,\nfertiliser and numerous chemical industries.\n\nMost of the petroleum occurrences in India\nare associated with anticlines and fault traps\nin the rock formations of the tertiary age. In\nregions of folding, anticlines or domes, it\noccurs where oil is trapped in the crest of the\nupfold. The oil bearing layer is a porous\nlimestone or sandstone through which oil may\nflow. The oil is prevented from rising or\nsinking by intervening non-porous layers.\n\nPetroleum is also found in fault traps\nbetween porous and non-porous rocks. Gas,\nbeing lighter usually occurs above the oil.\n\nMumbai High, Gujarat and Assam are\n\nmajor petroleum production areas in India.\nFrom the map locate the 3 major off shore\nfields of western India. Ankeleshwar is the\nmost important field of Gujarat. Assam is the\noldest oil producing state of India. Digboi,\nNaharkatiya and Moran-Hugrijan are the\nimportant oil fields in the state.\n\nNatural Gas\n\nNatural Gas is found with petroleum deposits\nand is released when crude oil is brought to\nthe surface. It can be used as a domestic and\nindustrial fuel. It is used as fuel in power sector\nto generate electricity, for heating purpose in\nindustries, as raw material in chemical,\npetrochemical and fertilizer industries, as\ntransport fuel and as cooking fuel. With the\nexpansion of gas infrastructure and local city\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\ngas distribution (COD) networks, natural gas\nis also emerging as a preferred transport fuel\n(CNG) and cooking fuel (PNG) at homes. India’s\nmajor gas reserves are found in the Mumbai\nHigh and allied fields along the west coast\nwhich are supplemented by finds in the\nCambay basin. Along the East Coast, new\nreserves of natural gas have been discovered\nin the Krishna-Godavari basin.\n\nThe first 1,700 km long Hazira-Vijaipur-\nJagdishpur (HVJ) cross country gas pipeline,\nconstructed by GAIL (India), linked Mumbai\nHigh and Bassein gas fields with various\nfertilizer, power and industrial complexes in\nwestern and northen India. This artery\nprovided impetus to Indian gas market\ndevelopment. Overall, India’s gas infrastructure\nhas expanded over ten times from 1,700 km\nto 18,500 km of cross-country pipelines and\nis expected to soon reach over 34, 000 km as\nGas Grid by linking all gas sources and\nconsuming markets across the country\nincluding North Eastern states.\n\nElectricity\n\nElectricity has such a wide range of\napplications in today’s world that, its percapita\nconsumption is considered as an index of\ndevelopment. Electricity is generated mainly in\ntwo ways: by running water which drives hydro\nturbines to generate hydro electricity; and by\nburning other fuels such as coal, petroleum\nand natural gas to drive turbines to produce\nthermal power. Once generated the electricity\nis exactly the same.\n\nActivity\nName some river valley projects and write\nthe names of the dams built on these rivers.\n\nHydro electricity is generated by fast\nflowing water, which is a renewable resource.\nIndia has a number of multi-purpose projects\nlike the Bhakra Nangal, Damodar Valley\ncorporation, the Kopili Hydel Project etc.\nproducing hydroelectric power.\n\nThermal electricity is generated by using\ncoal, petroleum and natural gas. The thermal\npower stations use non-renewable fossil fuels\nfor generating electricity.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

Show\nthem on the map of India.\n\nNon-Conventional Sources of Energy\n\nThe growing consumption of energy has\nresulted in the country becoming increasingly\ndependent on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and\ngas. Rising prices of oil and gas and their\npotential shortages have raised uncertainties\nabout the security of energy supply in future,\nwhich in turn has serious repercussions on the\ngrowth of the national economy. Moreover,\nincreasing use of fossil fuels also causes\nserious environmental problems. Hence, there\nis a pressing need to use renewable energy\nsources like solar energy, wind, tide, biomass\nand energy from waste material. These are\ncalled non-conventional energy sources.\n\nIndia is blessed with an abundance of\nsunlight, water, wind and biomass. It has the\nlargest programmes for the development of\nthese renewable energy resources.\n\nNuclear or Atomic Energy\n\nIt is obtained by altering the structure of\natoms. When such an alteration is made, much\nenergy is released in the form of heat and this\nis used to generate electric power. Uranium and\nThorium, which are available in Jharkhand and\nthe Aravalli ranges of Rajasthan are used for\ngenerating atomic or nuclear power. The\nMonazite sands of Kerala is also rich in\nThorium.\n\nLocate the 6 nuclear power stations and find\nout the state in which they are located.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nIndia is a tropical country. It has enormous\npossibilities of tapping solar energy.\nPhotovoltaic technology converts sunlight\ndirectly into electricity. Solar energy is fast\nbecoming popular in rural and remote areas.\nSome big solar power plants are being\nestablished in different parts of India which\nwill minimise the dependence of rural\nhouseholds on firewood and dung cakes,\nwhich in turn will contribute to environmental\nconservation and adequate supply of manure\nin agriculture.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig. 5.10: Solar operated electronic milk\ntesting equipment\n\nActivity\n\nCollect information about newly established\n\nsolar power plants in India.\n\nWind power\n\nIndia has great potential of wind power. The\nlargest wind farm cluster is located in Tamil\nNadu from Nagarcoil to Madurai. Apart from\nthese, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat,\nKerala, Maharashtra and Lakshadweep have\nimportant wind farms. Nagarcoil and\nJaisalmer are well known for effective use of\nwind energy in the country.\n\nFig. 5.11: Wind mills — Nagarcoil\n\nBiogas\n\nShrubs, farm waste, animal and human waste\nare used to produce biogas for domestic\nconsumption in rural areas. Decomposition\nof organic matter yields gas, which has higher\nthermal efficiency in comparison to kerosene,\ndung cake and charcoal.

It improves the quality of\nmanure and also prevents the loss of trees\nand manure due to burning of fuel wood\nand cow dung cakes.\n\nad, — Ey, “9\n\nFig. 5.12: Biogas Plant\n\nTidal Energy\n\nOceanic tides can be used to generate\nelectricity. Floodgate dams are built across\ninlets. During high tide water flows into the\ninlet and gets trapped when the gate is closed.\nAfter the tide falls outside the flood gate, the\nwater retained by the floodgate flows back to\nthe sea via a pipe that carries it through a\npower -generating turbine.\n\nIn India the Gulf of Khambhat, the Gulf\nof Kuchchh in Gujarat on the western coast\nand Gangetic delta in Sunderban regions of\nWest Bengal provide ideal conditions for\nutilising tidal energy.\n\nGeo Thermal Energy\n\nGeo thermal energy refers to the heat and\nelectricity produced by using the heat from\nthe interior of the Earth. Geothermal energy\nexists because, the Earth grows progressively\nhotter with increasing depth. Where the\n\ngeothermal gradient is high, high temperatures\nare found at shallow depths. Groundwater in\nsuch areas absorbs heat from the rocks and\nbecomes hot. It is so hot that when it rises to\nthe earth’s surface, it turns into steam. This\nsteam is used to drive turbines and generate\nelectricity.\n\nThere are several hundred hot springs in\nIndia, which could be used to generate\nelectricity. Two experimental projects have been\nset up in India to harness geothermal energy.\nOne is located in the Parvati valley near\nManikaran in Himachal Pradesh and the other\nis located in the Puga Valley, Ladakh.\n\nConservation of Energy Resources\n\nEnergy is a basic requirement for economic\ndevelopment. Every sector of the national\neconomy — agriculture, industry, transport,\ncommercial and domestic — needs inputs of\nenergy. The economic development plans\nimplemented since Independence necessarily\nrequired increasing amounts of energy to\nremain operational. As aresult, consumption\nof energy in all forms has been steadily rising\nall over the country.\n\nIn this background, there is an urgent need\nto develop a sustainable path of energy\ndevelopment. Promotion of energy conservation\nand increased use of renewable energy sources\nare the twin planks of sustainable energy.\n\nIndia is presently one of the least energy\nefficient countries in the world. We have to\nadopt a cautious approach for the judicious\nuse of our limited energy resources. For\nexample, as concerned citizens we can do our\nbit by using public transport systems instead\nof individual vehicles; switching off electricity\nwhen not in use, using power-saving devices\nand using non-conventional sources of energy.\nAfter all, “energy saved is energy produced”.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

    "original_text": "1068CHO6\n\nMANUFACTURING INVUSTKIES\n\nOn the occassion of Diwali, Harish went to\na market with his parents. They purchased\nshoes and clothes for him. His mother ~\npurchased utensils, sugar, tea and diyas\n(earthen lamps). Harish observed that the\nshops in the market were flooded with\nitems for sale. He wondered how so many\nitems could be made in such large\nquantities. His father explained that shoes,\nclothes, sugar etc. are manufactured by\nmachines in large industries, some utensils\nare manufactured in small industries, while\nitems like diyas are made by individual\nartisans in household industry.\n\nDo you have some ideas about these\nindustries?\n\nProduction of goods in large quantities after\nprocessing from raw materials to more\nvaluable products is called manufacturing. Do\nyou know that paper is manufactured from\nwood, sugar from sugarcane, iron and steel\nfrom iron ore and aluminium from bauxite?\nDo you also know that some types of clothes\nare manufactured from yarn which itself is an\nindustrial product?\n\nPeople employed in the secondary activities\nmanufacture the primary materials into\nfinished goods. The workers employed in steel\nfactories, car, breweries, textile industries,\nbakeries etc. fall into this category. Some people\nare employed in providing services. In this\nchapter, we are mainly concerned with\nmanufacturing industries which fall in the\nsecondary sector.\n\nThe economic strength of a country is\nmeasured by the development of\nmanufacturing industries.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF MANUFACTURING\n\nManufacturing sector is considered the backbone\nof development in general and economic\ndevelopment in particular mainly because-\n\ne Manufacturing industries not only help in\nmodernising agriculture, which forms the\nbackbone of our economy, they also reduce\nthe heavy dependence of people on\nagricultural income by providing them jobs\nin secondary and tertiary sectors.\n\n¢ Industrial development is a precondition for\neradication of unemployment and poverty\nfrom our country. This was the main\nphilosophy behind public sector industries\nand joint sector ventures in India. It was also\naimed at bringing down regional disparities\nby establishing industries in tribal and\nbackward areas.\n\ne Export of manufactured goods expands\ntrade and commerce, and brings in much\nneeded foreign exchange.\n\n¢ Countries that transform their raw\nmaterials into a wide variety of finished\ngoods of higher value are prosperous.\nIndia’s prosperity lies in increasing and\ndiversifying its manufacturing industries as\nquickly as possible.\n\nAgriculture and industry are not exclusive\nof each other. They move hand in hand. For\ninstance, the agro-industries in India have\ngiven a major boost to agriculture by raising\nits productivity. They depend on the latter for\nraw materials and sell their products such as\nirrigation pumps, fertilisers, insecticides,\npesticides, plastic and PVC pipes, machines\nand tools, etc. to the farmers. Thus,\ndevelopment and competitiveness of\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nmanufacturing industry has not only\nassisted agriculturists in increasing their\nproduction but also made the production\nprocesses very efficient.\n\nIn the present day world of globalisation,\nour industry needs to be more efficient and\ncompetitive. Self-sufficiency alone is not\nenough. Our manufactured goods must be\nat par in quality with those in the\ninternational market. Only then, will we be\nable to compete in the international market.\n\nClassification of Industries\n\nList the various manufactured products you\nuse in your daily life such as — transistors,\nelectric bulbs, vegetable oil, cement,\nglassware, petrol, matches, scooters,\nautomobiles, medicines and so on. If we\nclassify the various industries based on a\nparticular criterion then we would be\nable to understand their manufacturing\nbetter. Industries may be classified as\nfollows:\n\nOn the basis of source of raw materials\nused:\n\n¢ Agro based: cotton, woollen, jute, silk\ntextile, rubber and sugar, tea, coffee,\nedible oil.\n\ne Mineral based: iron and steel, cement,\naluminium, machine tools,\npetrochemicals.\n\nAccording to their main role:\n\n¢ Basic or key industries are those which\nsupply their products as raw materials to\nmanufacture other goods e.g. iron and\nsteel and copper smelting, aluminum\nsmelting.\n\n¢ Consumer industries that produce goods\nfor direct use by consumers — sugar,\ntoothpaste, paper, sewing machines,\n\nallowed on the assets of a unit. This limit\nhas changed over a period of time. At\npresent the maximum investment allowed\nis rupees one crore.\n\nOn the basis of ownership:\n\n¢ Public sector, owned and operated by\ngovernment agencies — BHEL, SAIL etc.\n\n¢ Private sector industries owned and\noperated by individuals or a group of\nindividuals -TISCO, Bajaj Auto Ltd.,\nDabur Industries.\n\nJoint sector industries which are jointly run\nby the state and individuals or a group of\nindividuals. Oil India Ltd. (OIL) is jointly\nowned by public and private sector.\n\n* Cooperative sector industries are owned\nand operated by the producers or\nsuppliers of raw materials, workers or\nboth. They pool in the resources and share\nthe profits or losses proportionately. Such\nexamples are the sugar industry in\nMaharashtra, the coir industry in Kerala.\n\nBased on the bulk and weight of raw material\nand finished goods:\n\n¢ Heavy industries such as iron and steel\n\ne ° Light industries that use light raw\n\nmaterials and produce light goods such\nas electrical goods industries.\n\nActivity\n\nClassify the following into two groups on the\nbasis of bulk and weight of raw material and\nfinished goods.\n\n(i) Oil (vi) Sewing Machines\n(ii) Knitting needles (vii) Shipbuilding\n(iii) Brassware (viii) Electric Bulbs\n(iv) Fuse wires (ix) Paint brushes\n(v) Watches (x) Automobiles\n\nfans etc. Agro-based Industries\nOn the basis of capital investment: Cotton, jute, silk, woollen textiles, sugar and\n¢ A small scale industry is defined with edible oil, etc. industries are based on\nreference to the maximum investment agricultural raw materials.\n\nMANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES 59\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nFibre\n\nSpinnin\nProduction P  ™\n\nWeaving\nKnitting\n\nDyeing and —> Garment\nFinishing <— manufacture\n\nRaw fibre i Yarn - Fabric ; Garments i\n\nFig. 6.1:\n\nTextile Industry: The textile industry\noccupies unique position in the Indian\neconomy, because it contributes significantly\nto industrial production, employment\ngeneration and foreign exchange earnings. It\nis the only industry in the country, which is\nself-reliant and complete in the value chain\ni.e., from raw material to the highest value\nadded products.\n\nCotton Textiles: In ancient India, cotton\ntextiles were produced with hand spinning\nand handloom weaving techniques. After\nthe 18\" century, power-looms came into\nuse. Our traditional industries suffered a\nsetback during the colonial period because\nthey could not compete with the mill-made\ncloth from England.\n\n* The first successful textile mill was (\n\nestablished in Mumbai in 1854.\n\n¢ The two world wars were fought in Europe,\n\nIndia was a British colony. There was a\n\ne demand for cloth in U.K. hence, they gave\n\na boost to the development of the cotton\ntextile industry.\n\nIn the early years, the cotton textile\nindustry was concentrated in the cotton\ngrowing belt of Maharashtra and Gujarat.\nAvailability of raw cotton, market, transport\nincluding accessible port facilities, labour,\nmoist climate, etc. contributed towards its\nlocalisation. This industry has close links\nwith agriculture and provides a living to\nfarmers, cotton boll pluckers and workers\nengaged in ginning, spinning, weaving,\n\n)\n\nValue addition in the textile industry\n\ndyeing, designing, packaging, tailoring and\nsewing. The industry by creating demands\nsupports many other industries, such as,\nchemicals and dyes, packaging materials\nand engineering works.\n\nWhile spinning continues to be centralised\nin Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu,\nweaving is highly decentralised to provide\nscope for incorporating traditional skills and\ndesigns of weaving in cotton, silk, zari,\nembroidery, etc. India has world class\nproduction in spinning, but weaving supplies\nlow quality of fabric as it cannot use much of\nthe high quality yarn produced in the country.\nWeaving is done by handloom, powerloom and\nin mills.\n\nThe handspun khadi provides large scale\nemployment to weavers in their homes as a\ncottage industry.\n\nWhy did Mahatma Gandhi lay emphasis on\nspinning yarn and weaving khadi?\n\nWhy is it important for our country to\nkeep the mill sector loomage lower than\npower loom and handloom?\n\nJute Textiles\n\nIndia is the largest producer of raw jute and\njute goods and stands at second place as an\nexporter after Bangladesh. Most of the mills are\nlocated in West Bengal, mainly along the banks\nof the Hugli river, in a narrow belt.\n\nThe first jute mill was set up near Kolkata in\n1855 at Rishra. After Partition in 1947, the ‘\njute mills remained in India but three-fourth ~\nof the jute producing area went to\nBangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan).\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\n68°E 12\n\nAFGHANISTAN\n36°N\n\nRa Baramula\n\n( f @=.Srinagar\n\neS abaninng :\n“*\n\nPAKISTAN (\n° Ss Tew\n32 Lye aay\n\nGo Airisar ;\n7 Cuchi\"\n\nMysay\n\nPanipat @ Moradabgé\n\ne Gurugram ®, s ee\n\nBikaner ‘a Agra\n\nJaipur®\nwate ;\n\ndid\n\ntet eden cent eweemneveswes sanity cc ‘\nwtsserereneaspece.\n\nRe 7 E Pepys Bankura ff\n\ne\nVerisidara Indore\n\n‘oho es\n® Wardha\n@ Aurangabad _ :\n\nARABIAN\nSEA\n\n® Pune\n\n16°\n\nLAKSHADWEEP\n(INDIA)\n\nINDIAN\n°F\n\nIndia: Distribution of cotton, woollen and silk industries\n\noe |.\n29e Shahjahanpur“+~.+-\n\n@@Kanpur =>\nVaranasi B | a ae *\n\nINDIA\nTEXTILE INDUSTRIES\n\n)\n\nCHINA\n( I 1B BT )\n\n. i\n\na -—~ -<° Dot Sl se\nLe BHUTAN 3... ./ oe\nNand Su, q ,\n\n\\\n\n7 ? 5 ~~\nMeet OC, \"a a Ss\n\n\"urshidabéd —.\n\n: Tropic of Cancer\n\n*“ Haora\nseh Seas\n\n@ COTTON TEXTILE\n@ WOOLLEN TEXTILE\nf SILK TEXTILE\n\nMANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nFactors responsible for their location in the\nHugli basin are: proximity of the jute producing\nareas, inexpensive water transport, supported\nby a good network of railways, roadways and\nwaterways to facilitate movement of raw\nmaterial to the mills, abundant water for\nprocessing raw jute, cheap labour from West\nBengal and adjoining states of Bihar, Odisha\nand Uttar Pradesh. Kolkata as a large urban\ncentre provides banking, insurance and port\nfacilities for export of jute goods.\n\nSugar Industry\n\nIndia stands second as a world producer of\nsugar but occupies the first place in the\nproduction of gur and khandsari. The raw\nmaterial used in this industry is bulky, and in\nhaulage its sucrose content reduces. The mills\nare located in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,\nMaharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra\nPradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana and\nMadhya Pradesh. Sixty per cent mills are in\nUttar Pradesh and Bihar. This industry is\nseasonal in nature so, it is ideally suited to the\ncooperative sector. Can you explain why this\nis so?\n\nIn recent years, there is a tendency for the\nmills to shift and concentrate in the southern\nand western states, especially in Maharashtra,\nThis is because the cane produced here has a\nhigher sucrose content. The cooler climate also\nensures a longer crushing season. Moreover,\nthe cooperatives are more successful in these\n\nMineral-based Industries\n\nIndustries that use minerals and metals as raw\nmaterials are called mineral-based industries.\nCan you name some industries that would fall\nin this category?\n\nIron and Steel Industry\n\nThe iron and steel industry is the basic industry\nsince all the other industries — heavy, medium\nand light, depend on it for their machinery.\nSteel is needed to manufacture a variety of\nengineering goods, construction material,\ndefence, medical, telephonic, scientific\nequipment and a variety of consumer goods.\n\nActivity\nMake a list of all such goods made of steel\nthat you can think of.\n\nProduction and consumption of steel is\noften regarded as the index of a country’s\ndevelopment. Iron and steel is a heavy industry\nbecause all the raw materials as well as\nfinished goods are heavy and bulky entailing\nheavy transportation costs. Iron ore, coking\ncoal and lime stone are required in the ratio of\napproximately 4 : 2: 1. Some quantities of\nmanganese, are also required to harden the\nsteel.

The third, i.e. potash is\nentirely imported as the country does not have\nany reserves of commercially usable potash or\npotassium compounds in any form.\n\nAfter the Green Revolution the industry\nexpanded to several other parts of the country.\nGujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and\nKerala contribute towards half of the fertilizer\nproduction. Other significant producers are\nAndhra Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Bihar,\nMaharashtra, Assam, West Bengal, Goa, Delhi,\nMadhya Pradesh and Karnataka.\n\nCement Industry\n\nCement is essential for construction activity\nsuch as building houses, factories, bridges,\nroads, airports, dams and for other commercial\nestablishments. This industry requires bulky\nand heavy raw materials like limestone, silica\nand gypsum. Coal and electric power are\nneeded apart from rail transportation.\n\nActivity\n\nWhere would it be economically viable to\n\nset up the cement manufacturing units?\n\nThe industry has strategically located\nplants in Gujarat that have suitable access to\nthe market in the Gulf countries.\n\nActivity\nFind out where the plants are located in other\nStates of India.

Air-\nborne particulate materials contain both solid\nand liquid particles like dust, sprays mist and\nsmoke. Smoke is emitted by chemical and\npaper factories, brick kilns, refineries and\nsmelting plants, and burning of fossil fuels in\nbig and small factories that ignore pollution\nnorms. Toxic gas leaks can be very hazardous\nwith long-term effects. Are you aware of the\nBhopal Gas tragedy that occurred? Air\npollution adversely affects human health,\nanimals, plants, buildings and the atmosphere\nas a whole.\n\nWater pollution is caused by organic and\ninorganic industrial wastes and affluents\ndischarged into rivers. The main culprits in this\nregard are paper, pulp, chemical, textile and\ndyeing, petroleum refineries, tanneries and\nelectroplating industries that let out dyes,\ndetergents, acids, salts and heavy metals like\nlead and mercury pesticides, fertilisers,\nsynthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and\nrubber, etc. into the water bodies. Fly ash,\nphospo- gypsum and iron and steel slags are\nthe major solid wastes in India.\n\nThermal pollution of water occurs when hot\nwater from factories and thermal plants is\ndrained into rivers and ponds before cooling.\nWhat would be the effect on aquatic life?\nWastes from nuclear power plants, nuclear\nand weapon production facilities cause\ncancers, birth defects and miscarriages. Soil\nand water pollution are closely related.\n\nDumping of wastes specially glass, harmful\nchemicals, industrial effluents, packaging, salts\nand garbage renders the soil useless. Rain\nwater percolates to the soil carrying the\npollutants to the ground and the ground water\nalso gets contaminated.\n\nNoise pollution not only results in irritation\nand anger, it can also cause hearing\nimpairment, increased heart rate and blood\npressure among other physiological effects.\nUnwanted sound is an irritant and a source of\nstress. Industrial and construction activities,\nmachinery, factory equipment, generators,\nsaws and pneumatic and electric drills also\nmake a lot of noise.\n\nControl of Environmental Degradation\n\nEvery litre of waste water discharged by our\nindustry pollutes eight times the quantity of\nfreshwater. How can the industrial pollution of\nfresh water be reduced? Some suggestions are-\n(i) minimising use water for processing by\nreusing and recycling it in two or more\nsuccessive stages\n\n(ii) harvesting of rainwater to meet water\nrequirements\n\n(iii) treating hot water and effluents before\nreleasing them in rivers and ponds.\nTreatment of industrial effluents can be\ndone in three phases\n\n(a) Primary treatment by mechanical means.\nThis involves screening, grinding,\nflocculation and sedimentation.\n\n(b) Secondary treatment by biological process\n\n(c) Tertiary treatment by biological,\nchemical and physical processes. This\ninvolves recycling of wastewater.\n\nOverdrawing of ground water reserves by\n\nindustry where there is a threat to ground\nwater resources also needs to be regulated\nlegally. Particulate matter in the air can be\nreduced by fitting smoke stacks to factories\nwith electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters,\nscrubbers and inertial separators. Smoke\ncan be reduced by using oil or gas instead\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\n68°E 12°\n\nAFGHANISTAN\n36°N\n\nPAKISTAN\n39°\n\n/S 4 ial\n: hali i\nJj Mo alii\n\nNiger oe\nBes rises Se\n\n‘29 Noida ~\n\nJaipur %& So w..\n\nARABIAN\nSEA\n\n(Ce 5\n\n16° ge ; Hyderabad\n\nsor\n\n° Ore\né\n\n“. -\n\nbad e\n\nLAKSHADWEEP\n\nINDIAN\n72°E\n\nim _¢ .\nut seee\n\n36°N\nINDIA\n\nSOME SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY PARKS\n\nCHINA\nCTIBET )\n\nati >\n\n€\n\nr-\n\nBAY OF\nBENGAL\n\nVishakhapatnam\n\nANDAMAN & NICOBAR ISLANDS\n(INDIA)\n°\n600 km es Q\n*» 8°N\n°\n\n92°F\n\nIndia: Some Software Technology Parks\n\nMANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nof coal in factories.

    "cleaned_text": "1O68CHO6 MANUFACTURING INVUSTKIES On the occassion of Diwali, Harish went to a market with his parents. They purchased shoes and clothes for him. His mother ~ purchased utensils, sugar, tea and diyas (earthen lamps). Harish observed that the shops in the market were flooded with items for sale. He wondered how so many items could be made in such large quantities. His father explained that shoes, clothes, sugar etc. are manufactured by machines in large industries, some utensils are manufactured in small industries, while items like diyas are made by individual artisans in household industry. Do you have some ideas about these industries? Production of goods in large quantities after processing from raw materials to more valuable products is called manufacturing. Do you know that paper is manufactured from wood, sugar from sugarcane, iron and steel from iron ore and aluminium from bauxite? Do you also know that some types of clothes are manufactured from yarn which itself is an industrial product? People employed in the secondary activities manufacture the primary materials into finished goods. The workers employed in steel factories, car, breweries, textile industries, bakeries etc. fall into this category. Some people are employed in providing services. In this chapter, we are mainly concerned with manufacturing industries which fall in the secondary sector. The economic strength of a country is measured by the development of manufacturing industries. IMPORTANCE OF MANUFACTURING Manufacturing sector is considered the backbone of development in general and economic development in particular mainly because- e Manufacturing industries not only help in modernising agriculture, which forms the backbone of our economy, they also reduce the heavy dependence of people on agricultural income by providing them jobs in secondary and tertiary sectors. ¢ Industrial development is a precondition for eradication of unemployment and poverty from our country. This was the main philosophy behind public sector industries and joint sector ventures in India. It was also aimed at bringing down regional disparities by establishing industries in tribal and backward areas. e Export of manufactured goods expands trade and commerce, and brings in much needed foreign exchange. ¢ Countries that transform their raw materials into a wide variety of finished goods of higher value are prosperous. India’s prosperity lies in increasing and diversifying its manufacturing industries as quickly as possible. Agriculture and industry are not exclusive of each other. They move hand in hand. For instance, the agro-industries in India have given a major boost to agriculture by raising its productivity. They depend on the latter for raw materials and sell their products such as irrigation pumps, fertilisers, insecticides, pesticides, plastic and PVC pipes, machines and tools, etc. to the farmers. Thus, development and competitiveness of Reprint 2O25-26 manufacturing industry has not only assisted agriculturists in increasing their production but also made the production processes very efficient. In the present day world of globalisation, our industry needs to be more efficient and competitive. Self-sufficiency alone is not enough. Our manufactured goods must be at par in quality with those in the international market. Only then, will we be able to compete in the international market. Classification of Industries List the various manufactured products you use in your daily life such as — transistors, electric bulbs, vegetable oil, cement, glassware, petrol, matches, scooters, automobiles, medicines and so on. If we classify the various industries based on a particular criterion then we would be able to understand their manufacturing better. Industries may be classified as follows: On the basis of source of raw materials used: ¢ Agro based: cotton, woollen, jute, silk textile, rubber and sugar, tea, coffee, edible oil. e Mineral based: iron and steel, cement, aluminium, machine tools, petrochemicals. According to their main role: ¢ Basic or key industries are those which supply their products as raw materials to manufacture other goods e.g. iron and steel and copper smelting, aluminum smelting. ¢ Consumer industries that produce goods for direct use by consumers — sugar, toothpaste, paper, sewing machines, allowed on the assets of a unit. This limit has changed over a period of time. At present the maximum investment allowed is rupees one crore. On the basis of ownership: ¢ Public sector, owned and operated by government agencies — BHEL, SAIL etc. ¢ Private sector industries owned and operated by individuals or a group of individuals -TISCO, Bajaj Auto Ltd., Dabur Industries. Joint sector industries which are jointly run by the state and individuals or a group of individuals. Oil India Ltd. (OIL) is jointly owned by public and private sector. * Cooperative sector industries are owned and operated by the producers or suppliers of raw materials, workers or both. They pool in the resources and share the profits or losses proportionately. Such examples are the sugar industry in Maharashtra, the coir industry in Kerala. Based on the bulk and weight of raw material and finished goods: ¢ Heavy industries such as iron and steel e ° Light industries that use light raw materials and produce light goods such as electrical goods industries. Activity Classify the following into two groups on the basis of bulk and weight of raw material and finished goods. (i) Oil (vi) Sewing Machines (ii) Knitting needles (vii) Shipbuilding (iii) Brassware (viii) Electric Bulbs (iv) Fuse wires (ix) Paint brushes (v) Watches (x) Automobiles fans etc. Agro-based Industries On the basis of capital investment: Cotton, jute, silk, woollen textiles, sugar and ¢ A small scale industry is defined with edible oil, etc. industries are based on reference to the maximum investment agricultural raw materials. MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES 59 Reprint 2O25-26 Fibre Spinnin Production P ™ Weaving Knitting Dyeing and —> Garment Finishing <— manufacture Raw fibre i Yarn - Fabric ; Garments i Fig. 6.1: Textile Industry: The textile industry occupies unique position in the Indian economy, because it contributes significantly to industrial production, employment generation and foreign exchange earnings. It is the only industry in the country, which is self-reliant and complete in the value chain i.e., from raw material to the highest value added products. Cotton Textiles: In ancient India, cotton textiles were produced with hand spinning and handloom weaving techniques. After the 18\" century, power-looms came into use. Our traditional industries suffered a setback during the colonial period because they could not compete with the mill-made cloth from England. * The first successful textile mill was ( established in Mumbai in 1854. ¢ The two world wars were fought in Europe, India was a British colony. There was a e demand for cloth in U.K. hence, they gave a boost to the development of the cotton textile industry. In the early years, the cotton textile industry was concentrated in the cotton growing belt of Maharashtra and Gujarat. Availability of raw cotton, market, transport including accessible port facilities, labour, moist climate, etc. contributed towards its localisation. This industry has close links with agriculture and provides a living to farmers, cotton boll pluckers and workers engaged in ginning, spinning, weaving, ) Value addition in the textile industry dyeing, designing, packaging, tailoring and sewing. The industry by creating demands supports many other industries, such as, chemicals and dyes, packaging materials and engineering works. While spinning continues to be centralised in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, weaving is highly decentralised to provide scope for incorporating traditional skills and designs of weaving in cotton, silk, zari, embroidery, etc. India has world class production in spinning, but weaving supplies low quality of fabric as it cannot use much of the high quality yarn produced in the country. Weaving is done by handloom, powerloom and in mills. The handspun khadi provides large scale employment to weavers in their homes as a cottage industry. Why did Mahatma Gandhi lay emphasis on spinning yarn and weaving khadi? Why is it important for our country to keep the mill sector loomage lower than power loom and handloom? Jute Textiles India is the largest producer of raw jute and jute goods and stands at second place as an exporter after Bangladesh. Most of the mills are located in West Bengal, mainly along the banks of the Hugli river, in a narrow belt. The first jute mill was set up near Kolkata in 1855 at Rishra. After Partition in 1947, the ‘ jute mills remained in India but three-fourth ~ of the jute producing area went to Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan).

Kolkata as a large urban centre provides banking, insurance and port facilities for export of jute goods. Sugar Industry India stands second as a world producer of sugar but occupies the first place in the production of gur and khandsari. The raw material used in this industry is bulky, and in haulage its sucrose content reduces. The mills are located in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. Sixty per cent mills are in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. This industry is seasonal in nature so, it is ideally suited to the cooperative sector. Can you explain why this is so? In recent years, there is a tendency for the mills to shift and concentrate in the southern and western states, especially in Maharashtra, This is because the cane produced here has a higher sucrose content. The cooler climate also ensures a longer crushing season. Moreover, the cooperatives are more successful in these Mineral-based Industries Industries that use minerals and metals as raw materials are called mineral-based industries. Can you name some industries that would fall in this category? Iron and Steel Industry The iron and steel industry is the basic industry since all the other industries — heavy, medium and light, depend on it for their machinery. Steel is needed to manufacture a variety of engineering goods, construction material, defence, medical, telephonic, scientific equipment and a variety of consumer goods. Activity Make a list of all such goods made of steel that you can think of. Production and consumption of steel is often regarded as the index of a country’s development. Iron and steel is a heavy industry because all the raw materials as well as finished goods are heavy and bulky entailing heavy transportation costs. Iron ore, coking coal and lime stone are required in the ratio of approximately 4 : 2: 1. Some quantities of manganese, are also required to harden the steel. Where should the steel plants be ideally located? Remember that the finished products also need an efficient transport network for their distribution to the markets and consumers. Processes of Manufacture of Steel Blast Furnace states. Transport of raw material to plant Iron ore is melted. Lime stone is fluxing material which is Pig Iron Molten materials poured into moulds called pigs added, Slag is removed. Coke is burnt to heat the ore.

These include, low cost of iron ore, high grade raw materials in proximity, cheap labour and vast growth potential in the home market. Aluminium Smelting Aluminium smelting is the second most important metallurgical industry in India. It is light, resistant to corrosion, a good conductor of heat, malleable and becomes strong when it is mixed with other metals. It is used to manufacture aircraft, utensils and wires. It has gained popularity as a substitute of steel, copper, zinc and lead in a number of industries. Fig. 6.3: Strip coasting mill at smelter of NALCO Aluminium smelting plants in the country are located in Odisha, West Bengal, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Bauxite, the raw material used in the smelters is a very bulky, dark reddish coloured rock. The flow chart given below shows the process of manufacturing aluminium. Regular supply of electricity and an assured source of raw material at minimum cost are the two prime factors for location of the industry. Chemical Industries The Chemical industry in India is fast growing and diversifying. It comprises both large and small scale manufacturing units. Rapid growth has been recorded in both inorganic and organic sectors. Inorganic chemicals include sulphuric acid (used to manufacture fertilizers, synthetic fibres, plastics, adhesives, paints, dyes stuffs), nitric acid, alkalies, soda ash (used to make glass, soaps and detergents, paper) and caustic soda. These industries are widely spread over the country. Why do you think it is so?

Make a list of the products you are aware of. Fertilizer Industry The fertilizer industry is centred around the production of nitrogenous fertilizers (mainly urea), phosphatic fertilizers and ammonium phosphate (DAP) and complex fertilizers which have a combination of nitrogen (N), phosphate (P), and potash (K). The third, i.e. potash is entirely imported as the country does not have any reserves of commercially usable potash or potassium compounds in any form. After the Green Revolution the industry expanded to several other parts of the country. Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Kerala contribute towards half of the fertilizer production. Other significant producers are Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Bihar, Maharashtra, Assam, West Bengal, Goa, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. Cement Industry Cement is essential for construction activity such as building houses, factories, bridges, roads, airports, dams and for other commercial establishments. This industry requires bulky and heavy raw materials like limestone, silica and gypsum. Coal and electric power are needed apart from rail transportation. Activity Where would it be economically viable to set up the cement manufacturing units? The industry has strategically located plants in Gujarat that have suitable access to the market in the Gulf countries. Activity Find out where the plants are located in other States of India. Find their names. The first cement plant was set-up in Chennai in 19O4. After Independence the industry expanded. Automobile Industry Automobiles provide vehicle for quick transport of good services and passengers. Trucks, buses, cars, motor cycles, scooters, three-wheelers and multi-utility vehicles are manufactured in India at various centres. After the liberalisation, the coming in of new and contemporary models stimulated the demand for vehicles in the market, which led to the healthy growth of the industry including passenger cars, two and three-wheelers. The industry is located around Delhi, Gurugram, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Kolkata, Lucknow, Indore, Hyderabad, Jamshedpur and Bengaluru. Information Technology and Electronics Industry The electronics industry covers a wide range of products from transistor sets to television, telephones, cellular telecom, telephone exchange, radars, computers and many other equipments required by the telecommunication industry. Bengaluru has emerged as the electronic capital of India. Other important centres for electronic goods are Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Pune, Chennai, Kolkata, Lucknow and Coimbatore.

The main culprits in this regard are paper, pulp, chemical, textile and dyeing, petroleum refineries, tanneries and electroplating industries that let out dyes, detergents, acids, salts and heavy metals like lead and mercury pesticides, fertilisers, synthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and rubber, etc. into the water bodies. Fly ash, phospo- gypsum and iron and steel slags are the major solid wastes in India. Thermal pollution of water occurs when hot water from factories and thermal plants is drained into rivers and ponds before cooling. What would be the effect on aquatic life? Wastes from nuclear power plants, nuclear and weapon production facilities cause cancers, birth defects and miscarriages. Soil and water pollution are closely related. Dumping of wastes specially glass, harmful chemicals, industrial effluents, packaging, salts and garbage renders the soil useless. Rain water percolates to the soil carrying the pollutants to the ground and the ground water also gets contaminated. Noise pollution not only results in irritation and anger, it can also cause hearing impairment, increased heart rate and blood pressure among other physiological effects. Unwanted sound is an irritant and a source of stress. Industrial and construction activities, machinery, factory equipment, generators, saws and pneumatic and electric drills also make a lot of noise. Control of Environmental Degradation Every litre of waste water discharged by our industry pollutes eight times the quantity of freshwater. How can the industrial pollution of fresh water be reduced? Some suggestions are- (i) minimising use water for processing by reusing and recycling it in two or more successive stages (ii) harvesting of rainwater to meet water requirements (iii) treating hot water and effluents before releasing them in rivers and ponds. Treatment of industrial effluents can be done in three phases (a) Primary treatment by mechanical means. This involves screening, grinding, flocculation and sedimentation. (b) Secondary treatment by biological process (c) Tertiary treatment by biological, chemical and physical processes. This involves recycling of wastewater. Overdrawing of ground water reserves by industry where there is a threat to ground water resources also needs to be regulated legally. Particulate matter in the air can be reduced by fitting smoke stacks to factories with electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters, scrubbers and inertial separators.

His mother ~\npurchased utensils, sugar, tea and diyas\n(earthen lamps). Harish observed that the\nshops in the market were flooded with\nitems for sale. He wondered how so many\nitems could be made in such large\nquantities. His father explained that shoes,\nclothes, sugar etc. are manufactured by\nmachines in large industries, some utensils\nare manufactured in small industries, while\nitems like diyas are made by individual\nartisans in household industry.\n\nDo you have some ideas about these\nindustries?\n\nProduction of goods in large quantities after\nprocessing from raw materials to more\nvaluable products is called manufacturing. Do\nyou know that paper is manufactured from\nwood, sugar from sugarcane, iron and steel\nfrom iron ore and aluminium from bauxite?\nDo you also know that some types of clothes\nare manufactured from yarn which itself is an\nindustrial product?\n\nPeople employed in the secondary activities\nmanufacture the primary materials into\nfinished goods. The workers employed in steel\nfactories, car, breweries, textile industries,\nbakeries etc. fall into this category. Some people\nare employed in providing services. In this\nchapter, we are mainly concerned with\nmanufacturing industries which fall in the\nsecondary sector.\n\nThe economic strength of a country is\nmeasured by the development of\nmanufacturing industries.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF MANUFACTURING\n\nManufacturing sector is considered the backbone\nof development in general and economic\ndevelopment in particular mainly because-\n\ne Manufacturing industries not only help in\nmodernising agriculture, which forms the\nbackbone of our economy, they also reduce\nthe heavy dependence of people on\nagricultural income by providing them jobs\nin secondary and tertiary sectors.\n\n¢ Industrial development is a precondition for\neradication of unemployment and poverty\nfrom our country. This was the main\nphilosophy behind public sector industries\nand joint sector ventures in India. It was also\naimed at bringing down regional disparities\nby establishing industries in tribal and\nbackward areas.\n\ne Export of manufactured goods expands\ntrade and commerce, and brings in much\nneeded foreign exchange.\n\n¢ Countries that transform their raw\nmaterials into a wide variety of finished\ngoods of higher value are prosperous.\nIndia’s prosperity lies in increasing and\ndiversifying its manufacturing industries as\nquickly as possible.\n\nAgriculture and industry are not exclusive\nof each other. They move hand in hand. For\ninstance, the agro-industries in India have\ngiven a major boost to agriculture by raising\nits productivity. They depend on the latter for\nraw materials and sell their products such as\nirrigation pumps, fertilisers, insecticides,\npesticides, plastic and PVC pipes, machines\nand tools, etc. to the farmers.

It\nis the only industry in the country, which is\nself-reliant and complete in the value chain\ni.e., from raw material to the highest value\nadded products.\n\nCotton Textiles: In ancient India, cotton\ntextiles were produced with hand spinning\nand handloom weaving techniques. After\nthe 18\" century, power-looms came into\nuse. Our traditional industries suffered a\nsetback during the colonial period because\nthey could not compete with the mill-made\ncloth from England.\n\n* The first successful textile mill was (\n\nestablished in Mumbai in 1854.\n\n¢ The two world wars were fought in Europe,\n\nIndia was a British colony. There was a\n\ne demand for cloth in U.K. hence, they gave\n\na boost to the development of the cotton\ntextile industry.\n\nIn the early years, the cotton textile\nindustry was concentrated in the cotton\ngrowing belt of Maharashtra and Gujarat.\nAvailability of raw cotton, market, transport\nincluding accessible port facilities, labour,\nmoist climate, etc. contributed towards its\nlocalisation. This industry has close links\nwith agriculture and provides a living to\nfarmers, cotton boll pluckers and workers\nengaged in ginning, spinning, weaving,\n\n)\n\nValue addition in the textile industry\n\ndyeing, designing, packaging, tailoring and\nsewing. The industry by creating demands\nsupports many other industries, such as,\nchemicals and dyes, packaging materials\nand engineering works.\n\nWhile spinning continues to be centralised\nin Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu,\nweaving is highly decentralised to provide\nscope for incorporating traditional skills and\ndesigns of weaving in cotton, silk, zari,\nembroidery, etc. India has world class\nproduction in spinning, but weaving supplies\nlow quality of fabric as it cannot use much of\nthe high quality yarn produced in the country.\nWeaving is done by handloom, powerloom and\nin mills.\n\nThe handspun khadi provides large scale\nemployment to weavers in their homes as a\ncottage industry.\n\nWhy did Mahatma Gandhi lay emphasis on\nspinning yarn and weaving khadi?\n\nWhy is it important for our country to\nkeep the mill sector loomage lower than\npower loom and handloom?\n\nJute Textiles\n\nIndia is the largest producer of raw jute and\njute goods and stands at second place as an\nexporter after Bangladesh. Most of the mills are\nlocated in West Bengal, mainly along the banks\nof the Hugli river, in a narrow belt.\n\nThe first jute mill was set up near Kolkata in\n1855 at Rishra. After Partition in 1947, the ‘\njute mills remained in India but three-fourth ~\nof the jute producing area went to\nBangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan).\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

Kolkata as a large urban\ncentre provides banking, insurance and port\nfacilities for export of jute goods.\n\nSugar Industry\n\nIndia stands second as a world producer of\nsugar but occupies the first place in the\nproduction of gur and khandsari. The raw\nmaterial used in this industry is bulky, and in\nhaulage its sucrose content reduces.

Sixty per cent mills are in\nUttar Pradesh and Bihar. This industry is\nseasonal in nature so, it is ideally suited to the\ncooperative sector. Can you explain why this\nis so?\n\nIn recent years, there is a tendency for the\nmills to shift and concentrate in the southern\nand western states, especially in Maharashtra,\nThis is because the cane produced here has a\nhigher sucrose content. The cooler climate also\nensures a longer crushing season.

Iron and steel is a heavy industry\nbecause all the raw materials as well as\nfinished goods are heavy and bulky entailing\nheavy transportation costs. Iron ore, coking\ncoal and lime stone are required in the ratio of\napproximately 4 : 2: 1. Some quantities of\nmanganese, are also required to harden the\nsteel.

Smoke is emitted by chemical and\npaper factories, brick kilns, refineries and\nsmelting plants, and burning of fossil fuels in\nbig and small factories that ignore pollution\nnorms. Toxic gas leaks can be very hazardous\nwith long-term effects. Are you aware of the\nBhopal Gas tragedy that occurred? Air\npollution adversely affects human health,\nanimals, plants, buildings and the atmosphere\nas a whole.\n\nWater pollution is caused by organic and\ninorganic industrial wastes and affluents\ndischarged into rivers. The main culprits in this\nregard are paper, pulp, chemical, textile and\ndyeing, petroleum refineries, tanneries and\nelectroplating industries that let out dyes,\ndetergents, acids, salts and heavy metals like\nlead and mercury pesticides, fertilisers,\nsynthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and\nrubber, etc. into the water bodies. Fly ash,\nphospo- gypsum and iron and steel slags are\nthe major solid wastes in India.\n\nThermal pollution of water occurs when hot\nwater from factories and thermal plants is\ndrained into rivers and ponds before cooling.\nWhat would be the effect on aquatic life?\nWastes from nuclear power plants, nuclear\nand weapon production facilities cause\ncancers, birth defects and miscarriages. Soil\nand water pollution are closely related.\n\nDumping of wastes specially glass, harmful\nchemicals, industrial effluents, packaging, salts\nand garbage renders the soil useless. Rain\nwater percolates to the soil carrying the\npollutants to the ground and the ground water\nalso gets contaminated.\n\nNoise pollution not only results in irritation\nand anger, it can also cause hearing\nimpairment, increased heart rate and blood\npressure among other physiological effects.\nUnwanted sound is an irritant and a source of\nstress. Industrial and construction activities,\nmachinery, factory equipment, generators,\nsaws and pneumatic and electric drills also\nmake a lot of noise.\n\nControl of Environmental Degradation\n\nEvery litre of waste water discharged by our\nindustry pollutes eight times the quantity of\nfreshwater. How can the industrial pollution of\nfresh water be reduced? Some suggestions are-\n(i) minimising use water for processing by\nreusing and recycling it in two or more\nsuccessive stages\n\n(ii) harvesting of rainwater to meet water\nrequirements\n\n(iii) treating hot water and effluents before\nreleasing them in rivers and ponds.\nTreatment of industrial effluents can be\ndone in three phases\n\n(a) Primary treatment by mechanical means.\nThis involves screening, grinding,\nflocculation and sedimentation.\n\n(b) Secondary treatment by biological process\n\n(c) Tertiary treatment by biological,\nchemical and physical processes. This\ninvolves recycling of wastewater.\n\nOverdrawing of ground water reserves by\n\nindustry where there is a threat to ground\nwater resources also needs to be regulated\nlegally. Particulate matter in the air can be\nreduced by fitting smoke stacks to factories\nwith electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters,\nscrubbers and inertial separators. Smoke\ncan be reduced by using oil or gas instead\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

Some of these are available in our\nimmediate surroundings, while other\nrequirements are met by bringing things from\nother places. Goods and services do not move\nfrom supply locales to demand locales on their\nown. The movement of these goods and services\nfrom their supply locations to demand locations\nnecessitates the need for transport. Some people\nare engaged in facilitating these movements.\nThese are known to be traders who make the\nproducts come to the consumers by\ntransportation. Thus, the pace of development\nof a country depends upon the production of\ngoods and services as well as their movement\nover space. Therefore, efficient means of transport\nare prerequisites for fast development.\nMovement of these goods and services can be\nover three important domains of our earth i.e. land,\nwater and air. Based on these, transport can also\nbe classified into land, water and air transport.\n\nthe help of equally developed communication\nsystem. Therefore, transport, communication\nand trade are complementary to each other.\n\nToday, India is well-linked with the rest of\nthe world despite its vast size, diversity and\nlinguistic and socio-cultural plurality.\nRailways, airways, waterways, newspapers,\nradio, television, cinema and internet, etc. have\nbeen contributing to its socio-economic\nprogress in many ways. The trades from local\nto international levels have added to the vitality\nof its economy. It has enriched our life and\nadded substantially to growing amenities and\nfacilities for the comforts of life.\n\nIn this chapter, you will see how modern\nmeans of transport and communication serve\nas lifelines of our nation and its modern\neconomy. It is thus, evident that a dense and\nefficient network of transport and\ncommunication is a prerequisite for local,\nnational and global trade of today.\n\nMeans of Transport\n\nSS —,,\n\nLand Water Air |\nRoadways Railways Pipelines Inland Overseas nae ee a\nPublic Undertaking\nPrivate Airlines\nFig. 7.1\nFor a long time, trade and transport were ‘TRANSPORT\nrestricted to a limited space. With the\n\nRoadways\n\ndevelopment in science and technology, the\narea of influence of trade and transport\nexpanded far and wide. Today, the world has\nbeen converted into a large village with the help\nof efficient and fast moving transport.\nTransport has been able to achieve this with\n\nIndia has second largest road networks in the\nworld, aggregating to about 62.16 lakh km\n(2020-21). In India, roadways have preceded\nrailways. They still have an edge over railways\nin view of the ease with which they can be built\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nand maintained. The growing importance of\nroad transport vis-a-vis rail transport is\nrooted in the following reasons; (a)\nconstruction cost of roads is much lower\nthan that of railway lines, (b) roads can\ntraverse comparatively more dissected and\nundulating topography, (c) roads can\nnegotiate higher gradients of slopes and as\nsuch can traverse mountains such as the\nHimalayas, (d) road transport is economical\nin transportation of few persons and\nrelatively smaller amount of goods over\nshort distances, (e) it also provides door-\nto-door service, thus the cost of loading\nand unloading is much lower, (f) road\ntransport is also used as a feeder to other\nmodes of transport such as they provide a\nlink between railway stations, air and\nsea ports.\n\nIn India, roads are classified in the\nfollowing six classes according to their\ncapacity. Look at the map of the National\nHighways and find out about the significant\nrole played by these roads.\n\n¢ Golden Quadrilateral Super Highways:\nThe government has launched a major\nroad development project linking Delhi-\nKolkata-Chennai-Mumbai and Delhi by\nsix-lane Super Highways. The North-\nSouth corridors linking Srinagar (Jammu\n& Kashmir) and Kanniyakumari (Tamil\nNadu), and East-West Corridor\nconnecting Silchar (Assam) and Porbander\n(Gujarat) are part of this project. The\nmajor objective of these Super Highways\nis to reduce the time and distance\nbetween the mega cities of India. These\nhighway projects are being implemented\nby the National Highway Authority of\nIndia (NHAI).\n\ne National Highways: National Highways\nlink extreme parts of the country. These\nare the primary road systems. A number\nof major National Highways run in North-\nSouth and East-West directions.\n\ne State Highways: Roads linking a state\ncapital with different district headquarters\nare known as State Highways.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig.7.2: Ahmedabad- Vadodara Expressway\n\nActivity ff.\n\nCollect information of National Highway\nnumbers (old and new) from the website\nmorth.nic.in/national-highway-details. The\nhistorical Sher-Shah Suri Marg between\nDelhi and Amritsar is known by which\nNational Highway ?\n\nDistrict Roads: These roads connect the\ndistrict headquarters with other places of\nthe district.\n\nOther Roads: Rural roads, which link rural\nareas and villages with towns, are classified\nunder this category. These roads received\nspecial impetus under the Pradhan Mantri\nGrameen Sadak Yojana. Under this scheme\nspecial provisions are made so that every\nvillage in the country is linked to a major\ntown in the country by an all season\nmotorable road.\n\nBorder Roads: Apart from these, Border\nRoads Organisation a Government of India\nundertaking constructs and maintains\nroads in the bordering areas of the\ncountry. This organisation was established\nin 1960 for the development of the roads\nof strategic importance in the northern and\nnorth-eastern border areas. These roads\nhave improved accessibility in areas of\ndifficult terrain and have helped in the\neconomic development of these area.\n\n\n\n68°E 12° 76° 80°\n\nAFGHANISTAN\n\n36°N\n\nKyplang\nPathanko} Kul lla\n\nAtari EN\nZ CG El alandhar SY & t\nWozpUuly'e TEN capncigar a8\n\nSri Ganganagays Jigs ioe\nAmbala\n\nDeltadtin °\nAa saloon 2\nGurugram WDELHI >\nikaner :\nPy ia eal Bey (Faridabad, , \\.\npele Shahjahanpur\nVa (23) Jodhpur\nGa.\n|\n\n28°\n°\nBarmer Beawarfl\n\n{45}. e Jabalpur\n\nIndore a fol . 4\n\nVadodara «Betul\n\nJalgaon\n\na. ° EB} *\n\nNagpur\n\nJagdalpur’,\n\na w*\n\n[44]\nHyderabad\n\nLAKSHADWEEP\n(INDIA)\n\n° — Thiruvanthapuram\n\nIndia: National Highways\n\nAyodh\nae =\n\n84° 88° 92° 96°E\n\nINDIA\nNATIONAL HIGHWAYS\n\n(64\n\ni\nae NV\nZ\n\n4 “eS\nre ae\n4.0 ae es ofl 3) Te zu af\n\n| vanegef Bp “™\nBHUTAN Jorhat 7\n\n\"wow ny\n\n“ 2 ca\n\nea Purnia\n\nye\nl\n\nBaharagora\n\nRaipur Bg a\n‘Bi\n\naa Koraput\nSera (ial\nizianagaram\n\nBENGAL\n\nNorth-South corridor\n\nEast-West corridor\n\nGolden Quadrilateral\n\nNational Highway with Number\n\nLIFELINES OF NATIONAL ECONOMY\n\n\n\nDo you Know?\n\nThe World’s longest Highway tunnel-Atal\nTunnel (9.02 Km) has been built by Border\nRoad Organisation.

Earlier the valley was cut off for about\n6 months each year owing to heavy snowfall.\nThe tunnel is buit with ultra-modern\nspecifications in the Pir Panjal range of\nHimalayas at an altitude of 3000 metres\nfrom the Mean Sea Level (MSL).\n\nSource: http: //www.bro.gov.in/pagefimg.\nasp?imid=144,And PIBdelhi030ctober2020\n\nFig. 7.3: Hilly Tracts\n\nFig. 7.4: Traffic on north-eastern border road\n(Arunachal Pradesh)\n\nRoads can also be classified on the basis of\nthe type of material used for their construction\nsuch as metalled and unmetalled roads.\nMetalled roads may be made of cement,\n\nconcrete or even bitumen of coal, therefore,\n\nthese are all weather roads. Unmetalled roads\n\ngo out of use in the rainy season.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nRailways\n\nRailways are the principal mode of\ntransportation for freight and passengers\nin India. Railways also make it possible for\npeople to conduct multifarious activities\nlike business, sightseeing, pilgrimage\nalong with transportation of goods over\nlonger distances. Apart from an important\nmeans of transport the Indian Railways\nhave been a great integrating force for more\nthan 150 years. Railways in India bind the\neconomic life of the country as well as\naccelerate the development of the industry\nand agriculture.\n\n8\nThe Indian Railways is the largest public\n\ne sector undertaking in the country. The first\ntrain steamed off from Mumbai to Thane in\n1853, covering a distance of 34 km.\n\nThe Indian Railway is now reorganised into\n17 zones.\n\n- Activity ————+\nFind out the current Railway zones and their\nheadquarters. Also locate the headquarters\nof Railway zones on the map of India.\n\nThe distribution pattern of the Railway\nnetwork in the country has been largely\ninfluenced by physiographic, economic and\nadministrative factors. The northern plains with\ntheir vast level land, high population density\nand rich agricultural resources provided the most\nfavourable condition for their growth. However,\na large number of rivers requiring construction\nof bridges across their wide beds posed some\nobstacles. In the hilly terrains of the peninsular\nregion, railway tracts are laid through low hills,\ngaps or tunnels. The Himalayan mountainous\nregions too are unfavourable for the construction\nof railway lines due to high relief, sparse\npopulation and lack of economic opportunities.\nLikewise, it was difficult to lay railway lines on\nthe sandy plain of western Rajasthan, swamps\nof Gujarat, forested tracks of Madhya Pradesh,\nChhattisgarh, Odisha and Jharkhand. The\ncontiguous stretch of Sahyadri could be crossed\n\n\n\nTable 7.1: India: Railway Track\nThe Indian Railway network runs on multiple gauge operations extending over 67,956 km.\n\nGauge in metres\n\nBroad Gauge (1.676)\n\nMetre Gauge (1.000)\nNarrow Gauge (0.762 and 0.610)\n\nRoute (Km)\n\nSource: Railway Yearbook 2019-20, Ministry of Railways, Government of India.\n\nWebsite: www.indianrailways.gov.in\n\nonly through gaps or passes (Ghats). In recent\ntimes, the development of the Konkan railway\nalong the west coast has facilitated the movement\nof passengers and goods in this most important\neconomic region of India. It has also faced a\nnumber of problem such as sinking of track in\nsome stretches and landslides.\n\nToday, the railways have become more\nimportant in our national economy than all\nother means of transport put together. However,\nrail transport suffers from certain problems as\nwell. Many passengers travel without tickets.\nThefts and damaging of railway property has\nnot yet stopped completely. People stop the\ntrains, pull the chain unnecessarily and this\ncauses heavy damage to the railway. Think over\nit, how we can help our railway in running as\nper the scheduled time?\n\nPipelines\n\nPipeline transport network is a new arrival on\nthe transportation map of India. In the past,\nthese were used to transport water to cities and\nindustries. Now, these are used for transporting\ncrude oil, petroleum products and natural gas\nfrom oil and natural gas fields to refineries,\nfertilizer factories and big thermal power plants.\nSolids can also be transported through a\npipeline when converted into slurry. The far\ninland locations of refineries like Barauni,\nMathura, Panipat and gas based fertilizer plants\ncould be thought of only because of pipelines.\nInitial cost of laying pipelines is high but\nsubsequent running costs are minimal. It rules\nout trans-shipment losses or delays.\n\nThere are three important networks of\npipeline transportation in the country.\n\ne From oil field in upper Assam to Kanpur\n(Uttar Pradesh), via Guwahati, Barauni and\nPrayagraj. It has branches from Barauni to\nHaldia, via Rajbandh, Rajbandh to\nMaurigram and Guwahati to Siliguri.\n\ne From Salaya in Gujarat to Jalandhar in\nPunjab, via Viramgam, Mathura, Delhi and\nSonipat. It has branches to connect Koyali\n(near Vadodara, Gujarat) Chakshu and\nother places.\n\ne The first 1,700 km long Hazira-Vijaipur-\nJagdishpur (HVJ) cross country gas\npipeline, linked Mumbai High and Bassein\ngas fields with various ferilizer, power and\nindustrial complexes in western and\nnorthern India. Overall, India’s gas pipeline\ninfrastructure has expanded from 1,700 km\nto 18,500 km of cross-country pipelines.\n\nWaterways\n\nSince the ancient period, India was one of the\nseafaring countries. Its seamen sailed far and\nnear, thus, carrying and spreading Indian\ncommerce and culture. Waterways are the\ncheapest means of transport. They are most\nsuitable for carrying heavy and bulky goods. It\nis a fuel-efficient and environment friendly mode\nof transport. India has inland navigation\nwaterways of 14,500 km in length. In order to\ncreate wide waterways network and to promote\ninland water transport in the country as an\neconomical environment friendly\nsupplementary mode of transport to rail and\nroad, 111 inland waterways (including 5\nNational Waterways declared earlier) were\ndeclared as National Waterways (NWs) by the\nNational Waterways Act, 2016.

These are Mandavi, Zuari and\nCumberjua, Sunderbans, Barak and\nbackwaters of Kerala.\n\nApart from these, India’s trade with foreign\ncountries is carried from the ports located along\nthe coast. 95 per cent of the country’s trade\nvolume (68 per cent in terms of value) is moved\nby sea.\n\nMajor Sea Ports\n\nWith a long coastline of 7,516.6 km, India is\ndotted with 12 major and 200 notified non-\nmajors (minor/intermediate) ports. These\nmajor ports handle 95 per cent of India’s\nforeign trade.\n\nDeendayal Port (Kandla) in Kuchchh was\nthe first port developed soon after\nIndependence to ease the volume of trade on\nthe Mumbai port, in the wake of loss of\nKarachi port to Pakistan after the Partition.\n\nDeendayal Port, is a tidal port. It caters to\nthe convenient handling of exports and imports\nof highly productive granary and industrial\nbelt stretching across UT of Jammu and\nKashmir, and the states of Himachal Pradesh,\nPunjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat.\n\nFig. 7.6: Trucks being driven into the vessel at\nMumbai port\n\nMumbai is the biggest port with a\nspacious natural and well-sheltered harbour.\nThe Jawaharlal Nehru port was planned with\na view to decongest the Mumbai port and\nserve as a hub port for this region.

    "cleaned_text": "1O68CHO7 LIFELINES OF NATIONAL ECONOMY We use different materials and services in our daily life. Some of these are available in our immediate surroundings, while other requirements are met by bringing things from other places. Goods and services do not move from supply locales to demand locales on their own. The movement of these goods and services from their supply locations to demand locations necessitates the need for transport. Some people are engaged in facilitating these movements. These are known to be traders who make the products come to the consumers by transportation. Thus, the pace of development of a country depends upon the production of goods and services as well as their movement over space. Therefore, efficient means of transport are prerequisites for fast development. Movement of these goods and services can be over three important domains of our earth i.e. land, water and air. Based on these, transport can also be classified into land, water and air transport. the help of equally developed communication system. Therefore, transport, communication and trade are complementary to each other. Today, India is well-linked with the rest of the world despite its vast size, diversity and linguistic and socio-cultural plurality. Railways, airways, waterways, newspapers, radio, television, cinema and internet, etc. have been contributing to its socio-economic progress in many ways. The trades from local to international levels have added to the vitality of its economy. It has enriched our life and added substantially to growing amenities and facilities for the comforts of life. In this chapter, you will see how modern means of transport and communication serve as lifelines of our nation and its modern economy. It is thus, evident that a dense and efficient network of transport and communication is a prerequisite for local, national and global trade of today. Means of Transport SS —,, Land Water Air I Roadways Railways Pipelines Inland Overseas nae ee a Public Undertaking Private Airlines Fig. 7.1 For a long time, trade and transport were ‘TRANSPORT restricted to a limited space. With the Roadways development in science and technology, the area of influence of trade and transport expanded far and wide. Today, the world has been converted into a large village with the help of efficient and fast moving transport. Transport has been able to achieve this with India has second largest road networks in the world, aggregating to about 62.16 lakh km (2O2O-21). In India, roadways have preceded railways. They still have an edge over railways in view of the ease with which they can be built Reprint 2O25-26 and maintained. The growing importance of road transport vis-a-vis rail transport is rooted in the following reasons; (a) construction cost of roads is much lower than that of railway lines, (b) roads can traverse comparatively more dissected and undulating topography, (c) roads can negotiate higher gradients of slopes and as such can traverse mountains such as the Himalayas, (d) road transport is economical in transportation of few persons and relatively smaller amount of goods over short distances, (e) it also provides door- to-door service, thus the cost of loading and unloading is much lower, (f) road transport is also used as a feeder to other modes of transport such as they provide a link between railway stations, air and sea ports. In India, roads are classified in the following six classes according to their capacity. Look at the map of the National Highways and find out about the significant role played by these roads. ¢ Golden Quadrilateral Super Highways: The government has launched a major road development project linking Delhi- Kolkata-Chennai-Mumbai and Delhi by six-lane Super Highways. The North- South corridors linking Srinagar (Jammu & Kashmir) and Kanniyakumari (Tamil Nadu), and East-West Corridor connecting Silchar (Assam) and Porbander (Gujarat) are part of this project. The major objective of these Super Highways is to reduce the time and distance between the mega cities of India. These highway projects are being implemented by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). e National Highways: National Highways link extreme parts of the country. These are the primary road systems. A number of major National Highways run in North- South and East-West directions. e State Highways: Roads linking a state capital with different district headquarters are known as State Highways. CONTEMPORARY INDIA — II Fig.7.2: Ahmedabad- Vadodara Expressway Activity ff. Collect information of National Highway numbers (old and new) from the website morth.nic.in/national-highway-details. The historical Sher-Shah Suri Marg between Delhi and Amritsar is known by which National Highway ? District Roads: These roads connect the district headquarters with other places of the district. Other Roads: Rural roads, which link rural areas and villages with towns, are classified under this category. These roads received special impetus under the Pradhan Mantri Grameen Sadak Yojana. Under this scheme special provisions are made so that every village in the country is linked to a major town in the country by an all season motorable road. Border Roads: Apart from these, Border Roads Organisation a Government of India undertaking constructs and maintains roads in the bordering areas of the country. This organisation was established in 196O for the development of the roads of strategic importance in the northern and north-eastern border areas. These roads have improved accessibility in areas of difficult terrain and have helped in the economic development of these area. 68°E 12° 76° 8O° AFGHANISTAN 36°N Kyplang Pathanko} Kul lla Atari EN Z CG El alandhar SY & t WozpUuly'e TEN capncigar a8 Sri Ganganagays Jigs ioe Ambala Deltadtin ° Aa saloon 2 Gurugram WDELHI > ikaner : Py ia eal Bey (Faridabad, , \\. pele Shahjahanpur Va (23) Jodhpur Ga.

Metalled roads may be made of cement, concrete or even bitumen of coal, therefore, these are all weather roads. Unmetalled roads go out of use in the rainy season. CONTEMPORARY INDIA — II Railways Railways are the principal mode of transportation for freight and passengers in India. Railways also make it possible for people to conduct multifarious activities like business, sightseeing, pilgrimage along with transportation of goods over longer distances. Apart from an important means of transport the Indian Railways have been a great integrating force for more than 15O years. Railways in India bind the economic life of the country as well as accelerate the development of the industry and agriculture. 8 The Indian Railways is the largest public e sector undertaking in the country. The first train steamed off from Mumbai to Thane in 1853, covering a distance of 34 km. The Indian Railway is now reorganised into 17 zones. - Activity ————+ Find out the current Railway zones and their headquarters. Also locate the headquarters of Railway zones on the map of India. The distribution pattern of the Railway network in the country has been largely influenced by physiographic, economic and administrative factors. The northern plains with their vast level land, high population density and rich agricultural resources provided the most favourable condition for their growth. However, a large number of rivers requiring construction of bridges across their wide beds posed some obstacles. In the hilly terrains of the peninsular region, railway tracts are laid through low hills, gaps or tunnels. The Himalayan mountainous regions too are unfavourable for the construction of railway lines due to high relief, sparse population and lack of economic opportunities. Likewise, it was difficult to lay railway lines on the sandy plain of western Rajasthan, swamps of Gujarat, forested tracks of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Jharkhand. The contiguous stretch of Sahyadri could be crossed Table 7.1: India: Railway Track The Indian Railway network runs on multiple gauge operations extending over 67,956 km.

Website: www.indianrailways.gov.in only through gaps or passes (Ghats). In recent times, the development of the Konkan railway along the west coast has facilitated the movement of passengers and goods in this most important economic region of India. It has also faced a number of problem such as sinking of track in some stretches and landslides. Today, the railways have become more important in our national economy than all other means of transport put together. However, rail transport suffers from certain problems as well. Many passengers travel without tickets. Thefts and damaging of railway property has not yet stopped completely. People stop the trains, pull the chain unnecessarily and this causes heavy damage to the railway. Think over it, how we can help our railway in running as per the scheduled time? Pipelines Pipeline transport network is a new arrival on the transportation map of India. In the past, these were used to transport water to cities and industries. Now, these are used for transporting crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas from oil and natural gas fields to refineries, fertilizer factories and big thermal power plants. Solids can also be transported through a pipeline when converted into slurry. The far inland locations of refineries like Barauni, Mathura, Panipat and gas based fertilizer plants could be thought of only because of pipelines. Initial cost of laying pipelines is high but subsequent running costs are minimal. It rules out trans-shipment losses or delays. There are three important networks of pipeline transportation in the country. e From oil field in upper Assam to Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh), via Guwahati, Barauni and Prayagraj. It has branches from Barauni to Haldia, via Rajbandh, Rajbandh to Maurigram and Guwahati to Siliguri. e From Salaya in Gujarat to Jalandhar in Punjab, via Viramgam, Mathura, Delhi and Sonipat. It has branches to connect Koyali (near Vadodara, Gujarat) Chakshu and other places. e The first 1,7OO km long Hazira-Vijaipur- Jagdishpur (HVJ) cross country gas pipeline, linked Mumbai High and Bassein gas fields with various ferilizer, power and industrial complexes in western and northern India. Overall, India’s gas pipeline infrastructure has expanded from 1,7OO km to 18,5OO km of cross-country pipelines. Waterways Since the ancient period, India was one of the seafaring countries. Its seamen sailed far and near, thus, carrying and spreading Indian commerce and culture. Waterways are the cheapest means of transport. They are most suitable for carrying heavy and bulky goods. It is a fuel-efficient and environment friendly mode of transport. India has inland navigation waterways of 14,5OO km in length. In order to create wide waterways network and to promote inland water transport in the country as an economical environment friendly supplementary mode of transport to rail and road, 111 inland waterways (including 5 National Waterways declared earlier) were declared as National Waterways (NWs) by the National Waterways Act, 2O16.

Apart from these, India’s trade with foreign countries is carried from the ports located along the coast. 95 per cent of the country’s trade volume (68 per cent in terms of value) is moved by sea. Major Sea Ports With a long coastline of 7,516.6 km, India is dotted with 12 major and 2OO notified non- majors (minor/intermediate) ports. These major ports handle 95 per cent of India’s foreign trade. Deendayal Port (Kandla) in Kuchchh was the first port developed soon after Independence to ease the volume of trade on the Mumbai port, in the wake of loss of Karachi port to Pakistan after the Partition. Deendayal Port, is a tidal port. It caters to the convenient handling of exports and imports of highly productive granary and industrial belt stretching across UT of Jammu and Kashmir, and the states of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat. Fig. 7.6: Trucks being driven into the vessel at Mumbai port Mumbai is the biggest port with a spacious natural and well-sheltered harbour. The Jawaharlal Nehru port was planned with a view to decongest the Mumbai port and serve as a hub port for this region. Mormugao port (Goa) is the premier iron ore exporting port of the country. This port accounts for about fifty per cent of India’s iron ore export. New Mangalore port, located in Karnataka caters to the export of iron ore concentrates from Kudremukh mines. Cochin is the extreme south-western port, located at the entrance of a lagoon with a natural harbour. 7 Se Fig. 7.7: Tanker discharging crude oil at New Mangalore port Moving along the east coast, you would see the extreme south-eastern port of V.O. Chidambaranar (Tuticorin), in Tamil Nadu. This port has a natural harbour and rich hinterland. Thus, it has a flourishing trade handling of a large variety of cargoes to even LIFELINES OF NATIONAL ECONOMY our neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka, Maldives, etc. and the coastal regions of India. Chennai is one of the oldest artificial ports of the country. It is ranked next to Mumbai in terms of the volume of trade and cargo. Vishakhapatnam is the deepest landlocked and well-protected port. This port was, originally, conceived as an outlet for iron ore exports. Paradwip port located in Odisha, specialises in the export of iron ore. Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, Kolkata is an inland riverine port. This port serves a very large and rich hinterland of Ganga- Brahmaputra basin. Being a tidal port, it requires constant dredging of Hoogly. Haldia port was developed as a subsidiary port, in order to relieve growing pressure on the Kolkata port.

Think of the north-eastern part of the country, marked with the presence of big rivers, dissected relief, dense forests and frequent floods and international frontiers, etc. in the absence of air transport. Air travel has made access easier. Pawanhans Helicopters Ltd. provides helicopter services to Oil and Natural Gas Corporation in its off-shore operations, to inaccessible areas and difficult terrains like the north-eastern states and the interior parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Do you Know? UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) is a first- of-its kind scheme globally, designed to jump-start the regional aviation market. Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)- UDAN was conceived by the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), Government of India, to promote regional connectivity by making fly affordable for the common citizen. The ' central idea of the scheme is to encourage airlines to operate flights on regional and \"remote routes through enabling policies and I extending incentives. Communication Ever since humans appeared on the earth, they have used different means of communication. But, the pace of change, has been rapid in modern times. Long distance communication is far easier without physical movement of the communicator or receiver. Personal communication and mass communication including television, radio, press, films, etc. are the major means of communication in the country. The Indian postal network is the largest in the world. It handles parcels as well as personal written communications. Cards and envelopes are considered first-class mail and are airlifted between stations covering both land and air. The second-class mail includes book packets, registered newspapers and periodicals. They are carried by surface mail, covering land and water transport. To facilitate quick delivery of mails in large towns and cities, six mail channels have been introduced recently. They are called Rajdhani Channel, Metro Channel, Green Channel, Business Channel, Bulk Mail Channel and Periodical Channel. 68°E qe AFGHANISTAN 36°N INDIA MAJOR PORTS AND SOME PAKISTAN ; INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTS ape Xsriteuru Ram DagJee ‘international tN Airpert, Ane itsar tam 6 Tropic of Cancer ‘Nota Subhash Chandra Bose = ial ‘Haldia yA\\ iy l “: MYANMAR in “eS Chhatrapati Shively ws ARABIAN { Z fs BAY OF BENGAL 16° 12° New Mangalore * >? ° “s Pe 4 : ° ANDAMAN & NICOBAR ISLANDS LAKSHADWEEP (O.

International Trade The exchange of goods among people, states and countries is referred to as trade. The market is the place where such exchanges take place. Trade between two countries is called international trade. It may take place through sea, air or land routes. While local trade is carried in cities, towns and villages, state level trade is carried between two or more states. Advancement of international trade of a country is an index to its economic prosperity. It is, therefore, considered the economic barometer for a country. As the resources are space bound, no country can survive without international trade. Export and import are the components of trade. The balance of trade of a country is the difference between its export and import. When the value of export exceeds the value of imports, it is called a favourable balance of trade. On the contrary, if the value of imports exceeds the value of exports, it is termed as unfavourable balance of trade. India has trade relations with all the major trading blocks and all geographical regions of the world. The commodities exported from India to other countries include gems and jewellery, chemicals and related products, agriculture and allied products, etc. The commodities imported to India include petroleum crude and products, gems and jewellery, chemicals and related products, base metals, electronic items, machinery, agriculture and allied products. India has emerged as a software giant at the international level and it is earning large foreign exchange through the export of information technology. Tourism as a Trade Tourism in India has grown remarkably over the past two decades, with government initiatives, infrastructure development, and global branding contributing to this success. To boost tourism in India, schemes like Swadesh Darshan 2.O, Vibrant Village Programme, PRASHAD (Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Heritage Augmentation Drive), Paryatan Mitra, etc. have been started. Tourism also promotes national integration, provides support to local handicrafts and cultural pursuits. It also helps in the development of international understanding about our culture and heritage. Foreign tourists visit India for heritage tourism, eco tourism, adventure tourism, cultural tourism, medical tourism and business tourism. There is a vast potential for development of tourism in all parts of the country. Efforts are being made to promote different types of tourism for this upcoming industry.

Some of these are available in our\nimmediate surroundings, while other\nrequirements are met by bringing things from\nother places. Goods and services do not move\nfrom supply locales to demand locales on their\nown. The movement of these goods and services\nfrom their supply locations to demand locations\nnecessitates the need for transport. Some people\nare engaged in facilitating these movements.\nThese are known to be traders who make the\nproducts come to the consumers by\ntransportation. Thus, the pace of development\nof a country depends upon the production of\ngoods and services as well as their movement\nover space. Therefore, efficient means of transport\nare prerequisites for fast development.\nMovement of these goods and services can be\nover three important domains of our earth i.e. land,\nwater and air.

The growing importance of\nroad transport vis-a-vis rail transport is\nrooted in the following reasons; (a)\nconstruction cost of roads is much lower\nthan that of railway lines, (b) roads can\ntraverse comparatively more dissected and\nundulating topography, (c) roads can\nnegotiate higher gradients of slopes and as\nsuch can traverse mountains such as the\nHimalayas, (d) road transport is economical\nin transportation of few persons and\nrelatively smaller amount of goods over\nshort distances, (e) it also provides door-\nto-door service, thus the cost of loading\nand unloading is much lower, (f) road\ntransport is also used as a feeder to other\nmodes of transport such as they provide a\nlink between railway stations, air and\nsea ports.\n\nIn India, roads are classified in the\nfollowing six classes according to their\ncapacity. Look at the map of the National\nHighways and find out about the significant\nrole played by these roads.\n\n¢ Golden Quadrilateral Super Highways:\nThe government has launched a major\nroad development project linking Delhi-\nKolkata-Chennai-Mumbai and Delhi by\nsix-lane Super Highways. The North-\nSouth corridors linking Srinagar (Jammu\n& Kashmir) and Kanniyakumari (Tamil\nNadu), and East-West Corridor\nconnecting Silchar (Assam) and Porbander\n(Gujarat) are part of this project. The\nmajor objective of these Super Highways\nis to reduce the time and distance\nbetween the mega cities of India. These\nhighway projects are being implemented\nby the National Highway Authority of\nIndia (NHAI).\n\ne National Highways: National Highways\nlink extreme parts of the country. These\nare the primary road systems. A number\nof major National Highways run in North-\nSouth and East-West directions.\n\ne State Highways: Roads linking a state\ncapital with different district headquarters\nare known as State Highways.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig.7.2: Ahmedabad- Vadodara Expressway\n\nActivity ff.\n\nCollect information of National Highway\nnumbers (old and new) from the website\nmorth.nic.in/national-highway-details. The\nhistorical Sher-Shah Suri Marg between\nDelhi and Amritsar is known by which\nNational Highway ?\n\nDistrict Roads: These roads connect the\ndistrict headquarters with other places of\nthe district.\n\nOther Roads: Rural roads, which link rural\nareas and villages with towns, are classified\nunder this category. These roads received\nspecial impetus under the Pradhan Mantri\nGrameen Sadak Yojana. Under this scheme\nspecial provisions are made so that every\nvillage in the country is linked to a major\ntown in the country by an all season\nmotorable road.\n\nBorder Roads: Apart from these, Border\nRoads Organisation a Government of India\nundertaking constructs and maintains\nroads in the bordering areas of the\ncountry. This organisation was established\nin 1960 for the development of the roads\nof strategic importance in the northern and\nnorth-eastern border areas.

Apart from an important\nmeans of transport the Indian Railways\nhave been a great integrating force for more\nthan 150 years.

The northern plains with\ntheir vast level land, high population density\nand rich agricultural resources provided the most\nfavourable condition for their growth. However,\na large number of rivers requiring construction\nof bridges across their wide beds posed some\nobstacles. In the hilly terrains of the peninsular\nregion, railway tracts are laid through low hills,\ngaps or tunnels. The Himalayan mountainous\nregions too are unfavourable for the construction\nof railway lines due to high relief, sparse\npopulation and lack of economic opportunities.\nLikewise, it was difficult to lay railway lines on\nthe sandy plain of western Rajasthan, swamps\nof Gujarat, forested tracks of Madhya Pradesh,\nChhattisgarh, Odisha and Jharkhand.

In the past,\nthese were used to transport water to cities and\nindustries. Now, these are used for transporting\ncrude oil, petroleum products and natural gas\nfrom oil and natural gas fields to refineries,\nfertilizer factories and big thermal power plants.\nSolids can also be transported through a\npipeline when converted into slurry. The far\ninland locations of refineries like Barauni,\nMathura, Panipat and gas based fertilizer plants\ncould be thought of only because of pipelines.\nInitial cost of laying pipelines is high but\nsubsequent running costs are minimal. It rules\nout trans-shipment losses or delays.\n\nThere are three important networks of\npipeline transportation in the country.\n\ne From oil field in upper Assam to Kanpur\n(Uttar Pradesh), via Guwahati, Barauni and\nPrayagraj. It has branches from Barauni to\nHaldia, via Rajbandh, Rajbandh to\nMaurigram and Guwahati to Siliguri.\n\ne From Salaya in Gujarat to Jalandhar in\nPunjab, via Viramgam, Mathura, Delhi and\nSonipat. It has branches to connect Koyali\n(near Vadodara, Gujarat) Chakshu and\nother places.\n\ne The first 1,700 km long Hazira-Vijaipur-\nJagdishpur (HVJ) cross country gas\npipeline, linked Mumbai High and Bassein\ngas fields with various ferilizer, power and\nindustrial complexes in western and\nnorthern India. Overall, India’s gas pipeline\ninfrastructure has expanded from 1,700 km\nto 18,500 km of cross-country pipelines.\n\nWaterways\n\nSince the ancient period, India was one of the\nseafaring countries. Its seamen sailed far and\nnear, thus, carrying and spreading Indian\ncommerce and culture. Waterways are the\ncheapest means of transport. They are most\nsuitable for carrying heavy and bulky goods. It\nis a fuel-efficient and environment friendly mode\nof transport. India has inland navigation\nwaterways of 14,500 km in length. In order to\ncreate wide waterways network and to promote\ninland water transport in the country as an\neconomical environment friendly\nsupplementary mode of transport to rail and\nroad, 111 inland waterways (including 5\nNational Waterways declared earlier) were\ndeclared as National Waterways (NWs) by the\nNational Waterways Act, 2016.

The focus of Digital India\nProgramme is on being transformative to\nrealise — IT (Indian Talent) + IT (Information\nTechnology)=IT (India Tomorrow) and is\non making technology central to enabling\nchange.\n\nFig.7.10 : Emergency call box on NH-48\n\nIndia has one of the largest telecom\nnetworks in Asia. Excluding urban places more\nthan two-thirds of the villages in India have\nalready been covered with Subscriber Trunk\nDialling (STD) telephone facility. In order to\nstrengthen the flow of information from the\ngrassroot to the higher level, the government\nhas made special provision to extend twenty-\nfour hours STD facility to every village in the\ncountry. There is a uniform rate of STD\nfacilities all over India. It has\nbeen made possible by integrating the\ndevelopment in space technology with\ncommunication technology.\n\nMass communication provides\nentertainment and creates awareness among\npeople about various national programmes\nand policies. It includes radio, television,\nnewspapers, magazines, books and films. All\nIndia Radio (Akashwani) broadcasts a variety\nof programmes in national, regional and local\nlanguages for various categories of people,\nspread over different parts of the country.\nDoordarshan, the national television channel\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nof India, is one of the largest terrestrial\nnetworks in the world. It broadcasts a variety\nof programmes from entertainment,\neducational to sports, etc. for people of different\nage groups.\n\nIndia publishes a large number of\nnewspapers and periodicals annually. They\nare of different types depending upon their\nperiodicity. Newspapers are published in\nabout 100 languages and dialects. Did you\nknow that the largest number of newspapers\npublished in the country are in Hindi, followed\nby English and Urdu? India is the largest\nproducer of feature films in the world. It\nproduces short films; video feature films and\nvideo short films. The Central Board of Film\nCertification is the authority to certify both\nIndian and foreign films.\n\nInternational Trade\n\nThe exchange of goods among people, states\nand countries is referred to as trade. The\nmarket is the place where such exchanges\ntake place. Trade between two countries is\ncalled international trade. It may take place\nthrough sea, air or land routes. While local\ntrade is carried in cities, towns and villages,\nstate level trade is carried between two or more\nstates. Advancement of international trade of\na country is an index to its economic\nprosperity. It is, therefore, considered the\neconomic barometer for a country.\n\nAs the resources are space bound, no\ncountry can survive without international\ntrade. Export and import are the components\nof trade. The balance of trade of a country is\nthe difference between its export and import.\nWhen the value of export exceeds the value\nof imports, it is called a favourable balance\nof trade. On the contrary, if the value of\nimports exceeds the value of exports, it is\ntermed as unfavourable balance of trade.\n\nIndia has trade relations with all the major\ntrading blocks and all geographical regions\nof the world. The commodities exported from\nIndia to other countries include gems and\njewellery, chemicals and related products,\nagriculture and allied products, etc.\n",

The syllabi and textbooks developed on\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system\nof education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own\nlearning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must\nrecognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one\nof the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat\nchildren as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of\nknowledge.\n\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode\nof functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour\nin implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of\nteaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for\nteaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook\nproves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather\nthan a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to\naddress the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and\nreorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for\nchild psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook\nattempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space\nto opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small\ngroups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\n\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the\nadvisory committee for textbooks in Social Sciences, at the higher\nsecondary level, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for this\nbook, Professor M.H. Qureshi for guiding the work of this committee.\nSeveral teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are\ngrateful to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nthe institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw\nupon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the\nmembers of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department\nof Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development\nunder the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P.\nDeshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an organisation\ncommitted to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its\nproducts, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to\nundertake further revision and refinement.\n\nDirector\nNew Delhi National Council of Educational\n20 November 2006 Research and Training\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce\ncontent load on students.

This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986). The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory committee for textbooks in Social Sciences, at the higher secondary level, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor M.H. Qureshi for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to Reprint 2O25-26 the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution.

Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.

We wish to thank the Chairperson of the\nadvisory committee for textbooks in Social Sciences, at the higher\nsecondary level, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for this\nbook, Professor M.H. Qureshi for guiding the work of this committee.\nSeveral teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are\ngrateful to their principals for making this possible.

Learning Outcomes\nalready developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken\ninto consideration in this exercise.\n\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of\nthe following:\n\n° Overlapping with similar content included in other subject\n\nareas in the same class\n\n° Similar content included in the lower or higher class in\nthe same subject\n\ne Difficulty level\n\n° Content, which is easily accessible to students without\nmuch interventions from teachers and can be learned by\nchildren through self-learning or peer-learning\n\n° Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\n\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying\nout the changes given above.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",
