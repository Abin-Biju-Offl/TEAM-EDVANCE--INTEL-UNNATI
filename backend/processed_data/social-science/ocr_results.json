It was\nbelieved that resources are free gifts of nature.\nAs a result, human beings used them\nindiscriminately and this has led to the\nfollowing major problems.\n\ne Depletion of resources for satisfying the\ngreed of a few individuals.\n\ne Accumulation ofresources in few hands, which,\nin turn, divided the society into two segments\ni.e. haves and have nots or rich and poor.\n\ne Indiscriminate exploitation of resources has\nled to global ecological crises such as, global\nwarming, ozone layer depletion, environmental\npollution and land degradation.\n\nActivity\n\n1. Imagine, if the oil supply gets exhausted\none day, how would this affect our life style?\n2. Plan a survey in your colony/village to |\ninvestigate people’s attitude towards\nrecycling of the domestic/agricultural\nwastes. Ask questions about :\n(a) What do they think about resources\nthey use?\n(b) What is their opinion about the |\nwastes, and its utilisation?\n(c) Collage your results.\n\nAn equitable distribution of resources has\nbecome essential for a sustained quality of life\nand global peace. If the present trend of\nresource depletion by a few individuals and\ncountries continues, the future of our planet\nis in danger.\n\nTherefore, resource planning is essential for\nsustainable existence of all forms of life.\nSustainable existence is a component of\nsustainable development.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\n(YA oO\n\neo\nSustainable development 4\n\nSustainable economic development means\n‘development should take place without\ndamaging the environment, and development\nin the present should not compromise with the\nneeds of the future generations.’\n\nRio de Janeiro Earth Summit, 1992\n\nIn June 1992, more than 100 heads of states\nmet in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, for the first\nInternational Earth Summit. The Summit was\nconvened for addressing urgent problems of\nenvironmental protection and socio-\neconomic development at the global level.\nThe assembled leaders signed the\nDeclaration on Global Climatic Change and\nBiological Diversity. The Rio Convention\nendorsed the global Forest Principles and\nadopted Agenda 21 for achieving\nSustainable Development in the 21* century.\n\nAgenda 21\n\nIt is the declaration signed by world leaders\nin 1992 at the United Nations Conference\non Environment and Development (UNCED),\nwhich took place at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It\naims at achieving global sustainable\ndevelopment. It is an agenda to combat\nenvironmental damage, poverty, disease\nthrough global co-operation on common\ninterests, mutual needs and shared\n- responsibilities. One major objective of the\n\nshould draw its own local Agenda 21.\n\n5 Agenda 21 is that every local government\n\nRESOURCE PLANNING\n\nPlanning is the widely accepted strategy for\njudicious use of resources. It has importance\nin a country like India, which has enormous\ndiversity in the availability of resources. There\nare regions which are rich in certain types of\nresources but are deficient in some other\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nresources. There are some regions which can\nbe considered self sufficient in terms of the\navailability of resources and there are some\nregions which have acute shortage of some vital\nresources. For example, the states of\nJharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya\nPradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits.\nArunachal Pradesh has abundance of water\nresources but lacks in infrastructural\ndevelopment. The state of Rajasthan is very well\nendowed with solar and wind energy but lacks\nin water resources. The cold desert of Ladakh\nis relatively isolated from the rest of the\ncountry. It has very rich cultural heritage but\nit is deficient in water, infrastructure and some\nvital minerals. This calls for balanced resource\nplanning at the national, state, regional and\nlocal levels.\n\nActivity\n\nPrepare a list of resources found in your state\nand also identify the resources that are\nimportant but deficit in your state.\n\nResource Planning in India\n\nResource planning is a complex process\nwhich involves : (i) identification and\ninventory of resources across the regions of\nthe country. This involves surveying,\nmapping and qualitative and quantitative\nestimation and measurement of the\nresources. (ii) Evolving a planning structure\nendowed with appropriate technology, skill\nand institutional set up for implementing\nresource development plans. (iii) Matching\nthe resource development plans with overall\nnational development plans.\n\nIndia has made concerted efforts for\nachieving the goals of resource planning right\nfrom the First Five Year Plan launched after\nIndependence.\n\nThe availability of resources is a necessary\ncondition for the development of any region,\nbut mere availability of resources in the\nabsence of corresponding changes in\n\nFind out\n\nWhat resources are being developed in your\nsurroundings by the community/village\npanchayats/ward level communities with the\nhelp of community participation?\n\ntechnology and institutions may hinder\ndevelopment. There are many regions in our\ncountry that are rich in resources but these\nare included in economically backward\nregions. On the contrary there are some regions\nwhich have a poor resource base but they are\neconomically developed.\n\nCan you name some resource rich but\neconomically backward regions and some\nresource poor but economically developed\nregions? Give reasons for such a situation.\n\nThe history of colonisation reveals that\nrich resources in colonies were the main\nattractions for the foreign invaders. It was\nprimarily the higher level of technological\ndevelopment of the colonising countries that\nhelped them to exploit resources of other\nregions and establish their supremacy over\nthe colonies. Therefore, resources can\ncontribute to development only when they are\naccompanied by appropriate technological\ndevelopment and institutional changes. India\nhas experienced all this in different phases of\ncolonisation. Therefore, in India, development,\nin general, and resource development in\nparticular does not only involve the\navailability of resources, but also the\ntechnology, quality of human resources and\nthe historical experiences of the people.\n\nConservation of Resources: Resources are\nvital for any developmental activity. But\nirrational consumption and over-utilisation\nof resources may lead to socio-economic and\nenvironmental problems. To overcome these\nproblems, resource conservation at various\nlevels is important. This had been the main\nconcern of the leaders and thinkers in the\npast. For example, Gandhiji was very apt in\nvoicing his concern about resource ~\nconservation in these words: “There is enough\n\nRESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nfor everybody’s need and not for any body’s\ngreed.” He placed the greedy and selfish\nindividuals and exploitative nature of modern\ntechnology as the root cause for resource\ndepletion at the global level. He was against\nmass production and wanted to replace it with\nthe production by the masses.\n\n]\n\nAt the international level, the Club of Rome \\\nadvocated resource conservation for the first —\ntime in a more systematic way in 1968.\nSubsequently, in 1974, Gandhian philosophy\nwas once again presented by Schumacher\nin his book Small is Beautiful. The seminal\ncontribution with respect to resource\nconservation at the global level was made\nby the Brundtland Commission Report, 1987.\nThis report introduced the concept of\n‘Sustainable Development’ and advocated\nit as a means for resource conservation,\nwhich was subsequently published in a book\nentitled Our Common Future. Another\n\nsignificant contribution was made at the Earth\nSummit at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992.\nLAND RESOURCES\n\nWe live on land, we perform our economic\nactivities on land and we use it in different\nways. Thus, land is a natural resource of\nutmost importance. It supports natural\nvegetation, wild life, human life, economic\nactivities, transport and communication\nsystems. However, land is an asset of a finite\nmagnitude, therefore, it is important to use the\n\n[] Plains\n[| Mountains\n\n[ ] Plateaus\n\n30%\n\nFig 1.3: India : Land under important Relief\nFeatures\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\navailable land for various purposes with careful\nplanning.\n\nIndia has land under a variety of relief\nfeatures, namely; mountains, plateaus, plains\nand islands. About 43 per cent of the land area\nis plain, which provides facilities for agriculture\nand industry. Mountains account for 30 per\ncent of the total surface area of the country and\nensure perennial flow of some rivers, provide\nfacilities for tourism and ecological aspects.\nAbout 27 per cent of the area of the country is\nthe plateau region. It possesses rich reserves\nof minerals, fossil fuels and forests.\n\nLanbD UTILISATION\n\nLand resources are used for the following\npurposes:\n\n1. Forests\n\n2. Land not available for cultivation\n(a) Barren and waste land\n(b) Land put to non-agricultural uses, e.g.\nbuildings, roads, factories, etc.\n3.

Land use data, however, is\navailable only for 93 per cent of the total\ngeographical area because the land use\nreporting for most of the north-east states\nexcept Assam has not been done fully.\nMoreover, some areas of Jammu and Kashmir\noccupied by Pakistan and China have also not\nbeen surveyed.\n\nActivity\nTry to do a comparison between the two pie\ncharts (Fig. 1.4 ) given for land use and find\nout why the net sown area and the land\nunder forests have changed from 1960-61\nto 2019-20 very marginally.\n\nThe land under permanent pasture has\nalso decreased.

Hence, these lands\nare cultivated once or twice in about two to\nthree years and if these are included in the\nnet sown area then the percentage of NSA in\nIndia comes to about 54 per cent of the total\nreporting area.\n\nThe pattern of net sown area varies greatly\nfrom one state to another.

A part\nof the land is termed as waste land and land\nput to other non-agricultural uses. Waste land\nincludes rocky, arid and desert areas and land\nput to other non-agricultural uses includes\nsettlements, roads, railways, industry etc.\nContinuous use of land over a long period of\ntime without taking appropriate measures to\nconserve and manage it, has resulted in land\ndegradation. This, in turn, has serious\nrepercussions on _ society and the\nenvironment.\n\nLAND DEGRADATION AND CONSERVATION\nMEASURES\n\nWe have shared our land with the past\ngenerations and will have to do so with the future\ngenerations too. Ninety-five per cent of our basic\nneeds for food, shelter and clothing are obtained\nfrom land. Human activities have not only\nbrought about degradation of land but have\nalso aggravated the pace of natural forces to\ncause damage to land.\n\nSome human activities such as\ndeforestation, over grazing, mining and\nquarrying too have contributed significantly in\nland degradation.\n\nMining sites are abandoned after\nexcavation work is complete leaving deep\nscars and traces of over-burdening. In states\nlike Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya\nPradesh and Odisha deforestation due to\nmining have caused severe land degradation.\nIn states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya\nPradesh and Maharashtra overgrazing is one\nof the main reasons for land degradation. In\nthe states of Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar\nPradesh, over irrigation is responsible for land\ndegradation due to water logging leading to\nincrease in salinity and alkalinity in the soil.\nThe mineral processing like grinding of\nlimestone for cement industry and calcite and\nsoapstone for ceramic industry generate huge\nquantity of dust in the atmosphere. It retards\nthe process of infiltration of water into the soil\nafter it settles down on the land. In recent\nyears, industrial effluents as waste have\nbecome a major source of land and water\npollution in many parts of the country.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nThere are many ways to solve the problems\nof land degradation. Afforestation and proper\nmanagement of grazing can help to some extent.\nPlanting of shelter belts of plants, control on\nover grazing, stabilisation of sand dunes by\ngrowing thorny bushes are some of the\nmethods to check land degradation in arid\nareas. Proper management of waste lands,\ncontrol of mining activities, proper discharge\nand disposal of industrial effluents and wastes\nafter treatment can reduce land and water\ndegradation in industrial and suburban areas.\n\nSor as A RESOURCE\n\nSoil is the most important renewable natural\nresource. It is the medium of plant growth\nand supports different types of living organisms\non the earth. The soil is a living system. It\ntakes millions of years to form soil upto a few\ncm in depth. Relief, parent rock or bed rock,\nclimate, vegetation and other forms of life and\ntime are important factors in the formation of\nsoil. Various forces of nature such as change\nin temperature, actions of running water, wind\nand glaciers, activities of decomposers etc.\ncontribute to the formation of soil. Chemical\nand organic changes which take place in the\n\n-\\ Unweathered  « A\n\\_/ «parent bed rock\noe Sa eee ah\nam ee > =~ § a Sed\n\nFig. 1.5: Soil Profile\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nsoil are equally important. Soil also consists\nof organic (humus) and inorganic materials\n(Fig. 1.5).\n\nOn the basis of the factors responsible for\nsoil formation, colour, thickness, texture, age,\nchemical and physical properties, the soils of\nIndia are classified in different types.\n\nClassification of Soils\n\nIndia has varied relief features, landforms,\nclimatic realms and vegetation types. These\nhave contributed in the development of various\ntypes of soils.\n\nAlluvial Soils\n\nThis is the most widely spread and important\nsoil. In fact, the entire northern plains are\nmade of alluvial soil. These have been\ndeposited by three important Himalayan river\nsystems- the Indus, the Ganga and the\nBrahmaputra. These soils also extend in\nRajasthan and Gujarat through a narrow\ncorridor. Alluvial soil is also found in the\n\neastern coastal plains particularly in the deltas\nof the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna\nand the Kaveri rivers.\n\nFig. 1.6: Alluvial Soil\n\nThe alluvial soil consists of various\nproportions of sand, silt and clay. As we move\ninlands towards the river valleys, soil particles\nappear some what bigger in size. In the upper\nreaches of the river valley i.e. near the place\nof the break of slope, the soils are coarse. Such\nsoils are more common in piedmont plains\nsuch as Duars, Chos and Terai.\n\nApart from the size of their grains or\ncomponents, soils are also described on the\nbasis of their age. According to their age\nalluvial soils can be classified as old alluvial\n(Bangar) and new alluvial (Khadar). The\nbangar soil has higher concentration of kanker\n\nnodules than the Khadar. It has more fine\nparticles and is more fertile than the bangar.\n\nAlluvial soils as a whole are very fertile.\nMostly these soils contain adequate proportion\nof potash, phosphoric acid and lime which\nare ideal for the growth of sugarcane, paddy,\nwheat and other cereal and pulse crops. Due\nto its high fertility, regions of alluvial soils are\nintensively cultivated and densely populated.\nSoils in the drier areas are more alkaline and\ncan be productive after proper treatment and\nirrigation.\n\nBlack Soil\n\nThese soils are black in colour and are also\nknown as regur soils. Black soil is ideal for\ngrowing cotton and is also known as black\ncotton soil. It is believed that climatic condition\nalong with the parent rock material are the\nimportant factors for the formation of black\nsoil. This type of soil is typical of the Deccan\ntrap (Basalt) region spread over northwest\nDeccan plateau and is made up of lava flows.\nThey cover the plateaus of Maharashtra,\nSaurashtra, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh and\nChhattisgarh and extend in the south east\ndirection along the Godavari and the Krishna\nvalleys.\n\nFig. 1.7: Black Soil\n\nThe black soils are made up of extremely\nfine i.e. clayey material. They are well-known\nfor their capacity to hold moisture. In addition,\n\nthey are rich in soil nutrients, such as calcium ¥\n\ncarbonate, magnesium, potash and lime.

Yellow\nand red soils are also found in parts of\nOdisha, Chhattisgarh, southern parts of the\nmiddle Ganga plain and along the piedmont\nzone of the Western Ghats. These soils develop\na reddish colour due to diffusion of iron in\ncrystalline and metamorphic rocks. It looks\nyellow when it occurs in a hydrated form.\n\nLaterite Soil\n\nLaterite has been derived from the Latin word\n‘later’ which means brick. The laterite soil\ndevelops under tropical and subtropical\nclimate with alternate wet and dry season.\nThis soil is the result of intense leaching due\nto heavy rain. Lateritic soils are mostly deep\nto very deep, acidic (pH<6.0), generally\ndeficient in plant nutrients and occur mostly\nin southern states, Western Ghats region of\nMaharashtra, Odisha, some parts of West\nBengal and North-east regions. Where these\nsoils support deciduous and evergreen\nforests, it is humus rich, but under sparse\n\nFig. 1.8: Laterite Soil\n\nvegetation and in semi-arid environment, it is\ngenerally humus poor. They are prone to\nerosion and degradation due to their position\non the landscape. After adopting appropriate\nsoil conservation techniques particularly in\nthe hilly areas of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil\nNadu, this soil is very useful for growing tea\nand coffee. Red laterite soils in Tamil Nadu,\nAndhra Pradesh and Kerala are more suitable\nfor crops like cashew nut.\n\nArid Soils\n\nArid soils range from red to brown in colour.\nThey are generally sandy in texture and saline\nin nature. In some areas the salt content is\nvery high and common salt is obtained by\nevaporating the water. Due to the dry climate,\nhigh temperature, evaporation is faster and\nthe soil lacks humus and moisture. The lower\nhorizons of the soil are occupied by Kankar\nbecause of the increasing calcium content\ndownwards. The Kankar layer formations in\nthe bottom horizons restrict the infiltration of\nwater. After proper irrigation these soils\nbecome cultivable as has been in the case of\nwestern Rajasthan.\n\nFig. 1.9: Arid Soil\n\nForest Soils\n\nThese soils are found in the hilly and\nmountainous areas where sufficient rain\nforests are available. The soils texture varies\naccording to the mountain environment\nwhere they are formed. They are loamy and\n\nsilty in valley sides and coarse grained in\n\nthe upper slopes. In the snow covered areas\n\nRESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nof Himalayas, these soils experience\ndenudation and are acidic with low humus\ncontent. The soils found in the lower parts of\nthe valleys particularly on the river terraces\nand alluvial fans are fertile.\n\nSoil Erosion and Soil Conservation\n\nThe denudation of the soil cover and\nsubsequent washing down is described as soil\nerosion. The processes of soil formation and\nerosion, go on simultaneously and generally\nthere is a balance between the two. Sometimes,\nthis balance is disturbed due to human\nactivities like deforestation, over-grazing,\nconstruction and mining etc., while natural\nforces like wind, glacier and water lead to\nsoil erosion. The running water cuts through\nthe clayey soils and makes deep channels as\ngullies. The land becomes unfit for cultivation\nand is known as bad land. In the Chambal\n\nbasin such lands are called ravines.\nSometimes water flows as a sheet over large\nareas down a slope. In such cases the top\n\nFig. 1.10: Soil Erosion\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig. 1.11: Gully Erosion\n\nsoil is washed away. This is known as sheet\nerosion. Wind blows loose soil off flat or\nsloping land known as wind erosion. Soil\nerosion is also caused due to defective methods\nof farming. Ploughing in a wrong way i.e. up\nand down the slope form channels for the\nquick flow of water leading to soil erosion.\n\nPloughing along the contour lines can\ndecelerate the flow of water down the slopes.\nThis is called contour ploughing. Steps can\nbe cut out on the slopes making terraces.\nTerrace cultivation restricts erosion. Western\nand central Himalayas have well developed\nterrace farming. Large fields can be divided into\nstrips. Strips of grass are left to grow between\nthe crops. This breaks up the force of the wind.\nThis method is known as strip cropping.\nPlanting lines of trees to create shelter also\nworks in a similar way. Rows of such trees are\ncalled shelter belts. These shelter belts have\ncontributed significantly to the stabilisation of\nsand dunes and in stabilising the desert in\nwestern India.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nExercises EXERCISES Exercises\n\n1.

There are some regions which can\nbe considered self sufficient in terms of the\navailability of resources and there are some\nregions which have acute shortage of some vital\nresources. For example, the states of\nJharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya\nPradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits.\nArunachal Pradesh has abundance of water\nresources but lacks in infrastructural\ndevelopment. The state of Rajasthan is very well\nendowed with solar and wind energy but lacks\nin water resources. The cold desert of Ladakh\nis relatively isolated from the rest of the\ncountry. It has very rich cultural heritage but\nit is deficient in water, infrastructure and some\nvital minerals. This calls for balanced resource\nplanning at the national, state, regional and\nlocal levels.\n\nActivity\n\nPrepare a list of resources found in your state\nand also identify the resources that are\nimportant but deficit in your state.\n\nResource Planning in India\n\nResource planning is a complex process\nwhich involves : (i) identification and\ninventory of resources across the regions of\nthe country. This involves surveying,\nmapping and qualitative and quantitative\nestimation and measurement of the\nresources. (ii) Evolving a planning structure\nendowed with appropriate technology, skill\nand institutional set up for implementing\nresource development plans. (iii) Matching\nthe resource development plans with overall\nnational development plans.\n\nIndia has made concerted efforts for\nachieving the goals of resource planning right\nfrom the First Five Year Plan launched after\nIndependence.\n\nThe availability of resources is a necessary\ncondition for the development of any region,\nbut mere availability of resources in the\nabsence of corresponding changes in\n\nFind out\n\nWhat resources are being developed in your\nsurroundings by the community/village\npanchayats/ward level communities with the\nhelp of community participation?\n\ntechnology and institutions may hinder\ndevelopment. There are many regions in our\ncountry that are rich in resources but these\nare included in economically backward\nregions. On the contrary there are some regions\nwhich have a poor resource base but they are\neconomically developed.\n\nCan you name some resource rich but\neconomically backward regions and some\nresource poor but economically developed\nregions? Give reasons for such a situation.\n\nThe history of colonisation reveals that\nrich resources in colonies were the main\nattractions for the foreign invaders. It was\nprimarily the higher level of technological\ndevelopment of the colonising countries that\nhelped them to exploit resources of other\nregions and establish their supremacy over\nthe colonies. Therefore, resources can\ncontribute to development only when they are\naccompanied by appropriate technological\ndevelopment and institutional changes. India\nhas experienced all this in different phases of\ncolonisation. Therefore, in India, development,\nin general, and resource development in\nparticular does not only involve the\navailability of resources, but also the\ntechnology, quality of human resources and\nthe historical experiences of the people.\n\nConservation of Resources: Resources are\nvital for any developmental activity. But\nirrational consumption and over-utilisation\nof resources may lead to socio-economic and\nenvironmental problems. To overcome these\nproblems, resource conservation at various\nlevels is important. This had been the main\nconcern of the leaders and thinkers in the\npast.

Waste land\nincludes rocky, arid and desert areas and land\nput to other non-agricultural uses includes\nsettlements, roads, railways, industry etc.\nContinuous use of land over a long period of\ntime without taking appropriate measures to\nconserve and manage it, has resulted in land\ndegradation. This, in turn, has serious\nrepercussions on _ society and the\nenvironment.\n\nLAND DEGRADATION AND CONSERVATION\nMEASURES\n\nWe have shared our land with the past\ngenerations and will have to do so with the future\ngenerations too. Ninety-five per cent of our basic\nneeds for food, shelter and clothing are obtained\nfrom land. Human activities have not only\nbrought about degradation of land but have\nalso aggravated the pace of natural forces to\ncause damage to land.\n\nSome human activities such as\ndeforestation, over grazing, mining and\nquarrying too have contributed significantly in\nland degradation.\n\nMining sites are abandoned after\nexcavation work is complete leaving deep\nscars and traces of over-burdening. In states\nlike Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya\nPradesh and Odisha deforestation due to\nmining have caused severe land degradation.\nIn states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya\nPradesh and Maharashtra overgrazing is one\nof the main reasons for land degradation. In\nthe states of Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar\nPradesh, over irrigation is responsible for land\ndegradation due to water logging leading to\nincrease in salinity and alkalinity in the soil.\nThe mineral processing like grinding of\nlimestone for cement industry and calcite and\nsoapstone for ceramic industry generate huge\nquantity of dust in the atmosphere. It retards\nthe process of infiltration of water into the soil\nafter it settles down on the land. In recent\nyears, industrial effluents as waste have\nbecome a major source of land and water\npollution in many parts of the country.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nThere are many ways to solve the problems\nof land degradation. Afforestation and proper\nmanagement of grazing can help to some extent.\nPlanting of shelter belts of plants, control on\nover grazing, stabilisation of sand dunes by\ngrowing thorny bushes are some of the\nmethods to check land degradation in arid\nareas. Proper management of waste lands,\ncontrol of mining activities, proper discharge\nand disposal of industrial effluents and wastes\nafter treatment can reduce land and water\ndegradation in industrial and suburban areas.\n\nSor as A RESOURCE\n\nSoil is the most important renewable natural\nresource.

Soil also consists\nof organic (humus) and inorganic materials\n(Fig. 1.5).\n\nOn the basis of the factors responsible for\nsoil formation, colour, thickness, texture, age,\nchemical and physical properties, the soils of\nIndia are classified in different types.\n\nClassification of Soils\n\nIndia has varied relief features, landforms,\nclimatic realms and vegetation types. These\nhave contributed in the development of various\ntypes of soils.\n\nAlluvial Soils\n\nThis is the most widely spread and important\nsoil. In fact, the entire northern plains are\nmade of alluvial soil. These have been\ndeposited by three important Himalayan river\nsystems- the Indus, the Ganga and the\nBrahmaputra. These soils also extend in\nRajasthan and Gujarat through a narrow\ncorridor. Alluvial soil is also found in the\n\neastern coastal plains particularly in the deltas\nof the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna\nand the Kaveri rivers.\n\nFig. 1.6: Alluvial Soil\n\nThe alluvial soil consists of various\nproportions of sand, silt and clay. As we move\ninlands towards the river valleys, soil particles\nappear some what bigger in size. In the upper\nreaches of the river valley i.e. near the place\nof the break of slope, the soils are coarse. Such\nsoils are more common in piedmont plains\nsuch as Duars, Chos and Terai.\n\nApart from the size of their grains or\ncomponents, soils are also described on the\nbasis of their age. According to their age\nalluvial soils can be classified as old alluvial\n(Bangar) and new alluvial (Khadar). The\nbangar soil has higher concentration of kanker\n\nnodules than the Khadar. It has more fine\nparticles and is more fertile than the bangar.\n\nAlluvial soils as a whole are very fertile.\nMostly these soils contain adequate proportion\nof potash, phosphoric acid and lime which\nare ideal for the growth of sugarcane, paddy,\nwheat and other cereal and pulse crops. Due\nto its high fertility, regions of alluvial soils are\nintensively cultivated and densely populated.\nSoils in the drier areas are more alkaline and\ncan be productive after proper treatment and\nirrigation.\n\nBlack Soil\n\nThese soils are black in colour and are also\nknown as regur soils. Black soil is ideal for\ngrowing cotton and is also known as black\ncotton soil. It is believed that climatic condition\nalong with the parent rock material are the\nimportant factors for the formation of black\nsoil. This type of soil is typical of the Deccan\ntrap (Basalt) region spread over northwest\nDeccan plateau and is made up of lava flows.\nThey cover the plateaus of Maharashtra,\nSaurashtra, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh and\nChhattisgarh and extend in the south east\ndirection along the Godavari and the Krishna\nvalleys.\n\nFig. 1.7: Black Soil\n\nThe black soils are made up of extremely\nfine i.e. clayey material. They are well-known\nfor their capacity to hold moisture. In addition,\n\nthey are rich in soil nutrients, such as calcium ¥\n\ncarbonate, magnesium, potash and lime.

Yellow\nand red soils are also found in parts of\nOdisha, Chhattisgarh, southern parts of the\nmiddle Ganga plain and along the piedmont\nzone of the Western Ghats. These soils develop\na reddish colour due to diffusion of iron in\ncrystalline and metamorphic rocks.

The laterite soil\ndevelops under tropical and subtropical\nclimate with alternate wet and dry season.\nThis soil is the result of intense leaching due\nto heavy rain. Lateritic soils are mostly deep\nto very deep, acidic (pH<6.0), generally\ndeficient in plant nutrients and occur mostly\nin southern states, Western Ghats region of\nMaharashtra, Odisha, some parts of West\nBengal and North-east regions.

They are prone to\nerosion and degradation due to their position\non the landscape. After adopting appropriate\nsoil conservation techniques particularly in\nthe hilly areas of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil\nNadu, this soil is very useful for growing tea\nand coffee. Red laterite soils in Tamil Nadu,\nAndhra Pradesh and Kerala are more suitable\nfor crops like cashew nut.\n\nArid Soils\n\nArid soils range from red to brown in colour.\nThey are generally sandy in texture and saline\nin nature. In some areas the salt content is\nvery high and common salt is obtained by\nevaporating the water. Due to the dry climate,\nhigh temperature, evaporation is faster and\nthe soil lacks humus and moisture. The lower\nhorizons of the soil are occupied by Kankar\nbecause of the increasing calcium content\ndownwards. The Kankar layer formations in\nthe bottom horizons restrict the infiltration of\nwater.

The processes of soil formation and\nerosion, go on simultaneously and generally\nthere is a balance between the two. Sometimes,\nthis balance is disturbed due to human\nactivities like deforestation, over-grazing,\nconstruction and mining etc., while natural\nforces like wind, glacier and water lead to\nsoil erosion.

In such cases the top\n\nFig. 1.10: Soil Erosion\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig. 1.11: Gully Erosion\n\nsoil is washed away. This is known as sheet\nerosion. Wind blows loose soil off flat or\nsloping land known as wind erosion. Soil\nerosion is also caused due to defective methods\nof farming. Ploughing in a wrong way i.e. up\nand down the slope form channels for the\nquick flow of water leading to soil erosion.\n\nPloughing along the contour lines can\ndecelerate the flow of water down the slopes.\nThis is called contour ploughing. Steps can\nbe cut out on the slopes making terraces.\nTerrace cultivation restricts erosion. Western\nand central Himalayas have well developed\nterrace farming. Large fields can be divided into\nstrips. Strips of grass are left to grow between\nthe crops. This breaks up the force of the wind.\nThis method is known as strip cropping.\nPlanting lines of trees to create shelter also\nworks in a similar way. Rows of such trees are\ncalled shelter belts.

It also preserves the genetic diversity of\nplants and animals for better growth of species\nand breeding. For example, in agriculture,\nwe are still dependent on traditional crop\nvarieties. Fisheries too are heavily dependent\non the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, conservationists\ndemanded a national wildlife protection\nprogramme.

An all-\nIndia list of protected species was also\npublished. The thrust of the programme was\ntowards protecting the remaining population\nof certain endangered species by banning\nhunting, giving legal protection to their\nhabitats, and restricting trade in wildlife.\nSubsequently, central and many state\ngovernments established national parks and\nwildlife sanctuaries about which you have\nalready studied. The central government also\nannounced several projects for protecting\nspecific animals, which were gravely\nthreatened, including the tiger, the one-\nhorned rhinoceros, the Kashmir stag or\nhangul, three types of crocodiles — fresh\nwater crocodile, saltwater crocodile and the\nGharial, the Asiatic lion, and others. Most\nrecently, the Indian elephant, black buck\n(chinkara), the great Indian bustard\n(godawan) and the snow leopard, etc. have\n\n~ been given full or partial legal protection\n\n{wv against hunting and trade throughout India.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\ntd\nProject Tiger\nTiger is one of the key wildlife species in\n\nthe faunal web. In 1973, the authorities\nrealised that the tiger population had\ndwindled to 1,827 from an estimated\n55,000 at the turn of the century. The major\nthreats to tiger population are numerous,\nsuch as poaching for trade, shrinking\nhabitat, depletion of prey base species,\ngrowing human population, etc. The trade\nof tiger skins and the use of their bones in\ntraditional medicines, especially in the\nAsian countries left the tiger population on\nthe verge of extinction. Since India and\nNepal provide habitat to about two-thirds\nof the surviving tiger population in the\nworld, these two nations became prime\ntargets for poaching and illegal trading.\n“Project Tiger”, one of the well-\npublicised wildlife campaigns in the world,\nwas launched in 1973. Tiger conservation\nhas been viewed not only as an effort to\nsave an endangered species, but with\n\n\n\nFig. 2.2: Rhino and deer in Kaziranga National Park\n\nequal importance as a means of\npreserving biotypes of sizeable magnitude.\nCorbett National Park in Uttarakhand,\nSunderbans National Park in West Bengal,\nBandhavgarh National Park in Madhya\nPradesh, Sariska Wildlife Sanctuary in\nRajasthan, Manas Tiger Reserve in Assam\n\ne . . .\nand Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala are\n} some of the tiger reserves of India.\n\nThe conservation projects are now focusing\non biodiversity rather than on a few of its\ncomponents. There is now a more intensive\nsearch for different conservation measures.\nIncreasingly, even insects are beginning to find\na place in conservation planning. In the\nnotification under Wildlife Act of 1980 and\n1986, several hundred butterflies, moths,\nbeetles, and one dragonfly have been added to\nthe list of protected species. In 1991, for the\nfirst time plants were also added to the list,\nstarting with six species.\n\n- Activity\nCollect more information on the wildlife\nsanctuaries and national parks of India and\ncite their locations on the map of India.\n\nTypes and Distribution of Forest and\nWildlife Resources\n\nEven if we want to conserve our vast forest and\nwildlife resources, it is rather difficult to\nmanage, control and regulate them. In India,\n\nmuch of its forest and wildlife resources are\neither owned or managed by the government\nthrough the Forest Department or other\ngovernment departments. These are classified\nunder the following categories.\n\n(j) Reserved Forests: More than half of the\ntotal forest land has been declared\nreserved forests. Reserved forests are\nregarded as the most valuable as far as the\nconservation of forest and wildlife resources\nare concerned.\n\n(ii) Protected Forests: Almost one-third of the\ntotal forest area is protected forest, as\ndeclared by the Forest Department. This\nforest land are protected from any further\ndepletion.\n\n(iii) Unclassed Forests: These are other\nforests and wastelands belonging to\nboth government and private individuals\nand communities.\n\nReserved and protected forests are also\nreferred to as permanent forest estates\nmaintained for the purpose of producing\ntimber and other forest produce, and for\nprotective reasons. Madhya Pradesh has the\nlargest area under permanent forests,\nconstituting 75 per cent of its total forest area.\nJammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh,\nUttarakhand, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West\nBengal, and Maharashtra have large\npercentages of reserved forests of its total forest\narea whereas Bihar, Haryana, Punjab, |\nHimachal Pradesh, Odisha and Rajasthan have\n\na bulk of it under protected forests.

We often ignore that in India, forests\nare also home to some of the traditional\ncommunities. In some areas of India, local\ncommunities are struggling to conserve these\nhabitats along with government officials,\nrecognising that only this will secure their\nown long-term livelihood. In Sariska Tiger\nReserve, Rajasthan, villagers have fought\nagainst mining by citing the Wildlife Protection\nAct. In many areas, villagers themselves are\nprotecting habitats and explicitly rejecting\ngovernment involvement. The inhabitants of\nfive villages in the Alwar district of Rajasthan\nwy have declared 1,200 hectares of forest as the\nyw Bhairodev Dakav ‘Sonchuri’, declaring their\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nown set of rules and regulations which do not\nallow hunting, and are protecting the wildlife\nagainst any outside encroachments.\n\nThe famous Chipko movement in the\nHimalayas has not only successfully resisted\ndeforestation in several areas but has also\nshown that community afforestation with\nindigenous species can be enormously\nsuccessful. Attempts to revive the traditional\nconservation methods or developing new\nmethods of ecological farming are now\nwidespread. Farmers and citizen’s groups like\nthe Beej Bachao Andolan in Tehri and\nNavdanya have shown that adequate levels of\ndiversified crop production without the use of\nsynthetic chemicals are possible and\neconomically viable.\n\nIn India joint forest management (JFM)\nprogramme furnishes a good example for\ninvolving local communities in the\nmanagement and restoration of degraded\n\n\n\n®\nSacred groves - a wealth of diverse and rare\n\nspecies\n\nNature worship is an age old tribal belief based on\nthe premise that all creations of nature have to be\nprotected. Such beliefs have preserved several virgin\nforests in pristine form called Sacred Groves (the\nforests of God and Goddesses). These patches of\nforest or parts of large forests have been left\nuntouched by the local people and any interference\nwith them is banned.\n\nCertain societies revere a particular tree which\nthey have preserved from time immemorial. The\nMundas and the Santhal of Chota Nagpur region\nworship mahua (Bassia latifolia) and kadamba\n(Anthocaphalus cadamba) trees, and the tribals of\nOdisha and Bihar worship the tamarind (Tamarindus\nindica) and mango (Mangijfera indica) trees during\nweddings. To many of us, peepal and banyan trees\nare considered sacred.\n\nIndian society comprises several cultures, each\nwith its own set of traditional methods of conserving\nnature and its creations. Sacred qualities are often\nascribed to springs, mountain peaks, plants and\nanimals which are closely protected. You will find\ntroops of macaques and langurs around many\ntemples. They are fed daily and treated as a part of\ntemple devotees.

The programme has been in formal\nexistence since 1988 when the state of\nOdisha passed the first resolution for joint\nforest management.

In return, the members of\nthese communities are entitled to\nintermediary benefits like non-timber\nforest produces and share in the timber\nharvested by ‘successful protection’.\n\nThe clear lesson from the dynamics of\nboth environmental destruction and\nreconstruction in India is that local\ncommunities everywhere have to be\ninvolved in some kind of natural resource\nmanagement. But there is still a long way\nto go before local communities are at the\ncentre-stage in decision-making.

What\n\nYou already know that three-fourth of the\nearth’s surface is covered with water, but only\na small proportion of it accounts for\nfreshwater that can be put to use. This\nfreshwater is mainly obtained from surface\nrun off and ground water that is continually\nbeing renewed and recharged through the\nhydrological cycle. All water moves within the\nhydrological cycle ensuring that water is a\nrenewable resource.\n\nYou might wonder that if three-fourth of\nthe world is covered with water and water is\na renewable resource, then how is it that\ncountries and regions around the globe suffer\nfrom water scarcity? Why is it predicted that\nby 2025, nearly two billion people will live in\nabsolute water scarcity?\n\nhavoc they have created it has destroyed and\nswept away everything in its path.\n\nYes, Chintu, I did. Isn't it strange that\nwater can give life and take life as well.\nWhat would we do without water?\n\nWe need water to drink, cook our\nfood, wash our clothes and wash\nourselves as well. My father was\ntelling me that in his factory they\nneed a lot of water for a number of\nthings. Did you know that they even\nneed water for cooling the machines?\nIn fact, the factory runs on the power supplied by the\nhydel power plant. Now, I can understand why\nthrough the ages we humans have chosen to live\n\nnear water courses along the rivers and other water\nsources like springs, lakes, ponds and oases.\n\nWATER SCARCITY AND THE NEED FOR WATER\nCONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT\n\nGiven the abundance and renewability of\nwater, it is difficult to imagine that we may\nsuffer from water scarcity. The moment we\nspeak of water shortages, we immediately\nassociate it with regions having low rainfall\nor those that are drought prone. We\ninstantaneously visualise the deserts of\nRajasthan and women balancing many\n‘matkas’ (earthen pots) used for collecting\nand storing water and travelling long\ndistances to get water. True, the availability\nof water resources varies over space and time,\nmainly due to the variations in seasonal and\nannual precipitation, but water scarcity in\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nmost cases is caused by over-exploitation,\nexcessive use and unequal access to water\namong different social groups.\n\nWhere is then water scarcity likely to\noccur? As you have read in the hydrological\ncycle, freshwater can be obtained directly\nfrom precipitation, surface run off and\ngroundwater.\n\nIs it possible that an area or region may\nhave ample water resources but is still facing\nwater scarcity? Many of our cities are such\nexamples. Thus, water scarcity may be an\noutcome of large and growing population and\n\nconsequent greater demands for water, and\nunequal access to it. A large population\nrequires more water not only for domestic\nuse but also to produce more food. Hence, to\nfacilitate higher food-grain production, water\nresources are being over-exploited to expand\nirrigated areas for dry-season agriculture.\nIrrigated agriculture is the largest consumer\nof water. Now it is needed to revolutionise the\nagriculture through developing drought\nresistant crops and dry farming techniques.\nYou may have seen in many television\nadvertisements that most farmers have their\n\nUe sit Sasa WA 25 Veh. sitaa artis aat are eer AW ae ar ats\nare Tet F at Ga site 114 Set, sitea anfttee aut are eat Sor\nufa aed fenet srr Y qar saya User Fi Ser A ser at Sacrerar siz\nWAR ST H arya BAfad Hears + BA a aA Ht aat sr se\nadl-arelt & asit @ agent ay F aen are & rae sat SH are\nerrern At Tet aor HH fore Ure ant apett SH era Fi A et yer areor Fer\n\nWater, Water Everywhere, Not a Drop to Drink:\nAfter a heavy downpour, a boy collects drinking\nwater in Kolkata.

But have\nyou ever wondered what this could result in?\nThat it may lead to falling groundwater levels,\nadversely affecting water availability and food\nsecurity of the people.\n\nPost-independent India witnessed\nintensive industrialisation and urbanisation,\ncreating vast opportunities for us. Today, large\nindustrial houses are as commonplace as the\nindustrial units of many MNCs (Multinational\nCorporations). The ever-increasing number of\nindustries has made matters worse by exerting\npressure on existing freshwater resources.\nIndustries, apart from being heavy users of\nwater, also require power to run them. Much\nof this energy comes from hydroelectric power.\nMoreover, multiplying urban centres with\nlarge and dense populations and urban\nlifestyles have not only added to water and\nenergy requirements but have further\naggravated the problem. If you look into the\nhousing societies or colonies in the cities, you\nwould find that most of these have their own\ngroundwater pumping devices to meet their\nwater needs. Not surprisingly, we find that\nfragile water resources are being over-\nexploited and have caused their depletion in\nseveral of these cities.\n\nDo you know?\n\nAtal Bhujal Yojana (Atal Jal) is being\nimplemented in 8220 water stressed Gram\nPanchayats of 229 administrative blocks /\ntalukas in 80 districts of seven states, viz.\nGujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya\nPradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and\nUttar Pradesh. The selected States account\nfor about 37 per cent of the total number\nof water— stressed (over-exploited, critical\nand semi-critical) blocks in India. One of\nthe key aspects of Atal Jal is to bring in\nbehavioural changes in the community,\nfrom the prevailing attitude of\nconsumption to conservation and smart\nwater management.\n\nSource: Annual Report, Ministry of Jal Shakti,\nGovernment of India 2022-23\n\nSo far we have focused on the quantitative\naspects of water scarcity. Now, let us consider\nanother situation where water is sufficiently\n\navailable to meet the needs of the people, but,\nthe area still suffers from water scarcity. This\nscarcity may be due to bad quality of water.\nLately, there has been a growing concern that\neven if there is ample water to meet the needs\nof the people, much of it may be polluted by\ndomestic and industrial wastes, chemicals,\npesticides and fertilisers used in agriculture,\nthus, making it hazardous for human use.\nGovernment of India has accorded highest\npriority to improve the quality of life and\nenhance ease of living of people especially those\nliving in rual areas by announcing the Jal\nJeevan Mission (JJM). The Goal of JJM is to\nenable every rural household get assured\nsupply of potable piped water at a service level\nof 55 litres per capita per day regularly on\nlong-term basis by ensuring functionality of\nthe tap water connections. (Source: Economic\nSurvey 2020-21, p.357)\n\nYou may have already realised that the need\nof the hour is to conserve and manage our\nwater resources, to safeguard ourselves from\nhealth hazards, to ensure food security,\ncontinuation of our livelihoods and productive\nactivities and also to prevent degradation of our\nnatural ecosystems. Over exploitation and\nmismanagement of water resources will\nimpoverish this resource and cause ecological\ncrisis that may have profound impact on\nour lives.\n\nActivity\nFrom your everyday experiences, write a short\nproposal on how you can conserve water.\n\nMULTI-PURPOSE RIVER PROJECTS AND\nINTEGRATED WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT\n\nBut, how do we conserve and manage water?\nArchaeological and historical records show\nthat from ancient times we have been\nconstructing sophisticated hydraulic\nstructures like dams built of stone rubble,\nreservoirs or lakes, embankments and canals\nfor irrigation.

Dams also fragment rivers making it\ndifficult for aquatic fauna to migrate, especially\nfor spawning. The reservoirs that are created\non the floodplains also submerge the existing\nvegetation and soil leading to its\ndecomposition over a period of time.\n\nDo you know?\n\nSardar Sarovar Dam has been built over\nthe Narmada River in Gujarat.

In\nancient India, along with the sophisticated\nhydraulic structures, there existed an\nextraordinary tradition of water-harvesting\nsystem. People had in-depth knowledge of\nrainfall regimes and soil types and developed\nwide ranging techniques to harvest\nrainwater, groundwater, river water and flood\nwater in keeping with the local ecological\nconditions and their water needs. In hill and\nmountainous regions, people built diversion\nchannels like the ‘guls’ or ‘kuls’ of the\nWestern Himalayas for agriculture. ‘Rooftop\nrainwater harvesting’ was commonly\n\nBasic Safety Precautions To Be Taken :\n\npractised to store drinking water,\nparticularly in Rajasthan. In the flood plains\nof Bengal, people developed inundation\nchannels to irrigate their fields. In arid and\nsemi-arid regions, agricultural fields were\nconverted into rain fed storage structures\nthat allowed the water to stand and moisten\nthe soil like the ‘khadins’ in Jaisalmer and\n‘JJohads’ in other parts of Rajasthan.\n\nIn the semi-arid and arid regions of\nRajasthan, particularly in Bikaner, Phalodi\nand Barmer, almost all the houses\ntraditionally had underground tanks or\ntankas for storing drinking water. The tanks\ncould be as large as a big room; one\nhousehold in Phalodi had a tank that was\n6.1 metres deep, 4.27 metres long and 2.44\nmetres wide.

It is interesting because\nCherapunjee and Mawsynram situated\nat a distance of 55 km. from Shillong\nreceive the highest rainfall in the world,\nyet the state capital Shillong faces acute\nshortage of water. Nearly every\nhousehold in the city has a rooftop\nrainwater harvesting structure. Nearly\n15-25 per cent of the total water\nrequirement of the household comes\nfrom rooftop water harvesting.\n\nActivity\nFind out other rainwater harvesting systems\nexisting in and around your locality.\n\nroom cool.\n\nToday, in western Rajasthan, sadly the\npractice of rooftop rainwater harvesting is on\nthe decline as plenty of water is available due\nto the perennial Indira Gandhi Canal, though\nsome houses still maintain the tankas since\nthey do not like the taste of tap water.\nFortunately, in many parts of rural and urban\nIndia, rooftop rainwater harvesting is being\nsuccessfully adapted to store and conserve\nwater. In Gendathur, a remote backward\nvillage in Mysuru, Karnataka, villagers have\ninstalled, in their household’s rooftop,\nrainwater harvesting system to meet their\nwater needs. Nearly 200 households have\ninstalled this system and the village has earned\nthe rare distinction of being rich in rainwater.\nSee Fig. 3.6 for a better understanding of the\nrooftop rainwater harvesting system which is\n\nadapted here. Gendathur receives an annual\nprecipitation of 1,000 mm, and with 80 per\ncent of collection efficiency and of about 10\nfillings, every house can collect and use about\n50,000 litres of water annually. From the 200\nhouses, the net amount of rainwater harvested\nannually amounts to 1,00,000 litres.\n\nRooftop harvesting was common across the towns\nand villages of the Thar. Rainwater that falls on\nthe sloping roofs of houses is taken through a\npipe into an underground tanka (circular holes in\nthe ground). built in the main house or in the\ncourtyard. The picture above shows water being\n\ntaken from a neighbour’s roof through a long pipe.\n\nHere the neighbour’s rooftop has been used for\ncollection of rainwater. The picture shows a hole\nthrough which rainwater flows down into an\nunderground tanka.\n\nFig. 3.6\n\n@\n\nInteresting Fact\n\nTamil Nadu is the first state in India\nwhich has made rooftop rainwater\nharvesting structure compulsory to all\nthe houses across the state.

In Gendathur, a remote backward\nvillage in Mysuru, Karnataka, villagers have\ninstalled, in their household’s rooftop,\nrainwater harvesting system to meet their\nwater needs. Nearly 200 households have\ninstalled this system and the village has earned\nthe rare distinction of being rich in rainwater.\nSee Fig. 3.6 for a better understanding of the\nrooftop rainwater harvesting system which is\n\nadapted here.

From the 200\nhouses, the net amount of rainwater harvested\nannually amounts to 1,00,000 litres.\n\nRooftop harvesting was common across the towns\nand villages of the Thar. Rainwater that falls on\nthe sloping roofs of houses is taken through a\npipe into an underground tanka (circular holes in\nthe ground). built in the main house or in the\ncourtyard.

Over these years, cultivation\nmethods have changed significantly depending\nupon the characteristics of physical\nenvironment, technological know-how and\nsocio-cultural practices. Farming varies from\nsubsistence to commercial type. At present,\nin different parts of India, the following\nfarming systems are practised.\n\nPrimitive Subsistence Farming\n\nThis type of farming is still practised in few\npockets of India. Primitive subsistence\nagriculture is practised on small patches of\nland with the help of primitive tools like hoe,\ndao and digging sticks, and family/\ncommunity labour. This type of farming\ndepends upon monsoon, natural fertility of\nthe soil and suitability of other environmental\nconditions to the crops grown.\n\nIt is a ‘slash and burn’ agriculture.\nFarmers clear a patch of land and produce\ncereals and other food crops to sustain their\nfamily. When the soil fertility decreases, the\nfarmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land\nfor cultivation. This type of shifting allows\nNature to replenish the fertility of the soil\n\nthrough natural processes; land productivity\nin this type of agriculture is low as the farmer\ndoes not use fertilisers or other modern\n\ninputs. It is known by different names in\ndifferent parts of the country.\n\nCan you name some such types of farmings?\n\nIt is jhumming in north-eastern states like\nAssam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland;\nPamlou in Manipur, Dipa in Bastar district\nof Chhattishgarh, and in Andaman and\n\nNicobar Islands.\n8\n\nJhumming: The ‘slash and burn’ agriculture\nis known as ‘Milpa’ in Mexico and Central\nAmerica, ‘Conuco’ in Venzuela, ‘Roca’ in\nBrazil, ‘Masole’ in Central Africa, ‘Ladang’\nin Indonesia, ‘Ray’ in Vietnam.\n\nIn India, this primitive form of cultivation\nis called ‘Bewar’ or ‘Dahiya’ in Madhya\nPradesh, ‘Podu’ or ‘Penda’ in Andhra Pradesh,\n‘Pama Dabi’ or ‘Koman’ or Bringa’ in Odisha,\n‘Kumari’ in Western Ghats, ‘Valre’ or ‘Waltre’\nin South-eastern Rajasthan, ‘Khil’ in the\nHimalayan belt, ‘Kuruwa’ in Jharkhand, and\nJhumming’ in the North-eastern region.\n\naa\npies &\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\ne—,\nRinjha lived with her family in a small village\n\nat the outskirts of Diphu in Assam. She enjoys \\\nwatching her family members clearing, ~\nslashing and burning a patch of land for\ncultivation. She often helps them in irrigating\nthe fields with water running through a\nbamboo canal from the nearby spring. She\nloves the surroundings and wants to stay\nhere as long as she can, but this little girl\ne has no idea about the declining fertility of\n© the soil and her family’s search for fresh a\ny patch of land in the next season.\n\nCan you name the type of farming Rinjha’s\nfamily is engaged in?\n\nCan you enlist some crops which are grown\nin such farming?\n\nIntensive Subsistence Farming\n\nThis type of farming is practised in areas of\nhigh population pressure on land. It is labour-\nintensive farming, where high doses of\nbiochemical inputs and irrigation are used\nfor obtaining higher production.\n\nCan you name some of the states of India\nwhere such farming is practised?\n\nThough the ‘right of inheritance’ leading\nto the division of land among successive\ngenerations has rendered land-holding size\nuneconomical, the farmers continue to take\nmaximum output from the limited land in\nthe absence of alternative source of livelihood.\nThus, there is enormous pressure on\nagricultural land.\n\nCommercial Farming\n\nThe main characteristic of this type of farming\nis the use of higher doses of modern inputs,\ne.g. high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, chemical\nfertilisers, insecticides and pesticides in order\nto obtain higher productivity. The degree of\ncommercialisation of agriculture varies from\none region to another. For example, rice is a\ncommercial crop in Haryana and Punjab, but\nin Odisha, it is a subsistence crop.\n\nCan you give some more examples of crops\nwhich may be commercial in one region and\nmay provide subsistence in another region?\n\nPlantation is also a type of commercial\nfarming. In this type of farming, a single crop\nis grown on a large area. The plantation has\nan interface of agriculture and industry.\nPlantations cover large tracts of land, using\ncapital intensive inputs, with the help of\nmigrant labourers. All the produce is used\nas raw material in respective industries.\n\nIn India, tea, coffee, rubber, sugarcane,\nbanana, etc., are important plantation crops.\nTea in Assam and North Bengal coffee in\nKarnataka are some of the important\nplantation crops grown in these states. Since\nthe production is mainly for market, a well-\ndeveloped network of transport and\ncommunication connecting the plantation\nareas, processing industries and markets\nplays an important role in the development\nof plantations.\n\nReo 5e we pie Pa ks a5 aed\nirae “yee tS oe oe\n\nFig. 4.2: Banana plantation in Southern\npart of India\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nCRopPING PATTERN\n\nYou have studied the physical diversities and\nplurality of cultures in India. These are also\nreflected in agricultural practices and\ncropping patterns in the country. Various\ntypes of food and fibre crops, vegetables and\nfruits, spices and condiments, etc. constitute\nsome of the important crops grown in the\ncountry. India has three cropping seasons\n— rabi, kharif and zaid.\n\nRabi crops are sown in winter from October\nto December and harvested in summer from\nApril to June. Some of the important rabi\ncrops are wheat, barley, peas, gram and\nmustard. Though, these crops are grown in\nlarge parts of India, states from the north\nand north-western parts such as Punjab,\nHaryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and\nKashmir, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are\nimportant for the production of wheat and\nother rabi crops. Availability of precipitation\nduring winter months due to the western\ntemperate cyclones helps in the success of\nthese crops. However, the success of the green\nrevolution in Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar\nPradesh and parts of Rajasthan has also been\nan important factor in the growth of the above-\nmentioned rabi crops.\n\nKharif crops are grown with the onset of\nmonsoon in different parts of the country and\nthese are harvested in September-October.\nImportant crops grown during this season\nare paddy, maize, jowar, bajra, tur (arhar),\nmoong, urad, cotton, jute, groundnut and\nsoyabean. Some of the most important rice-\ngrowing regions are Assam, West Bengal,\ncoastal regions of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh,\nTelangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and\nMaharashtra, particularly the (Konkan coast)\nalong with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Recently,\npaddy has also become an important crop of\nPunjab and Haryana. In states like Assam,\nWest Bengal and Odisha, three crops of paddy\nare grown in a year. These are Aus, Aman\nand Boro.\n\n| In between the rabi and the kharif seasons,\n‘there is a short season during the summer\nmonths known as the Zaid season. Some of\nthe crops produced during ‘zaid’ are\n\nCN CONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nwatermelon, muskmelon, cucumber,\nvegetables and fodder crops. Sugarcane takes\nalmost a year to grow.\n\nMajor Crops\n\nA variety of food and non food crops are\ngrown in different parts of the country\ndepending upon the variations in soil, climate\nand cultivation practices. Major crops grown\nin India are rice, wheat, millets, pulses, tea,\ncoffee, sugarcane, oil seeds, cotton and jute,\netc.\n\nRice: It is the staple food crop of a majority of\nthe people in India. Our country is the second\nlargest producer of rice in the world after\nChina. It is a kharif crop which requires high\ntemperature, (above 25°C) and high humidity\nwith annual rainfall above 100 cm.

It is the main food crop, in north\nand north-western part of the country. This\nrabi crop requires a cool growing season and\na bright sunshine at the time of ripening. It\nrequires 50 to 75 cm of annual rainfall evenly-\ndistributed over the growing season.

Though,\nthese are known as coarse grains, they have\nvery high nutritional value. For example, ragi\nis very rich in iron, calcium, other micro\nnutrients and roughage. Jowar is the third\nmost important food crop with respect to area\nand production. It is a rain-fed crop mostly\ngrown in the moist areas which hardly needs\nlirrigation.

Sustained uses of land\nwithout compatible techno-institutional\nchanges have hindered the pace of agricultural\ndevelopment. Inspite of development of sources\nof irrigation most of the farmers in large parts\nof the country still depend upon monsoon and\nnatural fertility in order to carry on their\nagriculture. For a growing population, this\nposes a serious challenge. Agriculture which\nprovides livelihood for more than 60 per cent of\nits population, needs some serious technical\nand institutional reforms. Thus,\ncollectivisation, consolidation of holdings,\ncooperation and abolition of zamindari, etc.\nwere given priority to bring about institutional\nreforms in the country after Independence.\n‘Land reform’ was the main focus of our First\nFive Year Plan. The right of inheritance had\nalready led to fragmentation of land holdings\nnecessitating consolidation of holdings.\n\nThe laws of land reforms were enacted but\nthe implementation was lacking or lukewarm.\nThe Government of India embarked upon\nintroducing agricultural reforms to improve\nIndian agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe Green Revolution based on the use of\npackage technology and the White Revolution\n(Operation Flood) were some of the strategies\ninitiated to improve the lot of Indian agriculture.\nBut, this too led to the concentration of\ndevelopment in few selected areas.

Besides food grains, it also\nproduces raw material for various industries.\n\nCan you name some industries based on\nagricultural raw material?\n\nMoreover, some agricultural products like tea,\ncoffee, spices, etc. are also exported.\n\nTYPES OF FARMING\n\nAgriculture is an age-old economic activity in\nour country. Over these years, cultivation\nmethods have changed significantly depending\nupon the characteristics of physical\nenvironment, technological know-how and\nsocio-cultural practices. Farming varies from\nsubsistence to commercial type. At present,\nin different parts of India, the following\nfarming systems are practised.\n\nPrimitive Subsistence Farming\n\nThis type of farming is still practised in few\npockets of India. Primitive subsistence\nagriculture is practised on small patches of\nland with the help of primitive tools like hoe,\ndao and digging sticks, and family/\ncommunity labour. This type of farming\ndepends upon monsoon, natural fertility of\nthe soil and suitability of other environmental\nconditions to the crops grown.\n\nIt is a ‘slash and burn’ agriculture.\nFarmers clear a patch of land and produce\ncereals and other food crops to sustain their\nfamily. When the soil fertility decreases, the\nfarmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land\nfor cultivation. This type of shifting allows\nNature to replenish the fertility of the soil\n\nthrough natural processes; land productivity\nin this type of agriculture is low as the farmer\ndoes not use fertilisers or other modern\n\ninputs. It is known by different names in\ndifferent parts of the country.\n\nCan you name some such types of farmings?\n\nIt is jhumming in north-eastern states like\nAssam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland;\nPamlou in Manipur, Dipa in Bastar district\nof Chhattishgarh, and in Andaman and\n\nNicobar Islands.\n8\n\nJhumming: The ‘slash and burn’ agriculture\nis known as ‘Milpa’ in Mexico and Central\nAmerica, ‘Conuco’ in Venzuela, ‘Roca’ in\nBrazil, ‘Masole’ in Central Africa, ‘Ladang’\nin Indonesia, ‘Ray’ in Vietnam.\n\nIn India, this primitive form of cultivation\nis called ‘Bewar’ or ‘Dahiya’ in Madhya\nPradesh, ‘Podu’ or ‘Penda’ in Andhra Pradesh,\n‘Pama Dabi’ or ‘Koman’ or Bringa’ in Odisha,\n‘Kumari’ in Western Ghats, ‘Valre’ or ‘Waltre’\nin South-eastern Rajasthan, ‘Khil’ in the\nHimalayan belt, ‘Kuruwa’ in Jharkhand, and\nJhumming’ in the North-eastern region.\n\naa\npies &\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

She\nloves the surroundings and wants to stay\nhere as long as she can, but this little girl\ne has no idea about the declining fertility of\n© the soil and her family’s search for fresh a\ny patch of land in the next season.\n\nCan you name the type of farming Rinjha’s\nfamily is engaged in?\n\nCan you enlist some crops which are grown\nin such farming?\n\nIntensive Subsistence Farming\n\nThis type of farming is practised in areas of\nhigh population pressure on land. It is labour-\nintensive farming, where high doses of\nbiochemical inputs and irrigation are used\nfor obtaining higher production.\n\nCan you name some of the states of India\nwhere such farming is practised?\n\nThough the ‘right of inheritance’ leading\nto the division of land among successive\ngenerations has rendered land-holding size\nuneconomical, the farmers continue to take\nmaximum output from the limited land in\nthe absence of alternative source of livelihood.\nThus, there is enormous pressure on\nagricultural land.\n\nCommercial Farming\n\nThe main characteristic of this type of farming\nis the use of higher doses of modern inputs,\ne.g. high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, chemical\nfertilisers, insecticides and pesticides in order\nto obtain higher productivity. The degree of\ncommercialisation of agriculture varies from\none region to another. For example, rice is a\ncommercial crop in Haryana and Punjab, but\nin Odisha, it is a subsistence crop.\n\nCan you give some more examples of crops\nwhich may be commercial in one region and\nmay provide subsistence in another region?\n\nPlantation is also a type of commercial\nfarming. In this type of farming, a single crop\nis grown on a large area.

These are also\nreflected in agricultural practices and\ncropping patterns in the country. Various\ntypes of food and fibre crops, vegetables and\nfruits, spices and condiments, etc. constitute\nsome of the important crops grown in the\ncountry. India has three cropping seasons\n— rabi, kharif and zaid.\n\nRabi crops are sown in winter from October\nto December and harvested in summer from\nApril to June. Some of the important rabi\ncrops are wheat, barley, peas, gram and\nmustard. Though, these crops are grown in\nlarge parts of India, states from the north\nand north-western parts such as Punjab,\nHaryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and\nKashmir, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are\nimportant for the production of wheat and\nother rabi crops. Availability of precipitation\nduring winter months due to the western\ntemperate cyclones helps in the success of\nthese crops. However, the success of the green\nrevolution in Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar\nPradesh and parts of Rajasthan has also been\nan important factor in the growth of the above-\nmentioned rabi crops.\n\nKharif crops are grown with the onset of\nmonsoon in different parts of the country and\nthese are harvested in September-October.\nImportant crops grown during this season\nare paddy, maize, jowar, bajra, tur (arhar),\nmoong, urad, cotton, jute, groundnut and\nsoyabean. Some of the most important rice-\ngrowing regions are Assam, West Bengal,\ncoastal regions of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh,\nTelangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and\nMaharashtra, particularly the (Konkan coast)\nalong with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Recently,\npaddy has also become an important crop of\nPunjab and Haryana. In states like Assam,\nWest Bengal and Odisha, three crops of paddy\nare grown in a year. These are Aus, Aman\nand Boro.\n\n| In between the rabi and the kharif seasons,\n‘there is a short season during the summer\nmonths known as the Zaid season. Some of\nthe crops produced during ‘zaid’ are\n\nCN CONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nwatermelon, muskmelon, cucumber,\nvegetables and fodder crops. Sugarcane takes\nalmost a year to grow.\n\nMajor Crops\n\nA variety of food and non food crops are\ngrown in different parts of the country\ndepending upon the variations in soil, climate\nand cultivation practices. Major crops grown\nin India are rice, wheat, millets, pulses, tea,\ncoffee, sugarcane, oil seeds, cotton and jute,\netc.\n\nRice: It is the staple food crop of a majority of\nthe people in India. Our country is the second\nlargest producer of rice in the world after\nChina. It is a kharif crop which requires high\ntemperature, (above 25°C) and high humidity\nwith annual rainfall above 100 cm.

Thus,\ncollectivisation, consolidation of holdings,\ncooperation and abolition of zamindari, etc.\nwere given priority to bring about institutional\nreforms in the country after Independence.\n‘Land reform’ was the main focus of our First\nFive Year Plan. The right of inheritance had\nalready led to fragmentation of land holdings\nnecessitating consolidation of holdings.\n\nThe laws of land reforms were enacted but\nthe implementation was lacking or lukewarm.\nThe Government of India embarked upon\nintroducing agricultural reforms to improve\nIndian agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe Green Revolution based on the use of\npackage technology and the White Revolution\n(Operation Flood) were some of the strategies\ninitiated to improve the lot of Indian agriculture.\nBut, this too led to the concentration of\ndevelopment in few selected areas.

He also sees a “kitchen” dragging a\nnumber of house along with it. He is amazed\nand asked his father “Why don’t our houses\nmove like the one we saw in Guwahati, Ba?”\n\nBa replies, “These are not houses, they\nare buses and trains. Unlike our houses these\nare not made of bricks and stones, metal like\niron and alluminium are used in making\n\n@ these. They do not move on their own. They\nare driven by an engine which needs energy\nto work.”\n\nWe use different things in our daily life made\nfrom metal. Can you list a number of items\nused in your house made of metals. Where do\nthese metals come from?\n\nYou have studied that the earth’s crust is\nmade up of different minerals embedded in the\nrocks. Various metals are extracted from these\nminerals after proper refinement.\n\nMinerals are an indispensable part of our\nlives. Almost everything we use, from a tiny pin\nto a towering building or a big ship, all are\nmade from minerals. The railway lines and the\ntarmac (paving) of the roads, our implements\nand machinery too are made from minerals.\nCars, buses, trains, aeroplanes are\nmanufactured from minerals and run on\npower resources derived from the earth. Even\nthe food that we eat contains minerals. In all\nstages of development, human beings have\nused minerals for their livelihood, decoration,\nfestivities, religious and ceremonial rites.\n\n1068CHOS\n\nand minerals\n\ne\nA bright smile from toothpaste\n\nToothpaste cleans your teeth. Abrasive\nminerals like silica, limestone, aluminium\noxide and various phosphate minerals do the\ncleaning. Fluoride which is used to reduce\ncavities, comes from a mineral fluorite. Most\ntoothpaste are made white with titanium\noxide, which comes from minerals called\nrutile, ilmenite and anatase. The sparkle in\nsome toothpastes comes from mica. The\n®@ toothbrush and tube containing the paste are\n\nmade of plastics from petroleum. Find out\nwhere these minerals are found?\n\nDig a little deeper and find out how many\nminerals are used to make a light bulb?\n\nS\nAll living things need minerals\nLife processes cannot occur without minerals.\nAlthough our mineral intake represents only\nabout 0.3 per cent of our total intake of\n@ nutrients, they are so potent and so important\n\nthat without them we would not be able to\nutilise the other 99.7 per cent of foodstuffs.\n\nDig a little deeper and collect “Nutritional\nFacts” printed on food labels.\n\nWhat is a mineral?\n\nGeologists define mineral as a\n“homogenous, naturally occurring substance\nwith a definable internal structure.” Minerals\nare found in varied forms in nature, ranging\nfrom the hardest diamond to the softest talc.\nWhy are they so varied?\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nYou have already learnt about rocks.\nRocks are combinations of homogenous\nsubstances called minerals. Some rocks, for\ninstance limestone, consist of a single mineral\nonly, but majority of the rock consist of several\nminerals in varying proportions. Although,\nover 2000 minerals have been identified, only\na few are abundantly found in most of the\nrocks.\n\nA particular mineral that will be formed\nfrom a certain combination of elements\ndepends upon the physical and chemical\nconditions under which the material forms.\nThis, in turn, results in a wide range of colours,\nhardness, crystal forms, lustre and density that\na particular mineral possesses. Geologists use\nthese properties to classify the minerals.\n\n@-\nStudy of Minerals by Geographers\nand Geologists\n\nGeographers study minerals as part of the ~\nearth’s crust for a better understanding of\nlandforms. The distribution of mineral\nresources and associated economic activities\nare of interest to geographers. A geologist,\n@ however, is interested in the formation of\n\\. minerals, their age and physical and\nchemical composition.\nHowever, for general and commercial\npurposes minerals can be classified as under.\n\nMopDE oF OCCURRENCE OF MINERALS\n\nWhere are these minerals found?\n\nMinerals are usually found in “ores”. The\nterm ore is used to describe an accumulation\nof any mineral mixed with other elements.\nThe mineral content of the ore must be in\n\nsufficient concentration to make its extraction\ncommercially viable. The type of formation or\nstructure in which they are found determines\nthe relative ease with which mineral ores may\nbe mined. This also determines the cost of\nextraction. It is, therefore, important for us\nto understand the main types of formations\nin which minerals occur.\nMinerals generally occur in these forms:\n\n(i) In igneous and metamorphic rocks\nminerals may occur in the cracks,\ncrevices, faults or joints. The smaller\noccurrences are called veins and the\nlarger are called lodes. In most cases,\nthey are formed when minerals in liquid/\nmolten and gaseous forms are forced\nupward through cavities towards the\nearth’s surface. They cool and solidify as\nthey rise. Major metallic minerals like tin,\ncopper, zinc and lead etc. are obtained\nfrom veins and lodes.\n\n(ii) In sedimentary rocks a number of minerals\noccur in beds or layers. They have been\nformed as a result of deposition,\naccumulation and concentration in\nhorizontal strata. Coal and some forms of\niron ore have been concentrated as a result\nof long periods under great heat and\npressure. Another group of sedimentary\nminerals include gypsum, potash salt and\nsodium salt. These are formed as a result\nof evaporation especially in arid regions.\n\n(iii) Another mode of formation involves the\ndecomposition of surface rocks, and the\nremoval of soluble constituents, leaving\na residual mass of weathered\nmaterial containing ores. Bauxite is\nformed this way.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS\n\nMinerals\n\n' a Te”\n\nMetallic\n\nFerrous (containing Non-Ferrous\niron) e.g. iron ore, e.g. copper, lead,\nManganese, nickel __ tin, bauxite, etc.\ncobalt, etc.\n\nFig. 5.1\n\nPrecious\ne.g. gold, silver,\nplatinum, etc.\n\nNon-Metallic Energy Minerals\n\ne.g. mica, salt, Coal\npotash, sulphur, Petroleum\ngranite, limestone, Natural gas\n\nmarble, sandstone, etc.\n\nMINERALS AND ENERGY RESOURCES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\n(iv) Certain minerals may occur as alluvial\ndeposits in sands of valley floors and the\nbase of hills. These deposits are called\n‘placer deposits’ and generally contain\nminerals, which are not corroded by water.\nGold, silver, tin and platinum are most\nimportant among such minerals.\n\n(v) The ocean waters contain vast quantities\nof minerals, but most of these are too widely\ndiffused to be of economic significance.\nHowever, common salt, magnesium and\nbromine are largely derived from ocean\nwaters. The ocean beds, too, are rich in\n\ng mhganese nodules.\n\nInteresting Fact\n\nRat-Hole Mining. Do you know that most\nof the minerals in India are nationalised\nand their extraction is possible only after\nobtaining due permission from the\ngovernment? But in most of the tribal\nareas of the north-east India, minerals are\nowned by individuals or communities. In\nMeghalaya, there are large deposits of coal,\niron ore, limestone and dolomite etc. Coal\nmining in Jowai and Cherapunjee is done\nby family member in the form of a long\nnarrow tunnel, known as ‘Rat hole’\nmining. The National Green Tribunal has\ndeclared such activities illegal and\nrecommended that these should be\nstopped forthwith.\n\nDig a little deeper: What is the difference\nbetween an open pit mine, a quarry and an\nunderground mine with shafts?\n\nIndia is fortunate to have fairly rich and\nvaried mineral resources. However, these are\nunevenly distributed. Broadly speaking,\npeninsular rocks contain most of the reserves\nof coal, metallic minerals, mica and many other\nnon-metallic minerals. Sedimentary rocks on\nthe western and eastern flanks of the peninsula,\nin Gujarat and Assam have most of the\npetroleum deposits. Rajasthan with the rock\nsystems of the peninsula, has reserves of many\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nnon-ferrous minerals. The vast alluvial plains\nof north India are almost devoid of economic\nminerals. These variations exist largely because\nof the differences in the geological structure,\nprocesses and time involved in the formation\nof minerals.\n\nLet us now study the distribution of a few\nmajor minerals in India. Always remember that\nthe concentration of mineral in the ore, the ease\nof extraction and closeness to the market play\nan important role in affecting the economic\nviability of a reserve. Thus, to meet the demand,\na choice has to be made between a number of\npossible options. When this is done a mineral\n‘deposit’ or ‘reserve’ turns into a mine.\n\nFerrous Minerals\n\nFerrous minerals account for about three-\nfourths of the total value of the production of\nmetallic minerals. They provide a strong base\nfor the development of metallurgical industries.\nIndia exports substantial quantities of ferrous\nminerals after meeting her internal demands.\n\nIron Ore\n\nIron ore is the basic mineral and the backbone\nof industrial development. India is endowed\nwith fairly abundant resources of iron ore. India\nis rich in good quality iron ores. Magnetite is\nthe finest iron ore with a very high content of\niron up to 70 per cent. It has excellent magnetic\nqualities, especially valuable in the electrical\nindustry. Hematite ore is the most important\nindustrial iron ore in terms of the quantity\nused, but has a slightly lower iron content than\nmagnetite. (50-60 per cent). In 2018-19 almost\nentire production of iron ore (97%) accrued\nfrom Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and\nJharkhand. The remaining production (3%)\nwas from other states.\n\nDo you know?\n\nKudre in Kannada means horse.

In the adjoining Singbhum\ndistrict of Jnarkhand haematite iron ore is\nmined in Gua and Noamundi.\n\nDurg-Bastar-Chandrapur belt lies in\nChhattisgarh and Maharashtra. Very high\ngrade hematites are found in the famous\nBailadila range of hills in the Bastar district\nof Chhattisgarh. The range of hills\ncomprise of 14 deposits of super high\ngrade hematite iron ore. It has the best\nphysical properties needed for steel\nmaking. Iron ore from these mines is\nexported to Japan and South Korea via\nVishakhapatnam port.\n\nBallari-Chitradurga-Chikkamagaluru-\nTumakuru belt in Karnataka has large\nreserves of iron ore. The Kudremukh mines\nlocated in the Western Ghats of Karnataka\nare a 100 per cent export unit. Kudremukh\ndeposits are known to be one of the largest\nin the world. The ore is transported as\nslurry through a pipeline to a port near\nMangaluru.\n\nMaharashtra-Goa belt includes the state\nof Goa and Ratnagiri district of\n\nMaharashtra. Though, the ores are not of\nvery high quality, yet they are efficiently\nexploited. Iron ore is exported through\nMarmagao port.\n\nManganese\n\nManganese is mainly used in the\nmanufacturing of steel and ferro-manganese\nalloy. Nearly 10 kg of manganese is required\nto manufacture one tonne of steel. It is also\nused in manufacturing bleaching powder,\ninsecticides and paints.\n\nAndhra Others\nPradesh W%\n10%\n\nKarnataka\n12%\nMadhya\n\nPradesh\n33%\n\nOdisha\n16%\n\nMaharashtra\n27%\n\nFig. 5.3: Production of Manganese showing\nstate-wise share in per cent, 2018-19\n\nDig a little deeper: Superimpose the maps\n\nshowing distribution of iron ore, manganese,\n\ncoal and iron and steel industry.

The total volume of workable\nmineral deposits is an insignificant fraction\ni.e. one per cent of the earth’s crust. We are\nrapidly consuming mineral resources that\n\nconcentrated. The geological processes of\nmineral formation are so slow that the rates\nof replenishment are infinitely small in\ncomparison to the present rates of\nconsumption. Mineral resources are,\ntherefore, finite and non-renewable. Rich\nmineral deposits are our country’s extremely\nvaluable but short-lived possessions.\nContinued extraction of ores leads to\nincreasing costs as mineral extraction comes\n\nfrom greater depths along with decrease @.\n\nin quality.\n\nMINERALS AND ENERGY RESOURCES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nAconcerted effort has to be made in order\nto use our mineral resources in a planned\nand sustainable manner. Improved\ntechnologies need to be constantly evolved to\nallow use of low grade ores at low costs.\nRecycling of metals, using scrap metals and\nother substitutes are steps in conserving our\nmineral resources for the future.\n\nDig a little deeper: Make a list of items where\nsubstitutes are being used instead of minerals.\nWhere are these substitutes obtained from?\n\nEnergy Resources\n\nEnergy is required for all activities. It is needed\nto cook, to provide light and heat, to propel\nvehicles and to drive machinery in industries.\n\nEnergy can be generated from fuel\nminerals like coal, petroleum, natural gas,\nuranium and from electricity. Energy\nresources can be classified as conventional\nand non-conventional sources. Conventional\nsources include: firewood, cattle dung cake,\ncoal, petroleum, natural gas and electricity\n(both hydel and thermal). Non-conventional\nsources include solar, wind, tidal, geothermal,\nbiogas and atomic energy. Firewood and cattle\ndung cake are most common in rural India.\nAccording to one estimate more than 70 per\ncent energy requirement in rural households\nis met by these two ; continuation of these is\nincreasingly becoming difficult due to\ndecreasing forest area. Moreover, using dung\ncake too is being discouraged because it\nconsumes most valuable manure which could\nbe used in agriculture.\n\nConventional Sources of Energy\n\nCoal: In India, coal is the most abundantly\navailable fossil fuel. It provides a substantial\npart of the nation’s energy needs. It is used\nfor power generation, to supply energy to\nindustry as well as for domestic needs. India\nis highly dependent on coal for meeting its\ncommercial energy requirements.\n\nAs you are already aware that coal is\nformed due the compression of plant material\nover millions of years. Coal, therefore, is\nfound in a variety of forms depending on the\ndegrees of compression and the depth and\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig. 5.9 (b): A view from outside of a coal mine\n\ntime of burial.

It provides\nfuel for heat and lighting, lubricants for\nmachinery and raw materials for a number of\nmanufacturing industries. Petroleum refineries\nact as a “nodal industry” for synthetic textile,\nfertiliser and numerous chemical industries.\n\nMost of the petroleum occurrences in India\nare associated with anticlines and fault traps\nin the rock formations of the tertiary age. In\nregions of folding, anticlines or domes, it\noccurs where oil is trapped in the crest of the\nupfold. The oil bearing layer is a porous\nlimestone or sandstone through which oil may\nflow. The oil is prevented from rising or\nsinking by intervening non-porous layers.\n\nPetroleum is also found in fault traps\nbetween porous and non-porous rocks. Gas,\nbeing lighter usually occurs above the oil.\n\nMumbai High, Gujarat and Assam are\n\nmajor petroleum production areas in India.\nFrom the map locate the 3 major off shore\nfields of western India.

Rising prices of oil and gas and their\npotential shortages have raised uncertainties\nabout the security of energy supply in future,\nwhich in turn has serious repercussions on the\ngrowth of the national economy. Moreover,\nincreasing use of fossil fuels also causes\nserious environmental problems. Hence, there\nis a pressing need to use renewable energy\nsources like solar energy, wind, tide, biomass\nand energy from waste material. These are\ncalled non-conventional energy sources.\n\nIndia is blessed with an abundance of\nsunlight, water, wind and biomass. It has the\nlargest programmes for the development of\nthese renewable energy resources.\n\nNuclear or Atomic Energy\n\nIt is obtained by altering the structure of\natoms. When such an alteration is made, much\nenergy is released in the form of heat and this\nis used to generate electric power.

Nagarcoil and\nJaisalmer are well known for effective use of\nwind energy in the country.\n\nFig. 5.11: Wind mills — Nagarcoil\n\nBiogas\n\nShrubs, farm waste, animal and human waste\nare used to produce biogas for domestic\nconsumption in rural areas. Decomposition\nof organic matter yields gas, which has higher\nthermal efficiency in comparison to kerosene,\ndung cake and charcoal. Biogas plants are\nset up at municipal, cooperative and\nindividual levels. The plants using cattle dung\nare known as ‘Gobar gas plants’ in rural India.\nThese provide twin benefits to the farmer in\nthe form of energy and improved quality of\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nmanure. Biogas is by far the most efficient\nuse of cattle dung. It improves the quality of\nmanure and also prevents the loss of trees\nand manure due to burning of fuel wood\nand cow dung cakes.\n\nad, — Ey, “9\n\nFig. 5.12: Biogas Plant\n\nTidal Energy\n\nOceanic tides can be used to generate\nelectricity. Floodgate dams are built across\ninlets. During high tide water flows into the\ninlet and gets trapped when the gate is closed.\nAfter the tide falls outside the flood gate, the\nwater retained by the floodgate flows back to\nthe sea via a pipe that carries it through a\npower -generating turbine.\n\nIn India the Gulf of Khambhat, the Gulf\nof Kuchchh in Gujarat on the western coast\nand Gangetic delta in Sunderban regions of\nWest Bengal provide ideal conditions for\nutilising tidal energy.\n\nGeo Thermal Energy\n\nGeo thermal energy refers to the heat and\nelectricity produced by using the heat from\nthe interior of the Earth. Geothermal energy\nexists because, the Earth grows progressively\nhotter with increasing depth. Where the\n\ngeothermal gradient is high, high temperatures\nare found at shallow depths. Groundwater in\nsuch areas absorbs heat from the rocks and\nbecomes hot. It is so hot that when it rises to\nthe earth’s surface, it turns into steam. This\nsteam is used to drive turbines and generate\nelectricity.\n\nThere are several hundred hot springs in\nIndia, which could be used to generate\nelectricity. Two experimental projects have been\nset up in India to harness geothermal energy.\nOne is located in the Parvati valley near\nManikaran in Himachal Pradesh and the other\nis located in the Puga Valley, Ladakh.\n\nConservation of Energy Resources\n\nEnergy is a basic requirement for economic\ndevelopment. Every sector of the national\neconomy — agriculture, industry, transport,\ncommercial and domestic — needs inputs of\nenergy. The economic development plans\nimplemented since Independence necessarily\nrequired increasing amounts of energy to\nremain operational. As aresult, consumption\nof energy in all forms has been steadily rising\nall over the country.\n\nIn this background, there is an urgent need\nto develop a sustainable path of energy\ndevelopment. Promotion of energy conservation\nand increased use of renewable energy sources\nare the twin planks of sustainable energy.\n\nIndia is presently one of the least energy\nefficient countries in the world. We have to\nadopt a cautious approach for the judicious\nuse of our limited energy resources. For\nexample, as concerned citizens we can do our\nbit by using public transport systems instead\nof individual vehicles; switching off electricity\nwhen not in use, using power-saving devices\nand using non-conventional sources of energy.\nAfter all, “energy saved is energy produced”.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

        "text": "You have already learnt about rocks.\nRocks are combinations of homogenous\nsubstances called minerals. Some rocks, for\ninstance limestone, consist of a single mineral\nonly, but majority of the rock consist of several\nminerals in varying proportions. Although,\nover 2000 minerals have been identified, only\na few are abundantly found in most of the\nrocks.\n\nA particular mineral that will be formed\nfrom a certain combination of elements\ndepends upon the physical and chemical\nconditions under which the material forms.\nThis, in turn, results in a wide range of colours,\nhardness, crystal forms, lustre and density that\na particular mineral possesses. Geologists use\nthese properties to classify the minerals.\n\n@-\nStudy of Minerals by Geographers\nand Geologists\n\nGeographers study minerals as part of the ~\nearth’s crust for a better understanding of\nlandforms. The distribution of mineral\nresources and associated economic activities\nare of interest to geographers. A geologist,\n@ however, is interested in the formation of\n\\. minerals, their age and physical and\nchemical composition.\nHowever, for general and commercial\npurposes minerals can be classified as under.\n\nMopDE oF OCCURRENCE OF MINERALS\n\nWhere are these minerals found?\n\nMinerals are usually found in “ores”. The\nterm ore is used to describe an accumulation\nof any mineral mixed with other elements.\nThe mineral content of the ore must be in\n\nsufficient concentration to make its extraction\ncommercially viable. The type of formation or\nstructure in which they are found determines\nthe relative ease with which mineral ores may\nbe mined. This also determines the cost of\nextraction. It is, therefore, important for us\nto understand the main types of formations\nin which minerals occur.\nMinerals generally occur in these forms:\n\n(i) In igneous and metamorphic rocks\nminerals may occur in the cracks,\ncrevices, faults or joints. The smaller\noccurrences are called veins and the\nlarger are called lodes. In most cases,\nthey are formed when minerals in liquid/\nmolten and gaseous forms are forced\nupward through cavities towards the\nearth’s surface. They cool and solidify as\nthey rise. Major metallic minerals like tin,\ncopper, zinc and lead etc. are obtained\nfrom veins and lodes.\n\n(ii) In sedimentary rocks a number of minerals\noccur in beds or layers. They have been\nformed as a result of deposition,\naccumulation and concentration in\nhorizontal strata. Coal and some forms of\niron ore have been concentrated as a result\nof long periods under great heat and\npressure. Another group of sedimentary\nminerals include gypsum, potash salt and\nsodium salt. These are formed as a result\nof evaporation especially in arid regions.\n\n(iii) Another mode of formation involves the\ndecomposition of surface rocks, and the\nremoval of soluble constituents, leaving\na residual mass of weathered\nmaterial containing ores. Bauxite is\nformed this way.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS\n\nMinerals\n\n' a Te”\n\nMetallic\n\nFerrous (containing Non-Ferrous\niron) e.g. iron ore, e.g. copper, lead,\nManganese, nickel __ tin, bauxite, etc.\ncobalt, etc.\n\nFig. 5.1\n\nPrecious\ne.g. gold, silver,\nplatinum, etc.\n\nNon-Metallic Energy Minerals\n\ne.g. mica, salt, Coal\npotash, sulphur, Petroleum\ngranite, limestone, Natural gas\n\nmarble, sandstone, etc.\n\nMINERALS AND ENERGY RESOURCES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

        "text": "(iv) Certain minerals may occur as alluvial\ndeposits in sands of valley floors and the\nbase of hills. These deposits are called\n‘placer deposits’ and generally contain\nminerals, which are not corroded by water.\nGold, silver, tin and platinum are most\nimportant among such minerals.\n\n(v) The ocean waters contain vast quantities\nof minerals, but most of these are too widely\ndiffused to be of economic significance.\nHowever, common salt, magnesium and\nbromine are largely derived from ocean\nwaters. The ocean beds, too, are rich in\n\ng mhganese nodules.\n\nInteresting Fact\n\nRat-Hole Mining. Do you know that most\nof the minerals in India are nationalised\nand their extraction is possible only after\nobtaining due permission from the\ngovernment? But in most of the tribal\nareas of the north-east India, minerals are\nowned by individuals or communities. In\nMeghalaya, there are large deposits of coal,\niron ore, limestone and dolomite etc. Coal\nmining in Jowai and Cherapunjee is done\nby family member in the form of a long\nnarrow tunnel, known as ‘Rat hole’\nmining. The National Green Tribunal has\ndeclared such activities illegal and\nrecommended that these should be\nstopped forthwith.\n\nDig a little deeper: What is the difference\nbetween an open pit mine, a quarry and an\nunderground mine with shafts?\n\nIndia is fortunate to have fairly rich and\nvaried mineral resources. However, these are\nunevenly distributed. Broadly speaking,\npeninsular rocks contain most of the reserves\nof coal, metallic minerals, mica and many other\nnon-metallic minerals. Sedimentary rocks on\nthe western and eastern flanks of the peninsula,\nin Gujarat and Assam have most of the\npetroleum deposits. Rajasthan with the rock\nsystems of the peninsula, has reserves of many\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nnon-ferrous minerals. The vast alluvial plains\nof north India are almost devoid of economic\nminerals. These variations exist largely because\nof the differences in the geological structure,\nprocesses and time involved in the formation\nof minerals.\n\nLet us now study the distribution of a few\nmajor minerals in India. Always remember that\nthe concentration of mineral in the ore, the ease\nof extraction and closeness to the market play\nan important role in affecting the economic\nviability of a reserve. Thus, to meet the demand,\na choice has to be made between a number of\npossible options. When this is done a mineral\n‘deposit’ or ‘reserve’ turns into a mine.\n\nFerrous Minerals\n\nFerrous minerals account for about three-\nfourths of the total value of the production of\nmetallic minerals. They provide a strong base\nfor the development of metallurgical industries.\nIndia exports substantial quantities of ferrous\nminerals after meeting her internal demands.\n\nIron Ore\n\nIron ore is the basic mineral and the backbone\nof industrial development. India is endowed\nwith fairly abundant resources of iron ore. India\nis rich in good quality iron ores. Magnetite is\nthe finest iron ore with a very high content of\niron up to 70 per cent. It has excellent magnetic\nqualities, especially valuable in the electrical\nindustry. Hematite ore is the most important\nindustrial iron ore in terms of the quantity\nused, but has a slightly lower iron content than\nmagnetite. (50-60 per cent). In 2018-19 almost\nentire production of iron ore (97%) accrued\nfrom Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and\nJharkhand. The remaining production (3%)\nwas from other states.\n\nDo you know?\n\nKudre in Kannada means horse. The\nhighest peak in the western ghats of\nKarnataka resembles the face of a horse.\nThe Bailadila hills look like the hump of\nan ox, and hence its name.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

The total volume of workable\nmineral deposits is an insignificant fraction\ni.e. one per cent of the earth’s crust. We are\nrapidly consuming mineral resources that\n\nconcentrated. The geological processes of\nmineral formation are so slow that the rates\nof replenishment are infinitely small in\ncomparison to the present rates of\nconsumption. Mineral resources are,\ntherefore, finite and non-renewable. Rich\nmineral deposits are our country’s extremely\nvaluable but short-lived possessions.\nContinued extraction of ores leads to\nincreasing costs as mineral extraction comes\n\nfrom greater depths along with decrease @.\n\nin quality.\n\nMINERALS AND ENERGY RESOURCES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

It is needed\nto cook, to provide light and heat, to propel\nvehicles and to drive machinery in industries.\n\nEnergy can be generated from fuel\nminerals like coal, petroleum, natural gas,\nuranium and from electricity. Energy\nresources can be classified as conventional\nand non-conventional sources. Conventional\nsources include: firewood, cattle dung cake,\ncoal, petroleum, natural gas and electricity\n(both hydel and thermal). Non-conventional\nsources include solar, wind, tidal, geothermal,\nbiogas and atomic energy. Firewood and cattle\ndung cake are most common in rural India.\nAccording to one estimate more than 70 per\ncent energy requirement in rural households\nis met by these two ; continuation of these is\nincreasingly becoming difficult due to\ndecreasing forest area. Moreover, using dung\ncake too is being discouraged because it\nconsumes most valuable manure which could\nbe used in agriculture.\n\nConventional Sources of Energy\n\nCoal: In India, coal is the most abundantly\navailable fossil fuel. It provides a substantial\npart of the nation’s energy needs. It is used\nfor power generation, to supply energy to\nindustry as well as for domestic needs. India\nis highly dependent on coal for meeting its\ncommercial energy requirements.\n\nAs you are already aware that coal is\nformed due the compression of plant material\nover millions of years. Coal, therefore, is\nfound in a variety of forms depending on the\ndegrees of compression and the depth and\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig. 5.9 (b): A view from outside of a coal mine\n\ntime of burial.

It is the most popular coal\nin commercial use. Metallurgical coal is high\ngrade bituminous coal which has a special\nvalue for smelting iron in blast furnaces.\nAnthracite is the highest quality hard coal.\n\nIn India coal occurs in rock series of two\nmain geological ages, namely Gondwana, a\nlittle over 200 million years in age and in\ntertiary deposits which are only about 55\nmillion years old.

The Godavari,\nMahanadi, Son and Wardha valleys also\ncontain coal deposits.\n\nTertiary coals occur in the north eastern\nstates of Meghalaya, Assam, Arunachal\nPradesh and Nagaland.\n\nRemember coal is a bulky material, which\nloses weight on use as it is reduced to ash.\nHence, heavy industries and thermal power\nstations are located on or near the coalfields.\n\nPetroleum\n\nPetroleum or mineral oil is the next major\nenergy source in India after coal. It provides\nfuel for heat and lighting, lubricants for\nmachinery and raw materials for a number of\nmanufacturing industries. Petroleum refineries\nact as a “nodal industry” for synthetic textile,\nfertiliser and numerous chemical industries.\n\nMost of the petroleum occurrences in India\nare associated with anticlines and fault traps\nin the rock formations of the tertiary age. In\nregions of folding, anticlines or domes, it\noccurs where oil is trapped in the crest of the\nupfold. The oil bearing layer is a porous\nlimestone or sandstone through which oil may\nflow. The oil is prevented from rising or\nsinking by intervening non-porous layers.\n\nPetroleum is also found in fault traps\nbetween porous and non-porous rocks.

Digboi,\nNaharkatiya and Moran-Hugrijan are the\nimportant oil fields in the state.\n\nNatural Gas\n\nNatural Gas is found with petroleum deposits\nand is released when crude oil is brought to\nthe surface. It can be used as a domestic and\nindustrial fuel. It is used as fuel in power sector\nto generate electricity, for heating purpose in\nindustries, as raw material in chemical,\npetrochemical and fertilizer industries, as\ntransport fuel and as cooking fuel.

Show\nthem on the map of India.\n\nNon-Conventional Sources of Energy\n\nThe growing consumption of energy has\nresulted in the country becoming increasingly\ndependent on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and\ngas. Rising prices of oil and gas and their\npotential shortages have raised uncertainties\nabout the security of energy supply in future,\nwhich in turn has serious repercussions on the\ngrowth of the national economy. Moreover,\nincreasing use of fossil fuels also causes\nserious environmental problems. Hence, there\nis a pressing need to use renewable energy\nsources like solar energy, wind, tide, biomass\nand energy from waste material. These are\ncalled non-conventional energy sources.\n\nIndia is blessed with an abundance of\nsunlight, water, wind and biomass. It has the\nlargest programmes for the development of\nthese renewable energy resources.\n\nNuclear or Atomic Energy\n\nIt is obtained by altering the structure of\natoms. When such an alteration is made, much\nenergy is released in the form of heat and this\nis used to generate electric power. Uranium and\nThorium, which are available in Jharkhand and\nthe Aravalli ranges of Rajasthan are used for\ngenerating atomic or nuclear power. The\nMonazite sands of Kerala is also rich in\nThorium.\n\nLocate the 6 nuclear power stations and find\nout the state in which they are located.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nIndia is a tropical country. It has enormous\npossibilities of tapping solar energy.\nPhotovoltaic technology converts sunlight\ndirectly into electricity. Solar energy is fast\nbecoming popular in rural and remote areas.\nSome big solar power plants are being\nestablished in different parts of India which\nwill minimise the dependence of rural\nhouseholds on firewood and dung cakes,\nwhich in turn will contribute to environmental\nconservation and adequate supply of manure\nin agriculture.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig. 5.10: Solar operated electronic milk\ntesting equipment\n\nActivity\n\nCollect information about newly established\n\nsolar power plants in India.\n\nWind power\n\nIndia has great potential of wind power. The\nlargest wind farm cluster is located in Tamil\nNadu from Nagarcoil to Madurai. Apart from\nthese, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat,\nKerala, Maharashtra and Lakshadweep have\nimportant wind farms.

Floodgate dams are built across\ninlets. During high tide water flows into the\ninlet and gets trapped when the gate is closed.\nAfter the tide falls outside the flood gate, the\nwater retained by the floodgate flows back to\nthe sea via a pipe that carries it through a\npower -generating turbine.\n\nIn India the Gulf of Khambhat, the Gulf\nof Kuchchh in Gujarat on the western coast\nand Gangetic delta in Sunderban regions of\nWest Bengal provide ideal conditions for\nutilising tidal energy.\n\nGeo Thermal Energy\n\nGeo thermal energy refers to the heat and\nelectricity produced by using the heat from\nthe interior of the Earth. Geothermal energy\nexists because, the Earth grows progressively\nhotter with increasing depth. Where the\n\ngeothermal gradient is high, high temperatures\nare found at shallow depths. Groundwater in\nsuch areas absorbs heat from the rocks and\nbecomes hot. It is so hot that when it rises to\nthe earth’s surface, it turns into steam. This\nsteam is used to drive turbines and generate\nelectricity.\n\nThere are several hundred hot springs in\nIndia, which could be used to generate\nelectricity. Two experimental projects have been\nset up in India to harness geothermal energy.\nOne is located in the Parvati valley near\nManikaran in Himachal Pradesh and the other\nis located in the Puga Valley, Ladakh.\n\nConservation of Energy Resources\n\nEnergy is a basic requirement for economic\ndevelopment. Every sector of the national\neconomy — agriculture, industry, transport,\ncommercial and domestic — needs inputs of\nenergy. The economic development plans\nimplemented since Independence necessarily\nrequired increasing amounts of energy to\nremain operational. As aresult, consumption\nof energy in all forms has been steadily rising\nall over the country.\n\nIn this background, there is an urgent need\nto develop a sustainable path of energy\ndevelopment. Promotion of energy conservation\nand increased use of renewable energy sources\nare the twin planks of sustainable energy.\n\nIndia is presently one of the least energy\nefficient countries in the world. We have to\nadopt a cautious approach for the judicious\nuse of our limited energy resources. For\nexample, as concerned citizens we can do our\nbit by using public transport systems instead\nof individual vehicles; switching off electricity\nwhen not in use, using power-saving devices\nand using non-conventional sources of energy.\nAfter all, “energy saved is energy produced”.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

His mother ~\npurchased utensils, sugar, tea and diyas\n(earthen lamps). Harish observed that the\nshops in the market were flooded with\nitems for sale. He wondered how so many\nitems could be made in such large\nquantities. His father explained that shoes,\nclothes, sugar etc. are manufactured by\nmachines in large industries, some utensils\nare manufactured in small industries, while\nitems like diyas are made by individual\nartisans in household industry.\n\nDo you have some ideas about these\nindustries?\n\nProduction of goods in large quantities after\nprocessing from raw materials to more\nvaluable products is called manufacturing. Do\nyou know that paper is manufactured from\nwood, sugar from sugarcane, iron and steel\nfrom iron ore and aluminium from bauxite?\nDo you also know that some types of clothes\nare manufactured from yarn which itself is an\nindustrial product?\n\nPeople employed in the secondary activities\nmanufacture the primary materials into\nfinished goods. The workers employed in steel\nfactories, car, breweries, textile industries,\nbakeries etc. fall into this category. Some people\nare employed in providing services. In this\nchapter, we are mainly concerned with\nmanufacturing industries which fall in the\nsecondary sector.\n\nThe economic strength of a country is\nmeasured by the development of\nmanufacturing industries.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF MANUFACTURING\n\nManufacturing sector is considered the backbone\nof development in general and economic\ndevelopment in particular mainly because-\n\ne Manufacturing industries not only help in\nmodernising agriculture, which forms the\nbackbone of our economy, they also reduce\nthe heavy dependence of people on\nagricultural income by providing them jobs\nin secondary and tertiary sectors.\n\n¢ Industrial development is a precondition for\neradication of unemployment and poverty\nfrom our country. This was the main\nphilosophy behind public sector industries\nand joint sector ventures in India. It was also\naimed at bringing down regional disparities\nby establishing industries in tribal and\nbackward areas.\n\ne Export of manufactured goods expands\ntrade and commerce, and brings in much\nneeded foreign exchange.\n\n¢ Countries that transform their raw\nmaterials into a wide variety of finished\ngoods of higher value are prosperous.\nIndia’s prosperity lies in increasing and\ndiversifying its manufacturing industries as\nquickly as possible.\n\nAgriculture and industry are not exclusive\nof each other. They move hand in hand. For\ninstance, the agro-industries in India have\ngiven a major boost to agriculture by raising\nits productivity. They depend on the latter for\nraw materials and sell their products such as\nirrigation pumps, fertilisers, insecticides,\npesticides, plastic and PVC pipes, machines\nand tools, etc. to the farmers. Thus,\ndevelopment and competitiveness of\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nmanufacturing industry has not only\nassisted agriculturists in increasing their\nproduction but also made the production\nprocesses very efficient.\n\nIn the present day world of globalisation,\nour industry needs to be more efficient and\ncompetitive. Self-sufficiency alone is not\nenough. Our manufactured goods must be\nat par in quality with those in the\ninternational market. Only then, will we be\nable to compete in the international market.\n\nClassification of Industries\n\nList the various manufactured products you\nuse in your daily life such as — transistors,\nelectric bulbs, vegetable oil, cement,\nglassware, petrol, matches, scooters,\nautomobiles, medicines and so on. If we\nclassify the various industries based on a\nparticular criterion then we would be\nable to understand their manufacturing\nbetter. Industries may be classified as\nfollows:\n\nOn the basis of source of raw materials\nused:\n\n¢ Agro based: cotton, woollen, jute, silk\ntextile, rubber and sugar, tea, coffee,\nedible oil.\n\ne Mineral based: iron and steel, cement,\naluminium, machine tools,\npetrochemicals.\n\nAccording to their main role:\n\n¢ Basic or key industries are those which\nsupply their products as raw materials to\nmanufacture other goods e.g. iron and\nsteel and copper smelting, aluminum\nsmelting.\n\n¢ Consumer industries that produce goods\nfor direct use by consumers — sugar,\ntoothpaste, paper, sewing machines,\n\nallowed on the assets of a unit. This limit\nhas changed over a period of time. At\npresent the maximum investment allowed\nis rupees one crore.\n\nOn the basis of ownership:\n\n¢ Public sector, owned and operated by\ngovernment agencies — BHEL, SAIL etc.\n\n¢ Private sector industries owned and\noperated by individuals or a group of\nindividuals -TISCO, Bajaj Auto Ltd.,\nDabur Industries.\n\nJoint sector industries which are jointly run\nby the state and individuals or a group of\nindividuals. Oil India Ltd. (OIL) is jointly\nowned by public and private sector.\n\n* Cooperative sector industries are owned\nand operated by the producers or\nsuppliers of raw materials, workers or\nboth. They pool in the resources and share\nthe profits or losses proportionately. Such\nexamples are the sugar industry in\nMaharashtra, the coir industry in Kerala.\n\nBased on the bulk and weight of raw material\nand finished goods:\n\n¢ Heavy industries such as iron and steel\n\ne ° Light industries that use light raw\n\nmaterials and produce light goods such\nas electrical goods industries.\n\nActivity\n\nClassify the following into two groups on the\nbasis of bulk and weight of raw material and\nfinished goods.\n\n(i) Oil (vi) Sewing Machines\n(ii) Knitting needles (vii) Shipbuilding\n(iii) Brassware (viii) Electric Bulbs\n(iv) Fuse wires (ix) Paint brushes\n(v) Watches (x) Automobiles\n\nfans etc. Agro-based Industries\nOn the basis of capital investment: Cotton, jute, silk, woollen textiles, sugar and\n¢ A small scale industry is defined with edible oil, etc. industries are based on\nreference to the maximum investment agricultural raw materials.\n\nMANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES 59\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nFibre\n\nSpinnin\nProduction P  ™\n\nWeaving\nKnitting\n\nDyeing and —> Garment\nFinishing <— manufacture\n\nRaw fibre i Yarn - Fabric ; Garments i\n\nFig. 6.1:\n\nTextile Industry: The textile industry\noccupies unique position in the Indian\neconomy, because it contributes significantly\nto industrial production, employment\ngeneration and foreign exchange earnings. It\nis the only industry in the country, which is\nself-reliant and complete in the value chain\ni.e., from raw material to the highest value\nadded products.\n\nCotton Textiles: In ancient India, cotton\ntextiles were produced with hand spinning\nand handloom weaving techniques. After\nthe 18\" century, power-looms came into\nuse. Our traditional industries suffered a\nsetback during the colonial period because\nthey could not compete with the mill-made\ncloth from England.\n\n* The first successful textile mill was (\n\nestablished in Mumbai in 1854.\n\n¢ The two world wars were fought in Europe,\n\nIndia was a British colony. There was a\n\ne demand for cloth in U.K. hence, they gave\n\na boost to the development of the cotton\ntextile industry.\n\nIn the early years, the cotton textile\nindustry was concentrated in the cotton\ngrowing belt of Maharashtra and Gujarat.\nAvailability of raw cotton, market, transport\nincluding accessible port facilities, labour,\nmoist climate, etc. contributed towards its\nlocalisation. This industry has close links\nwith agriculture and provides a living to\nfarmers, cotton boll pluckers and workers\nengaged in ginning, spinning, weaving,\n\n)\n\nValue addition in the textile industry\n\ndyeing, designing, packaging, tailoring and\nsewing. The industry by creating demands\nsupports many other industries, such as,\nchemicals and dyes, packaging materials\nand engineering works.\n\nWhile spinning continues to be centralised\nin Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu,\nweaving is highly decentralised to provide\nscope for incorporating traditional skills and\ndesigns of weaving in cotton, silk, zari,\nembroidery, etc. India has world class\nproduction in spinning, but weaving supplies\nlow quality of fabric as it cannot use much of\nthe high quality yarn produced in the country.\nWeaving is done by handloom, powerloom and\nin mills.\n\nThe handspun khadi provides large scale\nemployment to weavers in their homes as a\ncottage industry.\n\nWhy did Mahatma Gandhi lay emphasis on\nspinning yarn and weaving khadi?\n\nWhy is it important for our country to\nkeep the mill sector loomage lower than\npower loom and handloom?\n\nJute Textiles\n\nIndia is the largest producer of raw jute and\njute goods and stands at second place as an\nexporter after Bangladesh. Most of the mills are\nlocated in West Bengal, mainly along the banks\nof the Hugli river, in a narrow belt.\n\nThe first jute mill was set up near Kolkata in\n1855 at Rishra. After Partition in 1947, the ‘\njute mills remained in India but three-fourth ~\nof the jute producing area went to\nBangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan).\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\n68°E 12\n\nAFGHANISTAN\n36°N\n\nRa Baramula\n\n( f @=.Srinagar\n\neS abaninng :\n“*\n\nPAKISTAN (\n° Ss Tew\n32 Lye aay\n\nGo Airisar ;\n7 Cuchi\"\n\nMysay\n\nPanipat @ Moradabgé\n\ne Gurugram ®, s ee\n\nBikaner ‘a Agra\n\nJaipur®\nwate ;\n\ndid\n\ntet eden cent eweemneveswes sanity cc ‘\nwtsserereneaspece.\n\nRe 7 E Pepys Bankura ff\n\ne\nVerisidara Indore\n\n‘oho es\n® Wardha\n@ Aurangabad _ :\n\nARABIAN\nSEA\n\n® Pune\n\n16°\n\nLAKSHADWEEP\n(INDIA)\n\nINDIAN\n°F\n\nIndia: Distribution of cotton, woollen and silk industries\n\noe |.\n29e Shahjahanpur“+~.+-\n\n@@Kanpur =>\nVaranasi B | a ae *\n\nINDIA\nTEXTILE INDUSTRIES\n\n)\n\nCHINA\n( I 1B BT )\n\n. i\n\na -—~ -<° Dot Sl se\nLe BHUTAN 3... ./ oe\nNand Su, q ,\n\n\\\n\n7 ? 5 ~~\nMeet OC, \"a a Ss\n\n\"urshidabéd —.\n\n: Tropic of Cancer\n\n*“ Haora\nseh Seas\n\n@ COTTON TEXTILE\n@ WOOLLEN TEXTILE\nf SILK TEXTILE\n\nMANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nFactors responsible for their location in the\nHugli basin are: proximity of the jute producing\nareas, inexpensive water transport, supported\nby a good network of railways, roadways and\nwaterways to facilitate movement of raw\nmaterial to the mills, abundant water for\nprocessing raw jute, cheap labour from West\nBengal and adjoining states of Bihar, Odisha\nand Uttar Pradesh. Kolkata as a large urban\ncentre provides banking, insurance and port\nfacilities for export of jute goods.\n\nSugar Industry\n\nIndia stands second as a world producer of\nsugar but occupies the first place in the\nproduction of gur and khandsari. The raw\nmaterial used in this industry is bulky, and in\nhaulage its sucrose content reduces. The mills\nare located in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,\nMaharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra\nPradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana and\nMadhya Pradesh. Sixty per cent mills are in\nUttar Pradesh and Bihar. This industry is\nseasonal in nature so, it is ideally suited to the\ncooperative sector. Can you explain why this\nis so?\n\nIn recent years, there is a tendency for the\nmills to shift and concentrate in the southern\nand western states, especially in Maharashtra,\nThis is because the cane produced here has a\nhigher sucrose content. The cooler climate also\nensures a longer crushing season. Moreover,\nthe cooperatives are more successful in these\n\nMineral-based Industries\n\nIndustries that use minerals and metals as raw\nmaterials are called mineral-based industries.\nCan you name some industries that would fall\nin this category?\n\nIron and Steel Industry\n\nThe iron and steel industry is the basic industry\nsince all the other industries — heavy, medium\nand light, depend on it for their machinery.\nSteel is needed to manufacture a variety of\nengineering goods, construction material,\ndefence, medical, telephonic, scientific\nequipment and a variety of consumer goods.\n\nActivity\nMake a list of all such goods made of steel\nthat you can think of.\n\nProduction and consumption of steel is\noften regarded as the index of a country’s\ndevelopment. Iron and steel is a heavy industry\nbecause all the raw materials as well as\nfinished goods are heavy and bulky entailing\nheavy transportation costs. Iron ore, coking\ncoal and lime stone are required in the ratio of\napproximately 4 : 2: 1. Some quantities of\nmanganese, are also required to harden the\nsteel. Where should the steel plants be ideally\nlocated?

It is largely, because of the relative\nadvantages this region has for the development\nof this industry. These include, low cost of iron\nore, high grade raw materials in proximity,\ncheap labour and vast growth potential in the\nhome market.\n\nAluminium Smelting\n\nAluminium smelting is the second most\nimportant metallurgical industry in India. It is\nlight, resistant to corrosion, a good conductor of\nheat, malleable and becomes strong when it is\nmixed with other metals. It is used to\nmanufacture aircraft, utensils and wires. It has\ngained popularity as a substitute of steel, copper,\nzinc and lead in a number of industries.\n\nFig. 6.3: Strip coasting mill at smelter of NALCO\n\nAluminium smelting plants in the country\nare located in Odisha, West Bengal, Kerala,\nUttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and\nTamil Nadu.\n\nBauxite, the raw material used in the\nsmelters is a very bulky, dark reddish coloured\nrock. The flow chart given below shows the\nprocess of manufacturing aluminium. Regular\nsupply of electricity and an assured source of\nraw material at minimum cost are the two\nprime factors for location of the industry.\n\nChemical Industries\n\nThe Chemical industry in India is fast growing\nand diversifying. It comprises both large and\nsmall scale manufacturing units. Rapid growth\nhas been recorded in both inorganic and\norganic sectors. Inorganic chemicals include\nsulphuric acid (used to manufacture fertilizers,\nsynthetic fibres, plastics, adhesives, paints,\ndyes stuffs), nitric acid, alkalies, soda ash (used\nto make glass, soaps and detergents, paper)\nand caustic soda. These industries are widely\nspread over the country.\n\nWhy do you think it is so?\n\nOrganic chemicals include petrochemicals,\nwhich are used for manufacturing of synthetic\nfibers, synthetic rubber, plastics, dye-stuffs,\ndrugs and pharmaceuticals.

Basic chemicals undergo processing\nto further produce other chemicals that are\nused for industrial application, agriculture or\ndirectly for consumer markets. Make a list of\nthe products you are aware of.\n\nFertilizer Industry\n\nThe fertilizer industry is centred around the\nproduction of nitrogenous fertilizers (mainly\nurea), phosphatic fertilizers and ammonium\nphosphate (DAP) and complex fertilizers which\nhave a combination of nitrogen (N), phosphate\n(P), and potash (K). The third, i.e. potash is\nentirely imported as the country does not have\nany reserves of commercially usable potash or\npotassium compounds in any form.\n\nAfter the Green Revolution the industry\nexpanded to several other parts of the country.\nGujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and\nKerala contribute towards half of the fertilizer\nproduction. Other significant producers are\nAndhra Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Bihar,\nMaharashtra, Assam, West Bengal, Goa, Delhi,\nMadhya Pradesh and Karnataka.\n\nCement Industry\n\nCement is essential for construction activity\nsuch as building houses, factories, bridges,\nroads, airports, dams and for other commercial\nestablishments. This industry requires bulky\nand heavy raw materials like limestone, silica\nand gypsum. Coal and electric power are\nneeded apart from rail transportation.\n\nActivity\n\nWhere would it be economically viable to\n\nset up the cement manufacturing units?\n\nThe industry has strategically located\nplants in Gujarat that have suitable access to\nthe market in the Gulf countries.\n\nActivity\nFind out where the plants are located in other\nStates of India. Find their names.\n\nThe first cement plant was set-up in\nChennai in 1904. After Independence the\nindustry expanded.\n\nAutomobile Industry\n\nAutomobiles provide vehicle for quick\ntransport of good services and passengers.\nTrucks, buses, cars, motor cycles, scooters,\nthree-wheelers and multi-utility vehicles are\nmanufactured in India at various centres. After\nthe liberalisation, the coming in of new and\ncontemporary models stimulated the demand\nfor vehicles in the market, which led to the\nhealthy growth of the industry including\npassenger cars, two and three-wheelers. The\nindustry is located around Delhi, Gurugram,\nMumbai, Pune, Chennai, Kolkata, Lucknow,\nIndore, Hyderabad, Jamshedpur and\nBengaluru.\n\nInformation Technology and\nElectronics Industry\n\nThe electronics industry covers a wide range\nof products from transistor sets to television,\ntelephones, cellular telecom, telephone\nexchange, radars, computers and many\nother equipments required by the\ntelecommunication industry. Bengaluru has\nemerged as the electronic capital of India. Other\nimportant centres for electronic goods are\nMumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Pune, Chennai,\nKolkata, Lucknow and Coimbatore. The major\nindustry concentration is at Bengaluru, Noida,\nMumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune. A\nmajor impact of this industry has been on\nemployment generation. The continuing\ngrowth in the hardware and software is the key\nto the success of IT industry in India.\n\nalee\nwv 2\n\ned p =\n\nFig. 6.6: Cable manufacturing facilities at HCL,\nRupnarainpur (West Bengal)\n\nMANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n>\n\n\nIndustrial Pollution and Environmental\nDegradation\n\nAlthough industries contribute significantly to\nIndia’s economic growth and development, the\nincrease in pollution of land, water, air, noise\nand resulting degradation of environment that\nthey have caused, cannot be overlooked.\nIndustries are responsible for four types of\npollution: (a) Air (b) Water (c) Land (d) Noise.\nThe polluting industries also include thermal\npower plants.\n\nAir pollution is caused by the presence of high\nproportion of undesirable gases, such as\nsulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Air-\nborne particulate materials contain both solid\nand liquid particles like dust, sprays mist and\nsmoke. Smoke is emitted by chemical and\npaper factories, brick kilns, refineries and\nsmelting plants, and burning of fossil fuels in\nbig and small factories that ignore pollution\nnorms. Toxic gas leaks can be very hazardous\nwith long-term effects. Are you aware of the\nBhopal Gas tragedy that occurred? Air\npollution adversely affects human health,\nanimals, plants, buildings and the atmosphere\nas a whole.\n\nWater pollution is caused by organic and\ninorganic industrial wastes and affluents\ndischarged into rivers. The main culprits in this\nregard are paper, pulp, chemical, textile and\ndyeing, petroleum refineries, tanneries and\nelectroplating industries that let out dyes,\ndetergents, acids, salts and heavy metals like\nlead and mercury pesticides, fertilisers,\nsynthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and\nrubber, etc. into the water bodies. Fly ash,\nphospo- gypsum and iron and steel slags are\nthe major solid wastes in India.\n\nThermal pollution of water occurs when hot\nwater from factories and thermal plants is\ndrained into rivers and ponds before cooling.\nWhat would be the effect on aquatic life?\nWastes from nuclear power plants, nuclear\nand weapon production facilities cause\ncancers, birth defects and miscarriages. Soil\nand water pollution are closely related.\n\nDumping of wastes specially glass, harmful\nchemicals, industrial effluents, packaging, salts\nand garbage renders the soil useless. Rain\nwater percolates to the soil carrying the\npollutants to the ground and the ground water\nalso gets contaminated.\n\nNoise pollution not only results in irritation\nand anger, it can also cause hearing\nimpairment, increased heart rate and blood\npressure among other physiological effects.\nUnwanted sound is an irritant and a source of\nstress. Industrial and construction activities,\nmachinery, factory equipment, generators,\nsaws and pneumatic and electric drills also\nmake a lot of noise.\n\nControl of Environmental Degradation\n\nEvery litre of waste water discharged by our\nindustry pollutes eight times the quantity of\nfreshwater. How can the industrial pollution of\nfresh water be reduced? Some suggestions are-\n(i) minimising use water for processing by\nreusing and recycling it in two or more\nsuccessive stages\n\n(ii) harvesting of rainwater to meet water\nrequirements\n\n(iii) treating hot water and effluents before\nreleasing them in rivers and ponds.\nTreatment of industrial effluents can be\ndone in three phases\n\n(a) Primary treatment by mechanical means.\nThis involves screening, grinding,\nflocculation and sedimentation.\n\n(b) Secondary treatment by biological process\n\n(c) Tertiary treatment by biological,\nchemical and physical processes. This\ninvolves recycling of wastewater.\n\nOverdrawing of ground water reserves by\n\nindustry where there is a threat to ground\nwater resources also needs to be regulated\nlegally. Particulate matter in the air can be\nreduced by fitting smoke stacks to factories\nwith electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters,\nscrubbers and inertial separators. Smoke\ncan be reduced by using oil or gas instead\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\n68°E 12°\n\nAFGHANISTAN\n36°N\n\nPAKISTAN\n39°\n\n/S 4 ial\n: hali i\nJj Mo alii\n\nNiger oe\nBes rises Se\n\n‘29 Noida ~\n\nJaipur %& So w..\n\nARABIAN\nSEA\n\n(Ce 5\n\n16° ge ; Hyderabad\n\nsor\n\n° Ore\né\n\n“. -\n\nbad e\n\nLAKSHADWEEP\n\nINDIAN\n72°E\n\nim _¢ .\nut seee\n\n36°N\nINDIA\n\nSOME SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY PARKS\n\nCHINA\nCTIBET )\n\nati >\n\n€\n\nr-\n\nBAY OF\nBENGAL\n\nVishakhapatnam\n\nANDAMAN & NICOBAR ISLANDS\n(INDIA)\n°\n600 km es Q\n*» 8°N\n°\n\n92°F\n\nIndia: Some Software Technology Parks\n\nMANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nof coal in factories.

His mother ~\npurchased utensils, sugar, tea and diyas\n(earthen lamps). Harish observed that the\nshops in the market were flooded with\nitems for sale. He wondered how so many\nitems could be made in such large\nquantities. His father explained that shoes,\nclothes, sugar etc. are manufactured by\nmachines in large industries, some utensils\nare manufactured in small industries, while\nitems like diyas are made by individual\nartisans in household industry.\n\nDo you have some ideas about these\nindustries?\n\nProduction of goods in large quantities after\nprocessing from raw materials to more\nvaluable products is called manufacturing. Do\nyou know that paper is manufactured from\nwood, sugar from sugarcane, iron and steel\nfrom iron ore and aluminium from bauxite?\nDo you also know that some types of clothes\nare manufactured from yarn which itself is an\nindustrial product?\n\nPeople employed in the secondary activities\nmanufacture the primary materials into\nfinished goods. The workers employed in steel\nfactories, car, breweries, textile industries,\nbakeries etc. fall into this category. Some people\nare employed in providing services. In this\nchapter, we are mainly concerned with\nmanufacturing industries which fall in the\nsecondary sector.\n\nThe economic strength of a country is\nmeasured by the development of\nmanufacturing industries.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF MANUFACTURING\n\nManufacturing sector is considered the backbone\nof development in general and economic\ndevelopment in particular mainly because-\n\ne Manufacturing industries not only help in\nmodernising agriculture, which forms the\nbackbone of our economy, they also reduce\nthe heavy dependence of people on\nagricultural income by providing them jobs\nin secondary and tertiary sectors.\n\n¢ Industrial development is a precondition for\neradication of unemployment and poverty\nfrom our country. This was the main\nphilosophy behind public sector industries\nand joint sector ventures in India. It was also\naimed at bringing down regional disparities\nby establishing industries in tribal and\nbackward areas.\n\ne Export of manufactured goods expands\ntrade and commerce, and brings in much\nneeded foreign exchange.\n\n¢ Countries that transform their raw\nmaterials into a wide variety of finished\ngoods of higher value are prosperous.\nIndia’s prosperity lies in increasing and\ndiversifying its manufacturing industries as\nquickly as possible.\n\nAgriculture and industry are not exclusive\nof each other. They move hand in hand. For\ninstance, the agro-industries in India have\ngiven a major boost to agriculture by raising\nits productivity.

The industry by creating demands\nsupports many other industries, such as,\nchemicals and dyes, packaging materials\nand engineering works.\n\nWhile spinning continues to be centralised\nin Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu,\nweaving is highly decentralised to provide\nscope for incorporating traditional skills and\ndesigns of weaving in cotton, silk, zari,\nembroidery, etc. India has world class\nproduction in spinning, but weaving supplies\nlow quality of fabric as it cannot use much of\nthe high quality yarn produced in the country.\nWeaving is done by handloom, powerloom and\nin mills.\n\nThe handspun khadi provides large scale\nemployment to weavers in their homes as a\ncottage industry.\n\nWhy did Mahatma Gandhi lay emphasis on\nspinning yarn and weaving khadi?\n\nWhy is it important for our country to\nkeep the mill sector loomage lower than\npower loom and handloom?\n\nJute Textiles\n\nIndia is the largest producer of raw jute and\njute goods and stands at second place as an\nexporter after Bangladesh. Most of the mills are\nlocated in West Bengal, mainly along the banks\nof the Hugli river, in a narrow belt.\n\nThe first jute mill was set up near Kolkata in\n1855 at Rishra. After Partition in 1947, the ‘\njute mills remained in India but three-fourth ~\nof the jute producing area went to\nBangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan).\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

Kolkata as a large urban\ncentre provides banking, insurance and port\nfacilities for export of jute goods.\n\nSugar Industry\n\nIndia stands second as a world producer of\nsugar but occupies the first place in the\nproduction of gur and khandsari. The raw\nmaterial used in this industry is bulky, and in\nhaulage its sucrose content reduces. The mills\nare located in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,\nMaharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra\nPradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana and\nMadhya Pradesh. Sixty per cent mills are in\nUttar Pradesh and Bihar. This industry is\nseasonal in nature so, it is ideally suited to the\ncooperative sector. Can you explain why this\nis so?\n\nIn recent years, there is a tendency for the\nmills to shift and concentrate in the southern\nand western states, especially in Maharashtra,\nThis is because the cane produced here has a\nhigher sucrose content. The cooler climate also\nensures a longer crushing season. Moreover,\nthe cooperatives are more successful in these\n\nMineral-based Industries\n\nIndustries that use minerals and metals as raw\nmaterials are called mineral-based industries.\nCan you name some industries that would fall\nin this category?\n\nIron and Steel Industry\n\nThe iron and steel industry is the basic industry\nsince all the other industries — heavy, medium\nand light, depend on it for their machinery.\nSteel is needed to manufacture a variety of\nengineering goods, construction material,\ndefence, medical, telephonic, scientific\nequipment and a variety of consumer goods.\n\nActivity\nMake a list of all such goods made of steel\nthat you can think of.\n\nProduction and consumption of steel is\noften regarded as the index of a country’s\ndevelopment. Iron and steel is a heavy industry\nbecause all the raw materials as well as\nfinished goods are heavy and bulky entailing\nheavy transportation costs. Iron ore, coking\ncoal and lime stone are required in the ratio of\napproximately 4 : 2: 1. Some quantities of\nmanganese, are also required to harden the\nsteel.

        "text": "Industrial Pollution and Environmental\nDegradation\n\nAlthough industries contribute significantly to\nIndia’s economic growth and development, the\nincrease in pollution of land, water, air, noise\nand resulting degradation of environment that\nthey have caused, cannot be overlooked.\nIndustries are responsible for four types of\npollution: (a) Air (b) Water (c) Land (d) Noise.\nThe polluting industries also include thermal\npower plants.\n\nAir pollution is caused by the presence of high\nproportion of undesirable gases, such as\nsulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Air-\nborne particulate materials contain both solid\nand liquid particles like dust, sprays mist and\nsmoke. Smoke is emitted by chemical and\npaper factories, brick kilns, refineries and\nsmelting plants, and burning of fossil fuels in\nbig and small factories that ignore pollution\nnorms. Toxic gas leaks can be very hazardous\nwith long-term effects. Are you aware of the\nBhopal Gas tragedy that occurred? Air\npollution adversely affects human health,\nanimals, plants, buildings and the atmosphere\nas a whole.\n\nWater pollution is caused by organic and\ninorganic industrial wastes and affluents\ndischarged into rivers. The main culprits in this\nregard are paper, pulp, chemical, textile and\ndyeing, petroleum refineries, tanneries and\nelectroplating industries that let out dyes,\ndetergents, acids, salts and heavy metals like\nlead and mercury pesticides, fertilisers,\nsynthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and\nrubber, etc. into the water bodies. Fly ash,\nphospo- gypsum and iron and steel slags are\nthe major solid wastes in India.\n\nThermal pollution of water occurs when hot\nwater from factories and thermal plants is\ndrained into rivers and ponds before cooling.\nWhat would be the effect on aquatic life?\nWastes from nuclear power plants, nuclear\nand weapon production facilities cause\ncancers, birth defects and miscarriages. Soil\nand water pollution are closely related.\n\nDumping of wastes specially glass, harmful\nchemicals, industrial effluents, packaging, salts\nand garbage renders the soil useless. Rain\nwater percolates to the soil carrying the\npollutants to the ground and the ground water\nalso gets contaminated.\n\nNoise pollution not only results in irritation\nand anger, it can also cause hearing\nimpairment, increased heart rate and blood\npressure among other physiological effects.\nUnwanted sound is an irritant and a source of\nstress. Industrial and construction activities,\nmachinery, factory equipment, generators,\nsaws and pneumatic and electric drills also\nmake a lot of noise.\n\nControl of Environmental Degradation\n\nEvery litre of waste water discharged by our\nindustry pollutes eight times the quantity of\nfreshwater. How can the industrial pollution of\nfresh water be reduced? Some suggestions are-\n(i) minimising use water for processing by\nreusing and recycling it in two or more\nsuccessive stages\n\n(ii) harvesting of rainwater to meet water\nrequirements\n\n(iii) treating hot water and effluents before\nreleasing them in rivers and ponds.\nTreatment of industrial effluents can be\ndone in three phases\n\n(a) Primary treatment by mechanical means.\nThis involves screening, grinding,\nflocculation and sedimentation.\n\n(b) Secondary treatment by biological process\n\n(c) Tertiary treatment by biological,\nchemical and physical processes. This\ninvolves recycling of wastewater.\n\nOverdrawing of ground water reserves by\n\nindustry where there is a threat to ground\nwater resources also needs to be regulated\nlegally. Particulate matter in the air can be\nreduced by fitting smoke stacks to factories\nwith electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters,\nscrubbers and inertial separators. Smoke\ncan be reduced by using oil or gas instead\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

Some of these are available in our\nimmediate surroundings, while other\nrequirements are met by bringing things from\nother places. Goods and services do not move\nfrom supply locales to demand locales on their\nown. The movement of these goods and services\nfrom their supply locations to demand locations\nnecessitates the need for transport. Some people\nare engaged in facilitating these movements.\nThese are known to be traders who make the\nproducts come to the consumers by\ntransportation. Thus, the pace of development\nof a country depends upon the production of\ngoods and services as well as their movement\nover space. Therefore, efficient means of transport\nare prerequisites for fast development.\nMovement of these goods and services can be\nover three important domains of our earth i.e. land,\nwater and air. Based on these, transport can also\nbe classified into land, water and air transport.\n\nthe help of equally developed communication\nsystem. Therefore, transport, communication\nand trade are complementary to each other.\n\nToday, India is well-linked with the rest of\nthe world despite its vast size, diversity and\nlinguistic and socio-cultural plurality.\nRailways, airways, waterways, newspapers,\nradio, television, cinema and internet, etc. have\nbeen contributing to its socio-economic\nprogress in many ways. The trades from local\nto international levels have added to the vitality\nof its economy. It has enriched our life and\nadded substantially to growing amenities and\nfacilities for the comforts of life.\n\nIn this chapter, you will see how modern\nmeans of transport and communication serve\nas lifelines of our nation and its modern\neconomy. It is thus, evident that a dense and\nefficient network of transport and\ncommunication is a prerequisite for local,\nnational and global trade of today.\n\nMeans of Transport\n\nSS —,,\n\nLand Water Air |\nRoadways Railways Pipelines Inland Overseas nae ee a\nPublic Undertaking\nPrivate Airlines\nFig. 7.1\nFor a long time, trade and transport were ‘TRANSPORT\nrestricted to a limited space.

Today, the world has\nbeen converted into a large village with the help\nof efficient and fast moving transport.\nTransport has been able to achieve this with\n\nIndia has second largest road networks in the\nworld, aggregating to about 62.16 lakh km\n(2020-21). In India, roadways have preceded\nrailways. They still have an edge over railways\nin view of the ease with which they can be built\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nand maintained. The growing importance of\nroad transport vis-a-vis rail transport is\nrooted in the following reasons; (a)\nconstruction cost of roads is much lower\nthan that of railway lines, (b) roads can\ntraverse comparatively more dissected and\nundulating topography, (c) roads can\nnegotiate higher gradients of slopes and as\nsuch can traverse mountains such as the\nHimalayas, (d) road transport is economical\nin transportation of few persons and\nrelatively smaller amount of goods over\nshort distances, (e) it also provides door-\nto-door service, thus the cost of loading\nand unloading is much lower, (f) road\ntransport is also used as a feeder to other\nmodes of transport such as they provide a\nlink between railway stations, air and\nsea ports.\n\nIn India, roads are classified in the\nfollowing six classes according to their\ncapacity. Look at the map of the National\nHighways and find out about the significant\nrole played by these roads.\n\n¢ Golden Quadrilateral Super Highways:\nThe government has launched a major\nroad development project linking Delhi-\nKolkata-Chennai-Mumbai and Delhi by\nsix-lane Super Highways. The North-\nSouth corridors linking Srinagar (Jammu\n& Kashmir) and Kanniyakumari (Tamil\nNadu), and East-West Corridor\nconnecting Silchar (Assam) and Porbander\n(Gujarat) are part of this project. The\nmajor objective of these Super Highways\nis to reduce the time and distance\nbetween the mega cities of India.

Railways also make it possible for\npeople to conduct multifarious activities\nlike business, sightseeing, pilgrimage\nalong with transportation of goods over\nlonger distances. Apart from an important\nmeans of transport the Indian Railways\nhave been a great integrating force for more\nthan 150 years. Railways in India bind the\neconomic life of the country as well as\naccelerate the development of the industry\nand agriculture.\n\n8\nThe Indian Railways is the largest public\n\ne sector undertaking in the country. The first\ntrain steamed off from Mumbai to Thane in\n1853, covering a distance of 34 km.\n\nThe Indian Railway is now reorganised into\n17 zones.\n\n- Activity ————+\nFind out the current Railway zones and their\nheadquarters. Also locate the headquarters\nof Railway zones on the map of India.\n\nThe distribution pattern of the Railway\nnetwork in the country has been largely\ninfluenced by physiographic, economic and\nadministrative factors. The northern plains with\ntheir vast level land, high population density\nand rich agricultural resources provided the most\nfavourable condition for their growth. However,\na large number of rivers requiring construction\nof bridges across their wide beds posed some\nobstacles. In the hilly terrains of the peninsular\nregion, railway tracts are laid through low hills,\ngaps or tunnels. The Himalayan mountainous\nregions too are unfavourable for the construction\nof railway lines due to high relief, sparse\npopulation and lack of economic opportunities.\nLikewise, it was difficult to lay railway lines on\nthe sandy plain of western Rajasthan, swamps\nof Gujarat, forested tracks of Madhya Pradesh,\nChhattisgarh, Odisha and Jharkhand. The\ncontiguous stretch of Sahyadri could be crossed\n\n\n\nTable 7.1: India: Railway Track\nThe Indian Railway network runs on multiple gauge operations extending over 67,956 km.\n\nGauge in metres\n\nBroad Gauge (1.676)\n\nMetre Gauge (1.000)\nNarrow Gauge (0.762 and 0.610)\n\nRoute (Km)\n\nSource: Railway Yearbook 2019-20, Ministry of Railways, Government of India.\n\nWebsite: www.indianrailways.gov.in\n\nonly through gaps or passes (Ghats). In recent\ntimes, the development of the Konkan railway\nalong the west coast has facilitated the movement\nof passengers and goods in this most important\neconomic region of India. It has also faced a\nnumber of problem such as sinking of track in\nsome stretches and landslides.\n\nToday, the railways have become more\nimportant in our national economy than all\nother means of transport put together. However,\nrail transport suffers from certain problems as\nwell. Many passengers travel without tickets.\nThefts and damaging of railway property has\nnot yet stopped completely. People stop the\ntrains, pull the chain unnecessarily and this\ncauses heavy damage to the railway. Think over\nit, how we can help our railway in running as\nper the scheduled time?\n\nPipelines\n\nPipeline transport network is a new arrival on\nthe transportation map of India. In the past,\nthese were used to transport water to cities and\nindustries. Now, these are used for transporting\ncrude oil, petroleum products and natural gas\nfrom oil and natural gas fields to refineries,\nfertilizer factories and big thermal power plants.\nSolids can also be transported through a\npipeline when converted into slurry. The far\ninland locations of refineries like Barauni,\nMathura, Panipat and gas based fertilizer plants\ncould be thought of only because of pipelines.\nInitial cost of laying pipelines is high but\nsubsequent running costs are minimal. It rules\nout trans-shipment losses or delays.\n\nThere are three important networks of\npipeline transportation in the country.\n\ne From oil field in upper Assam to Kanpur\n(Uttar Pradesh), via Guwahati, Barauni and\nPrayagraj. It has branches from Barauni to\nHaldia, via Rajbandh, Rajbandh to\nMaurigram and Guwahati to Siliguri.\n\ne From Salaya in Gujarat to Jalandhar in\nPunjab, via Viramgam, Mathura, Delhi and\nSonipat. It has branches to connect Koyali\n(near Vadodara, Gujarat) Chakshu and\nother places.\n\ne The first 1,700 km long Hazira-Vijaipur-\nJagdishpur (HVJ) cross country gas\npipeline, linked Mumbai High and Bassein\ngas fields with various ferilizer, power and\nindustrial complexes in western and\nnorthern India. Overall, India’s gas pipeline\ninfrastructure has expanded from 1,700 km\nto 18,500 km of cross-country pipelines.\n\nWaterways\n\nSince the ancient period, India was one of the\nseafaring countries. Its seamen sailed far and\nnear, thus, carrying and spreading Indian\ncommerce and culture. Waterways are the\ncheapest means of transport. They are most\nsuitable for carrying heavy and bulky goods. It\nis a fuel-efficient and environment friendly mode\nof transport. India has inland navigation\nwaterways of 14,500 km in length. In order to\ncreate wide waterways network and to promote\ninland water transport in the country as an\neconomical environment friendly\nsupplementary mode of transport to rail and\nroad, 111 inland waterways (including 5\nNational Waterways declared earlier) were\ndeclared as National Waterways (NWs) by the\nNational Waterways Act, 2016.

But, the pace of change, has\nbeen rapid in modern times. Long distance\ncommunication is far easier without physical\nmovement of the communicator or receiver.\nPersonal communication and mass\ncommunication including television, radio,\npress, films, etc. are the major means of\ncommunication in the country. The Indian\npostal network is the largest in the world. It\nhandles parcels as well as personal written\ncommunications. Cards and envelopes are\nconsidered first-class mail and are airlifted\nbetween stations covering both land and air.\nThe second-class mail includes book packets,\nregistered newspapers and periodicals. They\nare carried by surface mail, covering land and\nwater transport. To facilitate quick delivery\nof mails in large towns and cities, six mail\nchannels have been introduced recently.

It\nproduces short films; video feature films and\nvideo short films. The Central Board of Film\nCertification is the authority to certify both\nIndian and foreign films.\n\nInternational Trade\n\nThe exchange of goods among people, states\nand countries is referred to as trade. The\nmarket is the place where such exchanges\ntake place. Trade between two countries is\ncalled international trade. It may take place\nthrough sea, air or land routes. While local\ntrade is carried in cities, towns and villages,\nstate level trade is carried between two or more\nstates. Advancement of international trade of\na country is an index to its economic\nprosperity. It is, therefore, considered the\neconomic barometer for a country.\n\nAs the resources are space bound, no\ncountry can survive without international\ntrade. Export and import are the components\nof trade. The balance of trade of a country is\nthe difference between its export and import.\nWhen the value of export exceeds the value\nof imports, it is called a favourable balance\nof trade. On the contrary, if the value of\nimports exceeds the value of exports, it is\ntermed as unfavourable balance of trade.\n\nIndia has trade relations with all the major\ntrading blocks and all geographical regions\nof the world.

The movement of these goods and services\nfrom their supply locations to demand locations\nnecessitates the need for transport. Some people\nare engaged in facilitating these movements.\nThese are known to be traders who make the\nproducts come to the consumers by\ntransportation. Thus, the pace of development\nof a country depends upon the production of\ngoods and services as well as their movement\nover space. Therefore, efficient means of transport\nare prerequisites for fast development.\nMovement of these goods and services can be\nover three important domains of our earth i.e. land,\nwater and air.

The growing importance of\nroad transport vis-a-vis rail transport is\nrooted in the following reasons; (a)\nconstruction cost of roads is much lower\nthan that of railway lines, (b) roads can\ntraverse comparatively more dissected and\nundulating topography, (c) roads can\nnegotiate higher gradients of slopes and as\nsuch can traverse mountains such as the\nHimalayas, (d) road transport is economical\nin transportation of few persons and\nrelatively smaller amount of goods over\nshort distances, (e) it also provides door-\nto-door service, thus the cost of loading\nand unloading is much lower, (f) road\ntransport is also used as a feeder to other\nmodes of transport such as they provide a\nlink between railway stations, air and\nsea ports.\n\nIn India, roads are classified in the\nfollowing six classes according to their\ncapacity. Look at the map of the National\nHighways and find out about the significant\nrole played by these roads.\n\n¢ Golden Quadrilateral Super Highways:\nThe government has launched a major\nroad development project linking Delhi-\nKolkata-Chennai-Mumbai and Delhi by\nsix-lane Super Highways. The North-\nSouth corridors linking Srinagar (Jammu\n& Kashmir) and Kanniyakumari (Tamil\nNadu), and East-West Corridor\nconnecting Silchar (Assam) and Porbander\n(Gujarat) are part of this project. The\nmajor objective of these Super Highways\nis to reduce the time and distance\nbetween the mega cities of India. These\nhighway projects are being implemented\nby the National Highway Authority of\nIndia (NHAI).\n\ne National Highways: National Highways\nlink extreme parts of the country. These\nare the primary road systems. A number\nof major National Highways run in North-\nSouth and East-West directions.\n\ne State Highways: Roads linking a state\ncapital with different district headquarters\nare known as State Highways.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig.7.2: Ahmedabad- Vadodara Expressway\n\nActivity ff.\n\nCollect information of National Highway\nnumbers (old and new) from the website\nmorth.nic.in/national-highway-details. The\nhistorical Sher-Shah Suri Marg between\nDelhi and Amritsar is known by which\nNational Highway ?\n\nDistrict Roads: These roads connect the\ndistrict headquarters with other places of\nthe district.\n\nOther Roads: Rural roads, which link rural\nareas and villages with towns, are classified\nunder this category. These roads received\nspecial impetus under the Pradhan Mantri\nGrameen Sadak Yojana. Under this scheme\nspecial provisions are made so that every\nvillage in the country is linked to a major\ntown in the country by an all season\nmotorable road.\n\nBorder Roads: Apart from these, Border\nRoads Organisation a Government of India\nundertaking constructs and maintains\nroads in the bordering areas of the\ncountry. This organisation was established\nin 1960 for the development of the roads\nof strategic importance in the northern and\nnorth-eastern border areas. These roads\nhave improved accessibility in areas of\ndifficult terrain and have helped in the\neconomic development of these area.\n\n",

Apart from an important\nmeans of transport the Indian Railways\nhave been a great integrating force for more\nthan 150 years. Railways in India bind the\neconomic life of the country as well as\naccelerate the development of the industry\nand agriculture.\n\n8\nThe Indian Railways is the largest public\n\ne sector undertaking in the country. The first\ntrain steamed off from Mumbai to Thane in\n1853, covering a distance of 34 km.\n\nThe Indian Railway is now reorganised into\n17 zones.\n\n- Activity ————+\nFind out the current Railway zones and their\nheadquarters. Also locate the headquarters\nof Railway zones on the map of India.\n\nThe distribution pattern of the Railway\nnetwork in the country has been largely\ninfluenced by physiographic, economic and\nadministrative factors. The northern plains with\ntheir vast level land, high population density\nand rich agricultural resources provided the most\nfavourable condition for their growth. However,\na large number of rivers requiring construction\nof bridges across their wide beds posed some\nobstacles. In the hilly terrains of the peninsular\nregion, railway tracts are laid through low hills,\ngaps or tunnels. The Himalayan mountainous\nregions too are unfavourable for the construction\nof railway lines due to high relief, sparse\npopulation and lack of economic opportunities.\nLikewise, it was difficult to lay railway lines on\nthe sandy plain of western Rajasthan, swamps\nof Gujarat, forested tracks of Madhya Pradesh,\nChhattisgarh, Odisha and Jharkhand. The\ncontiguous stretch of Sahyadri could be crossed\n\n",

It has also faced a\nnumber of problem such as sinking of track in\nsome stretches and landslides.\n\nToday, the railways have become more\nimportant in our national economy than all\nother means of transport put together. However,\nrail transport suffers from certain problems as\nwell. Many passengers travel without tickets.\nThefts and damaging of railway property has\nnot yet stopped completely. People stop the\ntrains, pull the chain unnecessarily and this\ncauses heavy damage to the railway. Think over\nit, how we can help our railway in running as\nper the scheduled time?\n\nPipelines\n\nPipeline transport network is a new arrival on\nthe transportation map of India. In the past,\nthese were used to transport water to cities and\nindustries. Now, these are used for transporting\ncrude oil, petroleum products and natural gas\nfrom oil and natural gas fields to refineries,\nfertilizer factories and big thermal power plants.\nSolids can also be transported through a\npipeline when converted into slurry. The far\ninland locations of refineries like Barauni,\nMathura, Panipat and gas based fertilizer plants\ncould be thought of only because of pipelines.\nInitial cost of laying pipelines is high but\nsubsequent running costs are minimal. It rules\nout trans-shipment losses or delays.\n\nThere are three important networks of\npipeline transportation in the country.\n\ne From oil field in upper Assam to Kanpur\n(Uttar Pradesh), via Guwahati, Barauni and\nPrayagraj. It has branches from Barauni to\nHaldia, via Rajbandh, Rajbandh to\nMaurigram and Guwahati to Siliguri.\n\ne From Salaya in Gujarat to Jalandhar in\nPunjab, via Viramgam, Mathura, Delhi and\nSonipat. It has branches to connect Koyali\n(near Vadodara, Gujarat) Chakshu and\nother places.\n\ne The first 1,700 km long Hazira-Vijaipur-\nJagdishpur (HVJ) cross country gas\npipeline, linked Mumbai High and Bassein\ngas fields with various ferilizer, power and\nindustrial complexes in western and\nnorthern India. Overall, India’s gas pipeline\ninfrastructure has expanded from 1,700 km\nto 18,500 km of cross-country pipelines.\n\nWaterways\n\nSince the ancient period, India was one of the\nseafaring countries. Its seamen sailed far and\nnear, thus, carrying and spreading Indian\ncommerce and culture. Waterways are the\ncheapest means of transport. They are most\nsuitable for carrying heavy and bulky goods. It\nis a fuel-efficient and environment friendly mode\nof transport. India has inland navigation\nwaterways of 14,500 km in length. In order to\ncreate wide waterways network and to promote\ninland water transport in the country as an\neconomical environment friendly\nsupplementary mode of transport to rail and\nroad, 111 inland waterways (including 5\nNational Waterways declared earlier) were\ndeclared as National Waterways (NWs) by the\nNational Waterways Act, 2016.

The syllabi and textbooks developed on\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system\nof education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own\nlearning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must\nrecognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one\nof the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat\nchildren as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of\nknowledge.\n\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode\nof functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour\nin implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of\nteaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for\nteaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook\nproves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather\nthan a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to\naddress the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and\nreorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for\nchild psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook\nattempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space\nto opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small\ngroups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\n\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the\nadvisory committee for textbooks in Social Sciences, at the higher\nsecondary level, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for this\nbook, Professor M.H. Qureshi for guiding the work of this committee.\nSeveral teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are\ngrateful to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nthe institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw\nupon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the\nmembers of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department\nof Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development\nunder the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P.\nDeshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an organisation\ncommitted to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its\nproducts, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to\nundertake further revision and refinement.\n\nDirector\nNew Delhi National Council of Educational\n20 November 2006 Research and Training\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce\ncontent load on students. The National Education Policy 2020,\nalso emphasises reducing the content load and providing\nopportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In\nthis background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to\nrationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes\nalready developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken\ninto consideration in this exercise.\n\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of\nthe following:\n\n° Overlapping with similar content included in other subject\n\nareas in the same class\n\n° Similar content included in the lower or higher class in\nthe same subject\n\ne Difficulty level\n\n° Content, which is easily accessible to students without\nmuch interventions from teachers and can be learned by\nchildren through self-learning or peer-learning\n\n° Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\n\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying\nout the changes given above.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nCHAIRPERSON, ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR TEXTBOOKS IN SOCIAL SCIENCES AT\nTHE SECONDARY LEVEL\n\nHari Vasudevan, Professor, Department of History, University of\nCalcutta, Kolkata\n\nCureEFr ADVISOR\n\nM.

        "text": "The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that\nchildren’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.\nThis principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning\nwhich continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the\nschool, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system\nof education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own\nlearning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must\nrecognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one\nof the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat\nchildren as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of\nknowledge.\n\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode\nof functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour\nin implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of\nteaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for\nteaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook\nproves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather\nthan a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to\naddress the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and\nreorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for\nchild psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook\nattempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space\nto opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small\ngroups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\n\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the\nadvisory committee for textbooks in Social Sciences, at the higher\nsecondary level, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for this\nbook, Professor M.H. Qureshi for guiding the work of this committee.\nSeveral teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are\ngrateful to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",
