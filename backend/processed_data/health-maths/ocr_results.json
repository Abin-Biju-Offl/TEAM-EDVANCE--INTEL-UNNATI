These activities not only\nrequire involvement of the body but also require use of the\nintellect to carry out the task. Positive, healthy and active\nbody-mind relationship helps to enhance mental efficiency.\n\nScope OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION\n\nPhysical education has evolved as a multi-disciplinary subject\nand its scope is not just confined to physical fitness and the\nrules of games and sports. The meaning and definition of\nPhysical Education, its aims and objectives and scope, and\nfactors affecting physical fitness and wellness, rules and\nother necessary knowledge about health, games and sports\nand yoga are major areas of study in physical education.\nGames and sports, as well as, cultural heritage, development\nof leadership qualities and group dynamics through sports\nand games are also an integral part of this discipline.\n\nIn fact, physical education now includes several areas\nwhich belong to other subjects like Biology, Genetics,\nPsychology, Physics, Bio Chemistry, Sociology, Anthropology,\nHistory, Culture, Medicine, Media studies, etc.\n\nContents from other disciplines like laws of motion, types\nof lever, force, equilibrium and centre of gravity, common\npostural deviations, therapeutic modalities in rehabilitation,\nsports massage, prevention and first aid for common sport-\ninjuries, are also the content of physical education.

What is Coronavirus?\n\nCovid 19 is the infectious disease caused by the recently discovered coronavirus. This\nnew virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in\nDecember 2019. That is why it is called the Novel (new) Coronavirus (NCoV).\n\n2. What are the symptoms?\n\nThe most common symptoms of Coronavirus are fever, cough and difficulty in breathing.\nSome patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or\ndiarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become\ninfected but don’t develop any symptoms and dont’t feel unwell. Most people (about\n80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. People with fever\ncough and difficulty in breathing should seek medical attention immediately.\n\n3. How does Coronavirus spread?\n\nPeople can catch Coronavirus from others who have the virus. The disease can\nspread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which\nare spread when a person with Coronavirus coughs or exhales. These droplets land\non objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch Coronavirus\nby first touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.\nPeople can also catch Coronavirus if they breathe in from a person with Coronavirus\nwho coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than\n1 meter away from a person who is sick.\n\nHEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION - CLASS X\n\n4.

It includes Ahara (Food), Vihara (Relaxation),\nAchara (Conduct), Vichara (Thinking), Vyavahara (Behaviour).\n\nTheories of training are also included in this subject area.\nThese are principles and characteristics of sports training,\nmethods of sports training, training load, warming up,\ncooling down, aerobic and anaerobic activities, calisthenics\nand rhythmic exercises, specific training program for\ndevelopment of various motor qualities, techniques, tactics\nand talent identification. It is also important to understand\nthe difference between play, games and sports.\n\nPLay, GAMES AND SPORT\n\nThough these terms are used interchangeably, these are\nactually different.\n\nPlay\n\nPlay is spontaneous. It is usually a creative activity but has\nits own limitation and space. One plays voluntarily for fun\nand pleasure. Play, however, is a broad area which includes\nboth games and sports. The distinctive features of play are\nthat they are free, separate, uncertain, governed by self rules\nand creative.\n\nGames\n\nGenerally the word games and sports are used together.\nA game is an activity involving more players, defined by a goal\nthat the players tries to reach, and some set rules to play.\nBy masses, games are played primarily for entertainment\nor enjoyment. The difference of purpose differentiates sport\nfrom game, combined with the notion of individual or team\nskill. Games are also played on the basis of a set of rules.\nA game is defined as a goal that the players try to achieve. A\nperson who participates in a game is known as a player.\n\nSport\n\nA sport is a physical activity carried out under an agreed set\nof rules, for competition or self-enjoyment or a combination\nof these. Sport are the kind of activities in which similar\nkind of body movement is repeated over a long time. For\nexample, swimming and running and almost all the track\nand field events come under sport. Sport involves an activity\nor activities where the mental capabilities of the sportsperson\nare judged. In a sport, it is the sportsperson or the individual\nwho determines the outcome. A person participating in a\nsport is called an athlete or a sportsperson.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe teacher divides\nstudents into small groups\nof 10 and plans an aerobic\ndance or drama. Keeping\nin view the skill, creativity,\nand music, these may\neven be in the form of a\ncompetition.\n\n5\n\nSLOdraNS YAHLO HLM dIHSNOLLVTag] -NOLLVONGY TWOISAHG\n\n8/28/2020 4:45:57 PM\n\n\nRELATIONSHIP OF HEALTH AND PHYSICAL\nEDUCATION WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES OF\nKNOWLEDGE\n\nHealth and Physical Education (HPE) classes provide space\nfor exploring new ideas related to personal and community\nhealth. These ideas might then be used by students in various\nother fields of learning, such as, arts, science, civics and\ncitizenship, communication, design, creativity and technology\nand languages (english, hindi and other regional languages),\nhumanities (e.g. history, geography, economics, etc.),\ninformation and communication technology and psychology.\n\nArt\n\nHealth and physical education teachers can incorporate\nactivities related to performing arts, drawing, painting,\ndance, drama, media, music and visual communication into\ntheir programs. These involve both fine motor skills and\nwhole body movement including rhythmic movement. As\nbody movements are part of both arts practice and health\nand physical education, these promote health knowledge,\nunderstanding of the body and lead to physical fitness and\nenhancing of creative skills at the same time.\n\nScience\n\nThe human body is a common concern of both science and\nhealth and physical education. In science, students study the\nhuman body from the cellular level to the systems level, with\na focus on anatomy and physiology. In health and physical\neducation learning is focused on the requirements for good\nhealth and the promotion of a healthy body. Students gain\nan understanding of the role of physical and yogic activities\nin ensuring good health and can link the functioning of the\nmusculo-skeletal, digestive, endocrine and nervous systems\nstudied in science, for the promotion of the physical, social,\nmental and emotional health of individuals within a society.\nStudents consider it their personal responsibilities to discuss\nand adopt health issues, both in relation to their own safety\nand well-being, as well as to the safety and well-being of\nothers. It also contributes in the designing of training for\nmovements of organs to achieve optimal performance in the\narea of play, sports and games.\n\nHEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION - CLASS X\n\n6\n\nSocial science\n\nSocial sciences promote the idea that citizens require\nknowledge and understanding of civic institutions and the\nskills and willingness to actively participate in functioning\nof the society. Similarly, in health and physical education,\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-1.indd 6 8/28/2020 4:45:57 PM\n\n\nChap-1.indd 7\n\nstudents are encouraged to become active and responsible\nmembers of their community. Key concepts within health\nand physical education classes include understanding of\nthe importance of personal identity within a community,\nwhat makes a community and how to engage with different\nmembers and agencies within a community. Participation in\nphysical activity and sports also reflect values, rules, rights\nand responsibilities indicative of a democratic society.\n\nCommunication\n\nCommunication involves developing knowledge, skills and\nbehaviors that empower students to respond to, make meaning\nof, and deconstruct a range of communication forms. Effective\ncommunication is a key skillin health and physical education.\nIt is essential that students develop the ability to listen, view\nand respond with respect to the content and context in which\ncommunication happens. Learning in the health and physical\neducation domain involves developing familiarity with forms,\nlanguage and conventions used in different forms of public,\npersonal and interpersonal communication.\n\nDesign, Creativity and Technology\n\nDesign, Creativity and Technology (DCT) help in developing\nsport goods, sportwear, sport software programme, etc.\nThese are associated with knowledge and promotion. In\nthis area students learn about the characteristic and\nproperties of how all these aspects differ from each other.\nThese investigations assist students to make decisions about\nappropriate solution. Students analyse and evaluate factors,\nsuch as, social, cultural and economic factors that influence\ndesign, creativity and technology.\n\nLanguage(s)\n\nLanguages help students to develop critical approaches to\nthe ideas and thoughts collated to read, view, write, compare,\nresearch and talk about texts. Health and Physical Education\nteachers can use examples related to health and wellbeing\nto encourage students to reflect on their lifestyles and\nanalyse ways by which the media influences their attitude\ntowards health. For example, Health and Physical Education\nemphasises on the importance of physical fitness, self-esteem\nand body image in the maintenance of good health.\n\nEconomics\n\nEconomics is the study of how society allocates scarce\nresources to satisfy the wants and needs of its members.\nWithin the health and physical education (HPE) context,\nconsumer health assists students to become more\ninformed consumers of health products and services.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nIdentify and analyse\nhealth needs and\nservices available in\nthe community.\n\nInvestigate the cost of\nspecific behaviours,\nillness or disease in\nthe community, such\nas, the economic\nimpact of obesity and\ninactivity on society.\nExplore the influence\nof government\nspending on health\noutcomes for\nindividuals and the\ncommunity.\n\nIdentify various\nlocations from the map\nand interpret maps\n\nfor outdoor adventure\nactivities.\n\nInvestigate the impact\nof development and\nglobalisation on\npoverty, the links\nbetween food, hunger\nand technology,\nidentifying and locating\nfacilities and services\nthat contribute to the\nhealth and safety of\ncommunities on a local\nand national level.\n\nNX)\n\nSLOdraNS YAHLO HLM dIHSNOLLVTag] -NOLLVONGY TWOISAHG\n\n8/28/2020 4:45:57 PM\n\n\nThe cost of disease emerging from unhealthy lifestyle is\nalso studied to determine the burden of disease on families\nand community.\n\nGeography\nStudents develop skills in reading and interpreting maps of\ndifferent kinds and at different scales. The same knowledge and\nskills are reinforced in physical education during orientation\n° Create a report and on outdoor education activities (Trekking, Mountaineering,\nmay be a presentation etc).

These are associated with their own specific\nlanguages, vocabularies and discourses. Different societies have\ndifferent attitudes, values and beliefs about physical activities\nwhich are expressed in their regional languages.\n\nMytTuHs AND MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT PHYSICAL\n\nEDUCATION\n\nMyths are surrounded in regard to relationship of physical\neducation with academic success. One of the most discussed\nmyths in the society is that participation in sport and games\nreduces academic performance of individual.\n\nMyths\n\nParticipation in sport kills the time of study. Contrary to the\nwidely held assumption that sport and other activities cut upon\nthe time for serious school study, research evidence has shown\nthat students tend to do better in school when they participate\nin physical activities. There is a positive correlation between\nperformance in sport and the level of academic achievement.\nPhysical education including sport is an integral part of the\nsocial and cultural infrastructure of a nation. It really can\nmake a difference in the broader educational process and in\nchanging and enhancing the quality of life. Vigorous physical\nexercise stimulates circulation, helps prevent skin eruptions\nand increases fluid intake. These exercises also promote\nself-worth and mental health, and support an individual for\nhealing an injury. Sport also enhances physical performance\nand induce positive physiological adaptation. When children\nexercise, their fitness needs are met, and build up energy\nto learn and achieve. Given the growing number of children\nwith obesity, watching TV, continuously being involved in\ncomputer games and other unwanted activities, frequency\nof the children getting involved in physical achievement\nand academic performance, has taken a back seat. Physical\nexercise enhances the function in joints, increases the sense\nof physical well being and promotes a sense of feeling good. It\nalso increases physical working capacity by increasing cardio-\nrespiratory fitness and increased strength and endurance\nand decreases risk of serious disease that could lead to early\ndisability and death.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\ne Identify, collect and\nevaluate data from\nonline sources, such\nas, blogs, websites\nand forums to inform\nabout myths related to\nPhysical Education.\n\n9\n\nSLOdraNS YAHLO HLM dIHSNOLLVTag] -NOLLVONGY TWOISAHG\n\n8/28/2020 4:45:57 PM\n\n\nHEALTH AND PHysICAL EDUCATION - CLASS X\n\n10\n\n| Chap-1.indd 10\n\n.

What are the symptoms?\n\nThe most common symptoms of Coronavirus are fever, cough and difficulty in breathing.\nSome patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or\ndiarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become\ninfected but don’t develop any symptoms and dont’t feel unwell. Most people (about\n80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. People with fever\ncough and difficulty in breathing should seek medical attention immediately.\n\n3. How does Coronavirus spread?\n\nPeople can catch Coronavirus from others who have the virus. The disease can\nspread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which\nare spread when a person with Coronavirus coughs or exhales. These droplets land\non objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch Coronavirus\nby first touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.\nPeople can also catch Coronavirus if they breathe in from a person with Coronavirus\nwho coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than\n1 meter away from a person who is sick.\n\nHEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION - CLASS X\n\n4.

It is usually a creative activity but has\nits own limitation and space. One plays voluntarily for fun\nand pleasure. Play, however, is a broad area which includes\nboth games and sports. The distinctive features of play are\nthat they are free, separate, uncertain, governed by self rules\nand creative.\n\nGames\n\nGenerally the word games and sports are used together.\nA game is an activity involving more players, defined by a goal\nthat the players tries to reach, and some set rules to play.\nBy masses, games are played primarily for entertainment\nor enjoyment. The difference of purpose differentiates sport\nfrom game, combined with the notion of individual or team\nskill. Games are also played on the basis of a set of rules.\nA game is defined as a goal that the players try to achieve. A\nperson who participates in a game is known as a player.\n\nSport\n\nA sport is a physical activity carried out under an agreed set\nof rules, for competition or self-enjoyment or a combination\nof these. Sport are the kind of activities in which similar\nkind of body movement is repeated over a long time. For\nexample, swimming and running and almost all the track\nand field events come under sport. Sport involves an activity\nor activities where the mental capabilities of the sportsperson\nare judged. In a sport, it is the sportsperson or the individual\nwho determines the outcome. A person participating in a\nsport is called an athlete or a sportsperson.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe teacher divides\nstudents into small groups\nof 10 and plans an aerobic\ndance or drama.

In science, students study the\nhuman body from the cellular level to the systems level, with\na focus on anatomy and physiology. In health and physical\neducation learning is focused on the requirements for good\nhealth and the promotion of a healthy body. Students gain\nan understanding of the role of physical and yogic activities\nin ensuring good health and can link the functioning of the\nmusculo-skeletal, digestive, endocrine and nervous systems\nstudied in science, for the promotion of the physical, social,\nmental and emotional health of individuals within a society.\nStudents consider it their personal responsibilities to discuss\nand adopt health issues, both in relation to their own safety\nand well-being, as well as to the safety and well-being of\nothers.

You are aware that a healthy\nindividual is one who has a healthy mind in a healthy body.\nThis state of health can be achieved when various organ\nsystems of the body function in harmony. For example,\nphysical activities are based on motor movements and their\nco-ordination. The command for movements comes from the\nbrain which is a part of the nervous system. The required\nenergy for movements and other activities is obtained from\nfood. Food is completely digested in the intestine, a part of\ndigestive system. Food and oxygen reach all the parts of body\nthrough the action of heart, which is a part of the circulatory\nsystem. In fact, many organ systems of the body function as\nan integrated whole for healthy maintenance of the body.\n\nYou have already studied about organ systems of the\nhuman body in the previous science classes. In this chapter,\nthe organ systems have been discussed in relation to the\neffect of physical activities. It is a common experience that\nperformance in any event, sports or otherwise, depends\nupon physical health, as well as, mental and emotional\nhealth. Development and maintenance of physical, mental\nand emotional health specially during this coronavirus\n(COVID-19) is therefore, very important.\n\nOrGAN SYSTEMS oF Human Bopy\n\nAggregates of cells constitute a tissue. Tissues of various kinds\ntogether make an organ and many organs together comprise\nan organ system. Various organ systems perform different\nfunctions of the body necessary for wellbeing and healthy living.\nThe organs which have a major role to play in the functioning of\ntheir respective system, such as, heart, lungs, liver and kidney\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n1077CHO2\n\n8/24/2020 1:09:23 PM\n\n\nare called vital organs. Before we learn about the impact of\nphysical activities on organ systems, let us review functioning\nof these systems.\n\nOrgan systems for movement of body and limbs:\nskeletal and muscular systems\n\nWhen you walk, play, exercise, practice or participate in a\nsport, or even when you ‘warm up’ prior to a sport activity\nor competition, what is most obvious are the movements\nof hands and legs, with the brain being equally active.\nAll the movements are due to contraction of muscles. Muscles\nare attached to bones. Bones form the skeleton. Bones are\nattached to each other by ligaments and muscles are attached\nto bones by tendons (Fig. 2.1, 2.2, 2.3).\n\nFig. 2.1: Muscle movement Fig. 2.2: Muscle of the arm Fig. 2.3: Human skeleton\n\na\ng\ns\nOo\nzZ\no\n&\n=)\nQ\nca)\n4\ng\nn\n;\nA,\nQ\nz\nE\n5\n.\n\nSmooth muscle Cardiac muscle\n\nFig. 2.4: Types of muscles\n\n17 ll\n\nvepea\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-2.indd 12 8/24/2020 1:09:25 PM\n\n\nMuscles are made up of muscle cells which are also\ntermed as muscle fibres because of their elongated shape.\nYou have learnt in earlier classes that there are mainly three\nkinds of muscles. There are muscles that contract to cause\nmovements according to one’s will. These are called voluntary\nmuscles, such as, those of the limbs and the neck. The\ninvoluntary muscles, such as, those lining the food canal,\nmove automatically without our efforts for making them move.\nAnother kind of muscles, which are also involuntary, are the\nmuscles of the heart or cardiac muscles which never stop\ncontracting and relaxing. As learnt in earlier classes, muscle\ncells (muscle fibres) may be striated (voluntary) muscle fibres,\nunstriated (involuntary) muscle fibres and cardiac muscle pgqerline the labelled\nfibres (Fig.2.4). Muscles are grouped into bundles enclosedina__ vital organs in Fig. 2.5\nmembrane.

Upon receiving instructions from the brain\nand nerves, these proteins slide over each other and the muscle\ncontracts. Muscle contraction uses up energy, which comes\nfrom food. It is measured in calories.\n\nEnergy producing organ systems Sketual vette,\n\nThrough digestive system, food gets digested and\nconverted to a form, which can be broken down\nin the cell to release energy. Respiratory system\nensures a continuous supply of Oxygen to each and\nevery cell of the body for oxidation of food.

It passes through nostrils, pharynx, trachea and\nbronchi and reaches the lungs (inhalation). The reverse\nhappens during exhalation when muscles of the rib cage\nand diaphragm relax and CO, laden air from lungs goes out\nthrough bronchi, trachea and nostrils.\n\nBreathing is followed by internal respiration when oxygen\nladen air from alveoli or air sacks of lungs is picked up by\ncapillaries and reaches the heart through pulmonary vein.\nOnce oxygen reaches cells, it oxidises glucose (which reaches\ncells after digestion through blood) to release energy as ATP\nor adenosine tri phosphate.\n\nCirculatory system circulates nutrients and oxygen to all\nparts of the body.

As the heart beats, oxygenated blood flows\ninto the arteries and goes to various parts of the body, and\nthen it flows back to the heart through veins for oxygenation\nin the lungs. This circulation of blood is depicted below.\nBlood flow between heart and lungs is called pulmonary\ncirculation, while between heart and body parts is called\nsystemic circulation.\n\nThe process of circulation is shown in Fig 2.10 and further\nelaborated below.\n\nDeoxygenated ;\nblood from all ——» Right Left <—\nparts of the body <a <a\ny ’\nRight Left\n\nTo lungs for\n\n. «—— Ventricle | Ventricle\noxygenation\n\nOxygenated blood to all parts of body\n\nFig. 2.9: Diagrammatic representation of the heart and the flow of blood\nthrough it\n\nAs shown in the above figure\n\n¢ Deoxygenated blood from all parts of the body is collected\nby the veins.

You are aware that a healthy\nindividual is one who has a healthy mind in a healthy body.\nThis state of health can be achieved when various organ\nsystems of the body function in harmony. For example,\nphysical activities are based on motor movements and their\nco-ordination. The command for movements comes from the\nbrain which is a part of the nervous system. The required\nenergy for movements and other activities is obtained from\nfood. Food is completely digested in the intestine, a part of\ndigestive system. Food and oxygen reach all the parts of body\nthrough the action of heart, which is a part of the circulatory\nsystem. In fact, many organ systems of the body function as\nan integrated whole for healthy maintenance of the body.\n\nYou have already studied about organ systems of the\nhuman body in the previous science classes. In this chapter,\nthe organ systems have been discussed in relation to the\neffect of physical activities. It is a common experience that\nperformance in any event, sports or otherwise, depends\nupon physical health, as well as, mental and emotional\nhealth.

This chapter deals with key aspects and issues\nrelated to the period of adolescence.\n\nGROWING UP DURING ADOLESCENCE\nLife cycle begins at birth.

It is an\nincrease in secretion of sex hormones (testosterone in males,\nestrogen and progesterone in females). Puberty merges into\nadolescence at around 10 years of age, and adolescence\ngenerally lasts till 19 years of age. You may recall the\ndiscussion on adolescence in the chapters of your Class VIII\ntextbook of science and the Class IX textbook of Health and\nPhysical Education.\n\nDuring this phase, significant physical and psychological\nchanges take place. However, as you have already learnt in\nyour previous classes, the timing of these changes varies\nwith every individual.\n\nUnique features of adolescence\nThe two unique features of adolescence are —\n\n(i) The spurt in physical growth, when a physical\nappearance of an individual gradually becomes\ndifferent. This is due to the rapid acceleration in\ngrowth of skeletal tissue (bones and cartilage) and\nmuscular and glandular tissue. For examples, breasts\nbegin to develop in girls due to the release of estrogen\nhormone. Changes in voice are quite noticeable\namong boys.\n\n*\nQ\ns\n\n\\)\nZz\niS)\nE\nS\n5\na\n\nca\n<\ng\na\nFe\n\n4\na\n2\n:\na]\n\nan)\n\n(ii) It is a time period between the onset of puberty and\nadulthood.\n\nGrowth spurt in adolescents\n\nAs you would have experienced yourself, the changes during\nadolescence occur speedily and alter the body size and shape\nof adolescents. Suddenly the child seems to have grown up\ninto a young adult. This is called growth spurt and is shown\nthrough the following flow chart.\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-3.indd 24 8/24/2020 4:15:38 PM\n\n\nChap-3.indd 25\n\nOrgans of the Circulatory system\n\nv y\nDifferences in Development\nstructure of towards\nmales and females maturity of\nin body size and genitals\nstructure\nVv\nDevelopment of\nDevelopment of attraction towards\nsecondary sexual opposite sex and\ncharacter maturation of\nsocial behavior\n\nCHANGES IN Bopy SIZE AND STRUCTURE\n\nUnder the influence of growth hormone, the body size\nincreases. Sex hormones stimulate growth and maturity of\ngonads (reproductive organs). Inmales, testes growin size and\nstart producing sperms. In females, the eggs or ova present\nin the ovary since birth begins to mature. Sex organs also\nincrease in size. Thus, there is an overall growth in body size.\nAs sexual maturity progresses during adolescence, hormones\nact on growth centers of bones which are responsible for\nincrease in length of bones. The long bones, the vertebrae\nand limbs grow and the adolescent gains height. The limbs\nbecome stronger. The heart, lungs and other internal organs\nalso grow to match the increase in body size. The muscle\nmass undergoes a spurt at adolescence. Eventually, growth\nrate slows down and then stops. Generally, at the age of 14\nto 18 years of age, adult height is already reached. The peak\nof growth of muscle mass is also typically around the age of\n14 to 16 years. In the females, the pelvis region undergoes a\ngrowth spurt and becomes wider.\n\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS\n\nIn earlier classes, you have learnt about secondary sexual\ncharacteristics. As a result of physical changes, secondary\nsexual characteristics begin to develop in both girls and\nboys. Some characteristics are related to girls; some to boys\nand some are common for both. You may understand this\ndevelopment better by conducting Activity 3.1.\n\nIdentify the secondary sexual characteristics of adolescence during\n10 to 19 years in the given table.

Wet dreams is a discharge of semen\n(seminal fluid) containing sperms. Many adolescent boys are\nusually not aware of this phenomenon and get worried when\nthey face this situation first time.\n\nSemen is the fluid formed by glands associated with male\nreproductive system. Semen carries mature sperms formed\nin the testes.\n\nRead the following case studies which confirm the\nuniqueness of every individual with regard to time of\noccurrence of changes during adolescence.\n\nCASE 1: My father calls me ‘Sher’\n\nRakesh and Dibang, students of Class IX, are walking home\ntogether from school. Rakesh begins to tease Dibang, saying\nthat he speaks in a girl’s voice. He also laughs at the fact\nthat Dibang has got no hair on his upper lip. “Look at me,”\nRakesh says, “I am a real man. My voice is strong and my\nface is manly - I have so much facial hair. My father calls me\nsher.” Dibang wonders what is wrong with him. He recalls\nthat his mother still calls him ‘my sweet boy’. He decides\nto go home and ask his mother why he is so different from\nRakesh and whether something is wrong with him.\n\n*\nB\ns\n\\)\nZz\niS)\nE\nS\n5\na\nca\n<\ng\na\nFe\n4\na\n2\n:\na]\nan)\n\nPoints for Discussion\n\na) What do you think Dibang felt with Rakesh’s remarks?\n\nb) Do you think that there is something wrong with\nDibang?

They have so much to talk about, a new film, a\nnew dress, home work, the boys in the class and just about\neverything.\n\nYesterday, Radha seemed uncomfortable. She was\nhaving her periods and was concerned about staining her\nuniform. Last month, Sujatha’s family had organised a big\ncelebration in her honour as she had started her periods.\nPooja recalled that three months ago, Abida had started her\nperiods in school and had to borrow a sanitary napkin from\nher older cousin. Except Pooja, all her friends have started\ntheir periods.

When Naresh who is Suresh’s\nbest friend first experienced wet dream, he confided in\nSuresh. Suresh encouraged Naresh to visit the nearest\nHealth Centre to have a discussion about wet dream with\nthe doctor.\n\nPoints for Discussion\n\na) Do you think something is wrong with Naresh?\n\nb) According to you, the advice given by Suresh is\ncorrect or not?\n\nc) What are the myths associated with wet dream?\n\nd) What advice was given by the doctor to Naresh?\n\ne Adolescence is a period of physical and emotional\nchanges which are triggered by a set of hormones.\nThese changes are part of growing up.\n\ne These changes occur at different times for different\nindividuals.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n2\n3\nfen)\n2\n0\n;\n:\neo)\n'U\nES\n@\n4\nie)\nc\ng\nZ\nQ\nS\n=\nigh\nDM\neo)\nil\n2\neo)\nic)\n\n8/24/2020 4:15:39 PM\n\n\nHEALTH AND PuysicAL Epucation - CLass X\n\n| Chap-3.indd 28\n\ne You should not compare your physical changes with\nothers — the pace at which changes take place differ\nfrom person to person.\n\ne Itis natural to feel awkward or conscious of the changes\nthat occur but try to support each other by accepting\nthese as part of a natural process and don’t let these\ndecrease your self-confidence.\n\ne If you have any doubts or concerns about changes that\nare occurring to you reach out to a trusted adult or\nyou can talk to a counsellor in the adolescent friendly\nHealth Clinic near where you live.\n\ne Many young boys due to feeling of shame visit quacks\nand waste lot of time and money. It is best to visit the\ndoctor or the health centre. One can discuss the myths\nrelated to growing up with a trusted person (teacher,\nparents, friends).\n\ne There is a myth that wet dream causes weakness among\nthe males because semen is lost from the body. However\nit is not so, semen and sperms are continuously made\nin the testes and semen lost during wet dream gets\nreplaced very soon.\n\nMENSTRUATION\n\nThe first menstruation is termed as menarche. In India, age\nof menarche is 12-13 years but may vary from individual to\nindividual. Menstruation generally stops between the age of\n45 and 55 years and is termed as menopause. Menopausal age\nvaries in different individuals. Age of menarche has decreased\ndue to various lifestyle changes. Menstruation hygiene and\ncleanliness is very important. Points to remember —\n¢ Regular bath and washing self properly are important\nfor avoiding infections, especially during menstruation.\ne Change undergarment regularly (at least once a day)\nand avoid synthetic cloth.\ne During menstruation, cloth, cloth pads or napkins should\nbe changed after every four to six hours to avoid infection.\ne One can also use sanitary napkins to manage\nmenstrual hygiene. Many girls and women also make\nsanitary napkins at home with old cloth and cotton. If\none makes a sanitary napkin at home, use only clean,\nsoft cotton cloth. Do not use old cloth that may have\nany metal or plastic parts in it like glitter, gota or hooks\nand buttons. This may hurt or cause infection.\n¢ If a cloth is used again as pad, it should be washed\nthoroughly with soap and dried in sun before next use\nas sunlight is an excellent disinfectant. Do not use dirty\nor damp cloth as it causes infections.\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n8/24/2020 4:15:39 PM\n\n\nChap-3.indd 29\n\ne Child With Special Need (CWSN) should be shown the\nprocess of maintaining hygiene or explained in detail\nif necessary.\n\ne Sanitary pads should be wrapped in paper and disposed\nin trash bins or buried deep in a pit. Some schools have\nIncinerators which offer another safe way to dispose\nsanitary pads. There should be no shame attached in\nthe process of disposing sanitary pads.\n\nGovernment is supporting schemes for promoting menstrual\nhygiene among adolescent girls (10-19 years). Sanitary\nnapkins are made available in schools or by ASHAs at a\nsubsidised rate.\n\nPsyCHOSOCIAL CHANGES DURING ADOLESCENCE\n\nPsychosocial changes mean changes in thoughts, mood,\nattractions and friendships. The word ‘social’ is associated\nwith the word ‘society’. As adolescence sets in, a boy or girl\nbecomes psychologically aware of self and society. As aresult,\nthe adolescents build their own image and personality. This\ngives confidence to the adolescent to move in the society.\n\nAdolescence is a transitional phase between childhood and\nadulthood. During this transitional period the adolescents\nget confused regarding their emerging role in the family\nand society at large. The physical changes in adolescents\nare accompanied by psychosocial changes. Adolescents get\nattracted towards opposite sex or become part of a peer\ngroup. Such changes tend to make them more dependent on\nthe peer group in neighborhood, among classmates, etc. This\noften creates stressful relationships with parents, teachers\nand elders. Sometimes these developments may make them\ninsecure about future. Adolescents who become aware of\nthese changes, overcome this phase comfortably.\n\nThe social changes are reflected in the behavior of\nadolescents with peers and parents. They differ from parents\non many issues and develop the confidence to express\ntheir own opinion emphatically if parents are friendly and\nunderstanding. Adolescents are more friendly with their\npeer group. However belonging to a vulnerable age group,\nadolescents may feel pressurised under the influence of\npeers. Everyone feels the need to have friends but during\nadolescence the need for friendship is more pronounced.\nThe friendship may be with a peer or relative of one’s own\nage and someone of own sex or the other sex. It is, therefore,\nimportant for them to identify with whom they can share\ntheir ideas and identify ‘safety net’ in friends, parents and\nteachers.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSome psychological\nchanges that occur in an\nadolescent are mentioned\n\nhere.

However, the\nreproductive maturity is reached only when a teenager is fully\ndeveloped physically and physiologically. In India, because\nof early marriage, there are large number of adolescents or\nteenage pregnancies. If pregnancy occurs before reaching\ncomplete reproductive maturity, girls may risk their own\nhealth and that of the fetus (developing embryo).\n\nRisks involved in adolescent pregnancy are mentioned\nbelow —\n\ne An adolescent mother is not mentally prepared for\n\nmotherhood.\n\ne An adolescent mother is likely to be anemic.\n\ne An adolescent mother is more prone towards maternal\ndeath while giving birth.\n\ne Infant death are more among teenage mothers.\n\ne There is likelihood of developing complications during\ngiving birth.\n\ne The baby born from teenage mother requires greater\ncare which the teenage mother may not be able to give.\n\ne The reproductive tract may be damaged during\nchildbirth.\n\ne Early pregnancy and motherhood delays development\nof education and career of adolescent mother.\n\ne There may be economic problems and also problems\ndue to psychological immaturity of the adolescent\nmother. This may hamper proper care of the infant.\n\nRead the case study given below. Think and answer the questions\nthat follow.\n\nRahul’s grandmother and Sangeeta’s grandmother were great\nfriends.

While you must maintain hygiene of all\nexternal parts, the internal organs also have to function\nnormally. You know that certain vital functions of the body\nfor enjoying good health are maintenance of blood pressure,\npulse rate, respiratory rate, etc. Some ways of assessing\nthe vital functions and statistics of human beings are\ngiven below.\n\nBlood pressure (BP) and its measurement\nPressure exerted\nby blood on the\n\nwall of the arteries\nis called blood\n\npressure. When\n\nthe heart\n\ncontracts, blood\n\nsurges through\n\naorta, BP is ,\n\nhighest (Systolic Fig. 3.1: Checking blood pressure\n\nPressure) pressure\nof blood on the arterial wall recorded when ventricles relax is\nlowest (Diastolic Pressure).\n\nThe pressure wave\nalong the arteries with\neach heartbeat can be\nfelt at the pulse. Blood\npressure is measured\n\nby the instrument\ncalled “Sphygmoma-\nnometer”. Diastolic\n\nand Systolic pressure\nis measured and ina\nnormal healthy young\nadult it is 110/75,\nwhich means 110\nmm Hg systolic and\n75 mm Hg diastolic.\nSphygmomanometer\nconsists of cuff with\nan inflatable bladder which is wrapped around a person’s up-\nper arm and a rubber bulb inflates the bladder. An attached\ndevice indicates the blood pressure. There is now a digital de-\nvice which is also used for measuring the BP. BP increases\nwith age to about 130/90mm Hg. Abnormally high BP is called\nhypertension.\n\nFig. 3.3: Sphygmomanometer\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nmid-arm\n\nMeasuring\nCircumference\n\nBiceps is the muscle of\nmid arm.\n\nPlace the beginning of the\ntapes in the middle of the\nbiceps (midway between\nshoulder and elbow joint)\ntake the reading and\nrecord it.

It is an\nincrease in secretion of sex hormones (testosterone in males,\nestrogen and progesterone in females). Puberty merges into\nadolescence at around 10 years of age, and adolescence\ngenerally lasts till 19 years of age. You may recall the\ndiscussion on adolescence in the chapters of your Class VIII\ntextbook of science and the Class IX textbook of Health and\nPhysical Education.\n\nDuring this phase, significant physical and psychological\nchanges take place. However, as you have already learnt in\nyour previous classes, the timing of these changes varies\nwith every individual.\n\nUnique features of adolescence\nThe two unique features of adolescence are —\n\n(i) The spurt in physical growth, when a physical\nappearance of an individual gradually becomes\ndifferent. This is due to the rapid acceleration in\ngrowth of skeletal tissue (bones and cartilage) and\nmuscular and glandular tissue. For examples, breasts\nbegin to develop in girls due to the release of estrogen\nhormone. Changes in voice are quite noticeable\namong boys.\n\n*\nQ\ns\n\n\\)\nZz\niS)\nE\nS\n5\na\n\nca\n<\ng\na\nFe\n\n4\na\n2\n:\na]\n\nan)\n\n(ii) It is a time period between the onset of puberty and\nadulthood.\n\nGrowth spurt in adolescents\n\nAs you would have experienced yourself, the changes during\nadolescence occur speedily and alter the body size and shape\nof adolescents. Suddenly the child seems to have grown up\ninto a young adult. This is called growth spurt and is shown\nthrough the following flow chart.\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-3.indd 24 8/24/2020 4:15:38 PM\n",

Sex hormones stimulate growth and maturity of\ngonads (reproductive organs). Inmales, testes growin size and\nstart producing sperms. In females, the eggs or ova present\nin the ovary since birth begins to mature. Sex organs also\nincrease in size. Thus, there is an overall growth in body size.\nAs sexual maturity progresses during adolescence, hormones\nact on growth centers of bones which are responsible for\nincrease in length of bones. The long bones, the vertebrae\nand limbs grow and the adolescent gains height. The limbs\nbecome stronger. The heart, lungs and other internal organs\nalso grow to match the increase in body size. The muscle\nmass undergoes a spurt at adolescence. Eventually, growth\nrate slows down and then stops. Generally, at the age of 14\nto 18 years of age, adult height is already reached. The peak\nof growth of muscle mass is also typically around the age of\n14 to 16 years. In the females, the pelvis region undergoes a\ngrowth spurt and becomes wider.\n\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS\n\nIn earlier classes, you have learnt about secondary sexual\ncharacteristics. As a result of physical changes, secondary\nsexual characteristics begin to develop in both girls and\nboys. Some characteristics are related to girls; some to boys\nand some are common for both. You may understand this\ndevelopment better by conducting Activity 3.1.\n\nIdentify the secondary sexual characteristics of adolescence during\n10 to 19 years in the given table.

In India, age\nof menarche is 12-13 years but may vary from individual to\nindividual. Menstruation generally stops between the age of\n45 and 55 years and is termed as menopause. Menopausal age\nvaries in different individuals. Age of menarche has decreased\ndue to various lifestyle changes. Menstruation hygiene and\ncleanliness is very important. Points to remember —\n¢ Regular bath and washing self properly are important\nfor avoiding infections, especially during menstruation.\ne Change undergarment regularly (at least once a day)\nand avoid synthetic cloth.\ne During menstruation, cloth, cloth pads or napkins should\nbe changed after every four to six hours to avoid infection.\ne One can also use sanitary napkins to manage\nmenstrual hygiene. Many girls and women also make\nsanitary napkins at home with old cloth and cotton. If\none makes a sanitary napkin at home, use only clean,\nsoft cotton cloth. Do not use old cloth that may have\nany metal or plastic parts in it like glitter, gota or hooks\nand buttons. This may hurt or cause infection.\n¢ If a cloth is used again as pad, it should be washed\nthoroughly with soap and dried in sun before next use\nas sunlight is an excellent disinfectant. Do not use dirty\nor damp cloth as it causes infections.\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n8/24/2020 4:15:39 PM\n",

The word ‘social’ is associated\nwith the word ‘society’. As adolescence sets in, a boy or girl\nbecomes psychologically aware of self and society. As aresult,\nthe adolescents build their own image and personality. This\ngives confidence to the adolescent to move in the society.\n\nAdolescence is a transitional phase between childhood and\nadulthood. During this transitional period the adolescents\nget confused regarding their emerging role in the family\nand society at large. The physical changes in adolescents\nare accompanied by psychosocial changes. Adolescents get\nattracted towards opposite sex or become part of a peer\ngroup. Such changes tend to make them more dependent on\nthe peer group in neighborhood, among classmates, etc. This\noften creates stressful relationships with parents, teachers\nand elders. Sometimes these developments may make them\ninsecure about future. Adolescents who become aware of\nthese changes, overcome this phase comfortably.\n\nThe social changes are reflected in the behavior of\nadolescents with peers and parents. They differ from parents\non many issues and develop the confidence to express\ntheir own opinion emphatically if parents are friendly and\nunderstanding. Adolescents are more friendly with their\npeer group. However belonging to a vulnerable age group,\nadolescents may feel pressurised under the influence of\npeers. Everyone feels the need to have friends but during\nadolescence the need for friendship is more pronounced.\nThe friendship may be with a peer or relative of one’s own\nage and someone of own sex or the other sex. It is, therefore,\nimportant for them to identify with whom they can share\ntheir ideas and identify ‘safety net’ in friends, parents and\nteachers.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSome psychological\nchanges that occur in an\nadolescent are mentioned\n\nhere.

There are two broad categories of competitions\nwhich are played as individual games and team games.\nTeam games are represented by more than two players.\nThe example of team games are Football, Cricket, Hockey,\nBasketball, Volleyball, etc. Individual games are played\nwith different events like, singles events, doubles or mixed iia\nevents.\n\nThere are many individual sports, forexample, Badminton,\nTable Tennis, Tennis, Swimming, Judo, Wrestling, etc. Track\nand field is also an individual sport which we will discuss in ;\nthis chapter.

All running events are held in the track\nand categorised as short distance, middle distance and\nlong distance running, race walk, hurdles and steeplechase\nevents.\n\nField events are categorised as, throwing and jumping\nevents. There are “combined events” which includes decathlon\nfor men and heptathlon for women. Decathlon which is\norganised for men includes 10 events and Heptathlon for\nwomen includes 7 events. The events are described below\nwith the help of Table 4.1.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-4.indd 35 8/24/2020 11:37:16 AM\n\n\nHEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION - CLASS X\n\n| Chap-4.indd 36\n\nTrack (Running Events)\n\n(a)\n\nShort Distance\nRunning Events\n\n100 meter, 200 meter,\n\n400 meter,\n\n110 meter, Hurdles\n(men)\n\n100 meter Hurdles\nfor women\n\n400 meter Hurdles\n(men and women)\n\nTable 4.1: Track and Field Events\nField Events\n\nThrowing Jumping\ne Javelin Throw ¢ High Jump\ne Discus Throw e Long Jump\ne Shot Put ¢ Triple Jump (Hop-step-jump)\n¢ Hammer Throw e Pole Vault\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nMiddle Distance\nRunning Events\n800 meter, 1500\nmeter\n\nLong Distance\nRunning Events\n\nCombined Events\n(a) Decathlon (Men) (consist 10\nevents)\n100 m, Shot put, High Jump,\nLong Jump, 400 m.\n110 m.

Running, jumping and throwing have been\nuniversal forms of human physical activities since the human\nbeings exist. The first recorded example of organised track\nand field events is found in the Ancient Olympic Games\nheld in 776 BC. The starting of the modern Olympic Games\nat Greece in 1896 was marked as new era for track and\nfield events which was initiated by Pierre-de-Coubertin.\nUntil the early 1920s, only males were participating in the\ntrack and field events. Introduction of five track and field events\nfor women in the athletics was started during 1928 Summer\nOlympics. Gradually more women’s events were introduced as\ntime progressed. However, it was only towards the second half\nof the twentieth century that the men’s and women’s track and\nfield events were given equal status. Furthermore, major track\nand field events for disabled athletes were first introduced\nat the 1960 Summer Para Olympics. From 1990’s onwards,\ntrack and field events became increasingly more professional.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n8/24/2020 11:37:17 AM\n\n\nThe World Athletics Federations (WAF) was formed and 200\nnations became its member.

These include track events covering distances\nof 100 meters, 200 meters, 400 meters,\n4x100 meters relay, 4x400 meters\nrelay, and hurdle races of 100 meters\nfor women, 110 meters for men and 400\nmeters for both men and women. At the\nprofessional level, sprinters begin the\nrace by assuming a crouching position on\nthe starting blocks. Then they lean their\nbody forward and gradually move into an\nupright position as the race progresses\nand momentum is gained. Athlete remain\nin the same lane on the running track\nthroughout the sprinting distance. The\nman or woman who runs fastest and takes\nminimum time over 100m, wins the race.\nThe winner is often named ‘the fastest man/woman in the\ncompetition’. Some sprint events start in lanes, to cover the\nsame distance for each runner.\n\nTell the name of different\nstarts in sprint events. Middle distance\n\nHEALTH AND PuysicAL Epucation - CLass X\n\n38\n\nFig. 4.4: Middle distance running\n\nThe middle distance races are of 800 meters and 1500\nmeters. Runners start the race from a standing start position\nin the lanes along a curved starting line or in staggered lanes.\nHowever the distance is same for each runner. After hearing\nthe starter’s pistol, they head forward in the designated lane\nor move towards the innermost track to follow the shortest\nroute to the finish. Athletes rely more on speed endurance and\n\nyepeiri\\\\\\ee\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-4.indd 38 8/24/2020 11:37:19 AM\n\n\nChap-4.indd 39\n\npacing than just pure speed. Middle-distance races require\ndifferent skills and tactics to win the sprints competition.\nThese races require that the athletes maintain a plateau\npace, (i.e. the maintenance of speed at which the runner\nis running) that allows for a final spurt of speed, whereas\nsprint races need to be run at top speed for the entire length\nof the race.\n\nLong distance\n\nThere are four common long distance running events in track and\nfield. These are 3000 meters, 5000 meters and 10,000 meters\nand 3000 meters steeplechase. Long distance track races have\nmuch in common with middle distance races. However, in these\nraces, pacing, endurance, and race tactics play an important\nrole in performance. In these events, runners need to balance\ntheir energy to win the race.\n\nFig. 4.5: Long distance running\n\nRelays\n\nRelay races are the only track events in which a team of\nrunners directly compete against other teams. Common relay\nraces are the 4x 100 meter and the 4x400 meter. The exchange\nof baton takes place within a specified\narea of the track called baton exchange\nzone. Teams may be disqualified if the\nteam fails to complete the baton exchange\nwithin an area of 20 meters, the team is\nconsidered as disqualified. A team may\nalso be disqualified if its runners have\ndeliberately created hurdle for the other\ncompetitors. The 4x100 meter event is\nrun strictly within the same lane on the\ntrack. It means that the team collectively\n\nWhat are important points\nin relays?

For the\nsecond and third baton change-overs, team mates must align\nthemselves in respect of their team position. The leading\nteam takes the inner lanes while team mates of the slower\nteams must await the baton on outer lanes.\n\nThere are 28 hurdle jumps\nand 7 water jumps in 3000\nmeters steeplechase event.\n\nHurdles\n\nFig. 4.7: Hurdles race\n\nTop Edge\nRounded\n\n0.070 me 1.19m+001m\n+ 0.005 m/0.225 m min\n\n0.01 m-—0.025 m\n\n~ f\n\nTt\n\nHEALTH AND PuysicAL Epucation - CLass X\nHeight\n\n40 ©) vy\n\n0.70 m max\n\nFig. 4.8: Dimensions of hurdle\n\nIn this race, hurdles are placed at fixed intervals along the\ntrack. The runners have to run over them on their way to\nfinish the line. Typical hurdle races are the 100m and 400m\nfor women and 110m and 400m for men.

Key rules of\ntrack events relate to three phases — starting, running and\nfinishing.\n\nStarting\n\ne The start of a\nrace is marked\n5 cm wide by a\nwhite line. In all\nraces, that are not\nrun in lanes, the\nstart line must be\ncurved, so that all\nthe athletes run\nthe same distance\nupto the finish.\n\ne Starting blocks shall be used for all races up to and\nincluding 400 meter (including the first lap of the 4x100\nand 4x400) and shall not be used for any other race.\nNo part of the starting block overlaps the start line or\nextend into another lane.\n\nFig. 4.9: Starting position for a\nsprint race\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-4.indd 41\n\nThe details stated above aim\nat making us understand\nabout the different types\nof running.

They have to run in their designated lanes only.\n\nRunning\n\ne In all races that are run in lanes, athletes have keep\nthemselves their allocated lanes from start to finish.\nThis also applies to any portion of a race run in lanes.\n\ne If an athlete leaves the track or steps on the line\ndemarking the track, this will be considered\ndisqualified.\n\ne An athlete, after voluntarily leaving the track shall not\nbe allowed to continue in race.\n\ne Any athlete found intentionally obstructing the path of\nanother runner is also disqualified from the race.\n\ne There are races that start in lanes and then at a “break\nline”, the competitors merge. Examples of this are the\n800 meters and 4x400 relay race.\n\nFinishing\n\ne The finish of a race is marked by a white line 5 cm wide.\nCompetitors are placed in the order in which any part\nof their torso (as distinguished from the head, neck,\narms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of\nthe nearer edge of the finish line.\n\ne The measurement of time shall be taken from the\nflash or the smoke of the gun to the finishing touch,\nwhich shall be recorded in 1/100th of a second if taken\n\nmanually.

These include jumping events\n(Long Jump, Triple Jump, High Jump and Pole Vault) and\nthrowing events (Shot Put, Discus Throw, Javelin Throw and\nHammer Throw).\n\nJumping events\n\nThe jumping events comprise Long Jump, Triple Jump, High\nJump and Pole Vault.\n\n1. Long jump: The long jump is one of the oldest field\nevents. The take-off has to be made from a 20 cm\nwide board one meter away from a pit. Athletes\nsprint along a length of track to a take off board and\na sandpit. If any part of the runner’s foot goes past\nthe takeoff board, the jumper is considered for a foul\nand does not receive score for that round. Distance\nis measured from the end of the takeoff board to the\nnearest mark made by the jumper on the pit. Best\neight competitors have a maximum of six rounds.\nProfessional long jumpers typically have strong\nacceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes\nmust also have a consistent stride to allow them to\ntake off near the board while still maintaining their\nmaximum speed.\n\nJ SLYOdS GNV SHNV*Y) TVNCIAICN]\n\nFig. 4.11: Long jump\n\n2. Triple jump: Similar to the long jump, the triple jump\ntakes place on a field heading towards a sandpit.\nThis event is termed as the “hop-step and jump.”\nThe event begins like a long jump, with competitor\ndashing down the runway and leaping from a takeoff\nboard they first hop then take a step and then jump\ninto the pit. The event is scored identically to the\nlong jump.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-4.indd 43 8/24/2020 11:37:25 AM\n\n\nHop phase Step phase | Jump phase\nFig. 4.12: Triple jump\n\n3. High jump: In high jump event, competitors combined\n\nspeed, to generate lift, with jumping technique.\n\nJumpers may approach the bar from either-side,\n\nPractice and measure and land on a large, generally inflated cushion. In\nseparately hop step and between, they must clear the 4-meter-long bar\n\nJump without knocking it off its supports. The bar will\noriginally be set at a low height, at which competitors\nmay choose to jump, or pass to another height. The\n\nIn case of tie in high jump bar is raised to a predetermined height after each\n\npractice how to break it. round. Each competitor who either clears or passes\n\na height advances to the next round. They are\nranked according to the height they clear. An athlete\nis allowed a maximum of three trials of each height.\nCompetitors are eliminated after missing (failing) three\nconsecutive jumps in a particular height. Athletes\nhave a short run up and then take off from near one\nfoot to jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto\na cushioned landing area. Jumping technique has\nplayed a significant part in the history of the event.\nThe modern technique of high jump as shown in the\nfigure is known as “Fosbury Flop”.\n\n~\ni)\nSs\noO\nZz\nfe\nE\nS\n=\na\nca\n<\nSs\no\n3\nAy\na\nZ\n:\na\n2\n\nFig. 4.13: High jump\n\n4. Pole vault: Each vaulter sprints down the runway with\na fiberglass or carbon fiber pole and plants the pole\ninto the vaulting box. This box is specifically made of\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-4.indd 44 8/24/2020 11:37:32 AM\n\n\nChap-4.indd 45\n\nfiberglass or carbon fiber. The atheletes then push\nthemselves over the crossbar and land onto the mattress.\n\nFig. 4.14: Pole vault\n\nThe rules require that athletes do not move their hands\nalong the pole. As per technique, they begin clearing the bar\nwith their feet first in a position so that the stomach faces\nthe bar. As with high jumping, vaulters may touch the bar,\nas long as it doesn’t fall. Round-by-round scoring rules are\nthe same as for the high jump.\n\nThrowing events\n\nThere are four major throwing events: Shot Put (putting\nthe shot), Discus, Javelin and Hammer Throw. These are\ndetailed below.\n\nFig. 4.15: Shot Put\n\n1. Shot Put: In putting the shot event the athletes put a\nmetal ball through the air for maximum distance. For\nmale athletes, the metal ball weights 7.26 kg and for\nfemale athletes the weight is 4 kg. The athlete must\nstay in acircle of 2.135 m (7 ft) diameter until the shot\nhas landed after throw. The put must be made from the\nshoulder with one arm only, and the shot must not be\nbrought behind the shoulder. In shot put the athlete\nholds the shot close to their neck in one hand. Then\nthey move in straight line or spin around for gaining\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nJ SLYOdS GNV SHNV*Y) TVNCIAICN]\n\n8/24/2020 11:37:35 AM\n\n\nmomentum and finally putting the shot in a pushing\nmanner in the direction of the purified landing area.\n\n2.

Javelin: The javelin is something like a spear. The\nofficial javelin size for women is 2.2 to 2.3 meters\nlong and weights 600 grams. The weight of javelin\nfor men is 800 grams and 2.6 to 2.7 meters long.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-4.indd 46 8/24/2020 11:37:37 AM\n\n\nChap-4.indd 47\n\nThe javelin must be thrown in a specific way for it to be a\nlegal throw. The athlete has to hold the javelin by its grip,\nthrow the javelin overhand and cannot turn the back to\nthe target when throwing. When throwing the javelin,\nthe athlete runs down a runway to gain momentum and\nthen must throw the javelin prior to crossing a line. The\nathlete cannot go over the line until the javelin lands. To\navoid foul, the athlete must have a really good balance at\nthe end of the throw. The athlete must leave the runway\nfrom behind the extended lines of the throwing arc.\n\nFig. 4.18: Hammer throw\n\n4. Hammer Throw: The hammer throw doesn’t actually\ninvolve throwing a hammer like you would think.\nIn this throwing event the athletes throw a heavy\nball (7.265 Kg for men and 4 Kg for women) that is\nattached to a handle with a long (4 feet) wire. Like the\ndiscus and the shot put, the athlete must stay ina\ncircle until the hammer lands. They spin several times\nto gain momentum prior to releasing the hammer.\nBalance is important due to the force generated by\nhaving the heavy ball at the end of the long wire.\n\nRules for field events\n\nIn general, most field events allow an athlete to take their\nattempt individually, under the same conditions as the\nother athletes. Each attempt is measured to determine who\nachieved the longest distance or maximum height.\n¢ Horizontal jumps (long jump and triple jump) must be\ninitiated from behind a line. In the case of throws, that\nline is an arc or inside a circle. Crossing the line while\ninitiating the attempt will invalidate the attempt. It will\nbe considered as a foul.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nJ SLYOdS GNV SHNV*Y) TVNCIAICN]\n\n8/24/2020 11:37:39 AM\n\n\ne All landings must occur inside the area called safe.\nFor the jumps, it is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a\ndefined sector.\n\ne A throw landing on the line, on the edge of sector, is\na foul.\n\ne Assuming a proper attempt, officials will then measure\nthe distance from the closest landing point back to the\n\nline.\nThe details aim at making e Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that\nus understand that the measurement is taken (again) using a steel tape and\n\nathletes participate in\ndifferent types of jumping\nand throwing events.\n\nobserved by at least three officials (plus usually the\nmeet referee).\n\nIdentify — ° The leading 8 competitors in jumps (Long Jump and\nHorizontal Jump (1) Triple Jump only) and throws will get three more\n(2) attempts in addition to the 3 attempts they already\nVertical Jump (1) have taken.\n(2) ¢ In vertical jumps (High Jump and Pole Vault), set the\nThrows (1)\n\n(2) bar at a particular height.\n\n(3) e The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it\noff the stands that are holding the bar (flat).\n\ne Three failures in a row will end the competitor’s\nparticipation in the event.\n\ne The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt.\n\ne A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a\njump. However, that would not improve their position\nin the standings.\n\ne After all competitors have cleared, passed or failed their\nattempts at a height, the bar height will be raised.\n\n¢ The height of the bar raised is predetermined before the\ncompetition. Though when one competitor remains,\nthat competitor may choose their own selected height\nfor the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each\nattempt by each competitor.\n\ne After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one\nwho jumps the highest height is the winner. The bar\ndoes not shift to a lower height except to break a tie\nfor first place or a qualifying position. If those critical\npositions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers,\nall tied competitors will take a fourth jump at the last\nheight.\n\nIf they still miss, the bar will go down one increment\n\nwhere they will again jump.

Running, jumping and throwing have been\nuniversal forms of human physical activities since the human\nbeings exist. The first recorded example of organised track\nand field events is found in the Ancient Olympic Games\nheld in 776 BC. The starting of the modern Olympic Games\nat Greece in 1896 was marked as new era for track and\nfield events which was initiated by Pierre-de-Coubertin.\nUntil the early 1920s, only males were participating in the\ntrack and field events. Introduction of five track and field events\nfor women in the athletics was started during 1928 Summer\nOlympics. Gradually more women’s events were introduced as\ntime progressed. However, it was only towards the second half\nof the twentieth century that the men’s and women’s track and\nfield events were given equal status. Furthermore, major track\nand field events for disabled athletes were first introduced\nat the 1960 Summer Para Olympics. From 1990’s onwards,\ntrack and field events became increasingly more professional.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n8/24/2020 11:37:17 AM\n",

Middle-distance races require\ndifferent skills and tactics to win the sprints competition.\nThese races require that the athletes maintain a plateau\npace, (i.e. the maintenance of speed at which the runner\nis running) that allows for a final spurt of speed, whereas\nsprint races need to be run at top speed for the entire length\nof the race.\n\nLong distance\n\nThere are four common long distance running events in track and\nfield. These are 3000 meters, 5000 meters and 10,000 meters\nand 3000 meters steeplechase. Long distance track races have\nmuch in common with middle distance races.

Common relay\nraces are the 4x 100 meter and the 4x400 meter. The exchange\nof baton takes place within a specified\narea of the track called baton exchange\nzone. Teams may be disqualified if the\nteam fails to complete the baton exchange\nwithin an area of 20 meters, the team is\nconsidered as disqualified.

Long jump: The long jump is one of the oldest field\nevents. The take-off has to be made from a 20 cm\nwide board one meter away from a pit. Athletes\nsprint along a length of track to a take off board and\na sandpit. If any part of the runner’s foot goes past\nthe takeoff board, the jumper is considered for a foul\nand does not receive score for that round. Distance\nis measured from the end of the takeoff board to the\nnearest mark made by the jumper on the pit. Best\neight competitors have a maximum of six rounds.\nProfessional long jumpers typically have strong\nacceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes\nmust also have a consistent stride to allow them to\ntake off near the board while still maintaining their\nmaximum speed.\n\nJ SLYOdS GNV SHNV*Y) TVNCIAICN]\n\nFig. 4.11: Long jump\n\n2. Triple jump: Similar to the long jump, the triple jump\ntakes place on a field heading towards a sandpit.\nThis event is termed as the “hop-step and jump.”\nThe event begins like a long jump, with competitor\ndashing down the runway and leaping from a takeoff\nboard they first hop then take a step and then jump\ninto the pit. The event is scored identically to the\nlong jump.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-4.indd 43 8/24/2020 11:37:25 AM\n",

The athlete has to hold the javelin by its grip,\nthrow the javelin overhand and cannot turn the back to\nthe target when throwing. When throwing the javelin,\nthe athlete runs down a runway to gain momentum and\nthen must throw the javelin prior to crossing a line. The\nathlete cannot go over the line until the javelin lands. To\navoid foul, the athlete must have a really good balance at\nthe end of the throw.

Hammer Throw: The hammer throw doesn’t actually\ninvolve throwing a hammer like you would think.\nIn this throwing event the athletes throw a heavy\nball (7.265 Kg for men and 4 Kg for women) that is\nattached to a handle with a long (4 feet) wire. Like the\ndiscus and the shot put, the athlete must stay ina\ncircle until the hammer lands. They spin several times\nto gain momentum prior to releasing the hammer.\nBalance is important due to the force generated by\nhaving the heavy ball at the end of the long wire.\n\nRules for field events\n\nIn general, most field events allow an athlete to take their\nattempt individually, under the same conditions as the\nother athletes. Each attempt is measured to determine who\nachieved the longest distance or maximum height.\n¢ Horizontal jumps (long jump and triple jump) must be\ninitiated from behind a line. In the case of throws, that\nline is an arc or inside a circle. Crossing the line while\ninitiating the attempt will invalidate the attempt.

However\nthere are other individual sports like Badminton, Gymnastics,\nTable Tennis, Tennis, Swimming and Combative Sports such\nas Judo and Boxing. We shall discuss these games in this\nchapter.\n\n1077CHOS\n\nBADMINTON\n\nBadminton is a racket sport played by either two opposing\nplayers (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles). The players\ntake positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court that\nis divided by a net. It is one of the few sports where men and\nwomen can play together. It is a game for all ages and abilities.\nAlthough fitness is a key aspect for professional players, it is\nalso played as a recreation game across the world.\n\nHistory\n\nThe origin of the badminton dates back to second century\nBC. Although it appears that this sport was named after\nBadminton House, Gloucestershire, owned by the Duke\nof Beaufort. In 1873, some British army officers in India\ninitially played the game at ‘Poonah’ (now known as Pune)\nthus derived its name. In 1877 first set of rules were derived.\nThese laws were gradually adopted by other nations. However,\nthe game evolved as an international sport only after the\nfirst All England Championship. In 1934, the International\nBadminton Federation (now known as Badminton World\nFederation) was formed and the rules of the game were\nstandardized. Badminton Association of India came into\nexistence in the year 1934. Various state level associations\nare affiliated to it.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-5.indd 52 8/24/2020 11:38:26 AM\n\n\nEvents\n\nThe events played in badminton are: (a) Singles’ (Men,\nWomen), (b) Doubles’ (Men, Women), (c) Mixed Doubles’\n(Combination of one Man and one Woman) and (d) Teams’\nEvent (Men, Women, Mixed)\n\nCourt\n\nThe court is rectangular, and is divided into 2 halves by a\nnet. Court is usually marked for both singles’ and doubles’\nplay. The doubles’ court is wider than the ‘singles’ court.\n\nThe full width of the court is 6.1 metres, and in singles\nthis width is reduced to 5.18 metres. The full length of the\ncourt is 13.4 metres. The service courts are marked by a\ncentre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service\nline at a distance of 1.98 metres from the net, and by the\nouter side and back boundaries. In doubles’, the service\ncourt is also marked by a long service line, which is 0.76\nmetres from the back boundary.\n\nThe net is 1.55 metres high at the edges and 1.524 metres\nhigh in the centre. The net posts are placed over the doubles\nsidelines, even when singles is played.\n\n?\n\n—\nPa\n2\nis)\n5\nseq g = gagegq iw\nBee : 4 5 gE ¢ O\nea¢ 2 é ¢ 28g 40mm 5\nalle 3.80 m 1.90m F1.90m 3.80 m i z\n— 40 mm a\nRight Service Court 2\n\na\ng = g\n= g z\ng S te\ng/§ ' : 8 -\n\noS 5.

Grip: Holding grip of a badminton racket is the\nfoundation of playing this game. Holding the racket\nwrongly will reduce the power and accuracy of the\nstroke. The shots will be limited. A player needs to\nlearn how to change grip quickly during games. Below\nare the two basic types of badminton grips.\n\nForehand grip\n\n¢ This grip is used to hit shots on the forehand side of the\nbody and around the head shots.\n\ne In this a player holds the racket head in the non-playing\nhand, keeping the handle points towards the body. The\nface of the racket perpendicular to the floor.\n\ne The player places the playing hand on the handle\njust like shaking hands with it, it is like a V shape in\nbetween thumb and index finger.\n\ne For flexibility, the racket handle rest loosely in the fingers.\n\ne In order to increase control and accuracy while serving\nand hitting from the forecourt and mid court, the grip\nis shortened and placed nearer to the shaft.\n\nZz\nGg\nS\nS\nS\noo\nE\ns\nBi\nop)\nZ\nS)\nDM\nU\n)\n4\nDn\n\nAngle 2\n\nFig. 5.2: Forehand grip\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-5.indd 55 8/24/2020 11:38:29 AM\n\n\nHEALTH AND PuysicAL Epucation - CLass X\n\n| Chap-5.indd 56\n\nBackhand grip\n\nWhile playing backhand grip, shots is hit from\nbackhand (left) side of player’s body.\n\nThe player holds the racket in the same way as it was\nheld in forehand grip.\n\nThe player turns the racket anti-clockwise so that the\nV shape moves leftwards.\n\nThe player places the thumb against the back of the\nhandle for greater leverage and power.\n\nThe other techniques are the same as in forehand grip.\n\nAngle 1\n\nAngle 2\n\nFig. 5.3: Backhand grip\n\n2. Service: There are basically three types of serves —\nhigh, low and flat. High service is the most basic of\nall strokes. One needs to learn this first when one\nstarts playing the game. You need to concentrate on\nthe following three broad points while delivering the\nhigh service.\n\ne Stance: To deliver the high service, the player has\nto take a position about two feet from the short\nservice line and about six inches from the centre\nline.\n\nThe player has to make sure not to touch the\ncentre line as it will be called a touch fault. The\nplayer has to stand comfortably with both feet\nspread apart and parallel to each other and take\nthe initial serving position. At this stage, the full\nweight of the body is on the back foot.\n\nPoint of Contact: As one starts the forward\nmovement of the racket, slowly start shifting the\nweight from the back foot to the front foot. The\nplayer then drops the shuttle and hit it high and\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n8/24/2020 11:38:34 AM\n\n\nChap-5.indd 57\n\nback to the baseline. The player must make sure\nthat the point of contact is always below the waist.\n\ne Follow-through: Once the service is delivered, the\nplayer continues to swing the racket right across\nthe left shoulder (or right shoulder if the player is\nleft-handed). This is called the follow through.\n\n3. Return of Service: This stroke plays a crucial part in\na rally because good return of serve allows a player to\ndictate terms and control a rally till the point is won.\nHowever weak return of serve will allow the opponent\nto go on the offensive. While receiving the serve to hit\nthe shuttle, normally players stand in the centre of the\ncourt with the left foot forward and place the weight\nof the body more on the front foot. It will help the\nplayer to receive all types of serves i.e. high, low and\nflick. In fact, players are advised to take the stance\ncloser to the short service because in high serve the\nshuttle remains in the air for a longer duration. On\na high serve, a player has the choice of playing an\nattacking clear, drop shot, smash or a half smash.\nSimilarly, on a low serve, a player can flick, push or\nlift the shuttle to the baseline. It is important to try\nto meet the shuttle as close to the net as possible so\nthat the receiver has more options available to choose\nthe shots.\n\nGYMNASTICS\n\nGymnastics is a sport that involves physical movements\nin a sequence. It requires physical strength, balance,\ncoordination, endurance, flexibility and body control. It\noften involves dance moves, flips, twists, jumps and other\nmoves. It helps children to develop physical coordination and\nmotor skills, proper use of balance develop a good sense of\nprecision and timing. It can be performed as a way to stay fit\nor specifically to compete in events locally, nationally as well\nas internationally.\n\nHistory\n\nGymnastics was developed for fitness and beauty practices\nby the ancient Greeks. It included skills for mounting\nand dismounting a horse, and circus performance skills.\nThe Greeks used gymnastics as military training. However,\nin the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the\nGerman physical educators created exercises for boys\nand young men on apparatus. Their design is considered\nas modern gymnastics. The Federation of International\nGymnastics was founded in 1881. By the end of the\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nZz\nGg\nS\nS\nS\noo\nE\ns\nBi\nop)\nZ\nS)\nDM\nU\nfe)\n4\nDn\n\n8/24/2020 11:38:34 AM\n\n\nnineteenth century, men’s gymnastics competition was\npopular enough to be included in the first “Modern” Olympic\nGames in 1896 and women gymnasts were included in\nOlympic Games in 1986. The first world cup in gymnastics\nwas organised in 1975.\n\nForms of gymnastics\n\nThe major forms of gymnastics are: Artistic gymnastics,\nRhythmic gymnastics, Trampolining, Tumbling and Acrobatic\nGymnastics.\n\nArtistic gymnastics\n\nArtistic gymnastics is usually divided into Men’s and Women’s\nGymnastics. Men compete in six events. These are floor\nexercise, pommel horse, still rings/roman rings, vaulting\ntable, parallel bars, and horizontal bar. Women compete on\nfour events. These are floor exercise, vaulting table, uneven\nbars, and balancing beam.\n\n1. Events for men\n\n(i) Floor Exercise: For this event a 12x12 square\nspring floor is required. A series of tumbling\npasses are performed to demonstrate flexibility,\nstrength, and balance. The gymnast must also\nshow strength skills, including circles, scales, and\npress handstands. Men’s floor routines usually\nhave four passes that will total between 50-70\nseconds and are performed without music. As per\nrules, male gymnasts touch each corner of the\nfloor at least once during their routine.\n\n(ii) Pommel Horse: A typical pommel horse exercise\ninvolves both single leg and double leg skills.\nSingle leg skills are generally found in the form of\nscissors, often done on the pommels. Double leg\nskill, however, is the main staple of this event.\nThe gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion\n\nFig. 5.4: Pommel horse (clockwise or counterclockwise depending on\n\npreference) and performs such skills on all parts\n\nof the apparatus. Gymnasts will often include\nvariations on a typical circling skill by turning or\nby straddling their legs. This makes the exercises\nof gymnast more challenging. A gymnast performs\n\na dismount, either by swinging his body over the\n\nhorse or landing after a handstand.\n\nHEALTH AND PuysicAL Epucation - CLass X\n\n(iii) Still Rings: The rings are attached to a wire cable\nfrom a point to 5.75 meters from the floor, and\nadjusted in height so, that the gymnast has room\nto hang freely and swing. The gymnast performs a\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-5.indd 58 8/24/2020 11:38:35 AM\n\n\nroutine demonstrating balance, strength, power,\nand dynamic motion while preventing the rings\nthemselves from swinging. At least one static\nstrength move is required, but some gymnast\nincludes two or three strenghts. A routine should\nhave a dismount at the end of routine.\n\n(iv) Vault: In this, the gymnasts sprint down a runway,\nwhich is a maximum of 25 meters in length, before\nhurdling onto a spring board. The body position is\nmaintained while “punching” (blocking using only a\nshoulder movement) the vaulting board. The\ngymnast then rotates to a standing position. Multiple\ntwists and somersaults are added before landing in\ncase of advance gymnastics. Vaults depend on the\nspeed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power\nthe gymnast generated from the legs and shoulder\ngirdle and the kinesthetic awareness in the air. In » 59\ncase of more difficult and complex vaults the speed Fig. 5.5: Vault\nof rotation is more important.\n\n(v) Parallel Bars: Men perform\non two bars. These are\nkept slightly further than\na shoulder’s width apart\nand usually 1.75 m high.\nFor executing a_ series\n\nof swings, balances,\n\nand releases require\n\ngreat strength and co- Fig. 5.6: Parallel bars\nordination.\n\nJ] SIYOdS GNV SHNV®) TVNCIAIGNT\n\n(vi) Horizontal Bar: A 2.8 cm thick steel or fiberglass\nbar raised 2.5m above the landing area is all the\ngymnasts have to hold onto as they perform giants\n(revolutions around the bar), release skills, twists,\nand changes of direction. By using all of the\nmomentum from giants and then releasing at the\nproper point, enough height can be achieved for\nspectacular dismounts. Leather grips are usually\nused to help maintain a grip on the bar.\n\n2. Events for women\n\n(i) Floor Exercise: The floor event occurs on a carpeted\n12m x 12m square, usually consisting of hard foam\nover a layer of plywood, which is supported by\nsprings or foam blocks generally called a “spring”\nfloor. Female gymnasts perform a choreographed\nroutine of 50 to 70 seconds in this event. The\nroutine should consist of tumbling lines, series of\njumps, dance elements, acrobatic skills, and turns.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-5.indd 59 8/24/2020 11:38:36 AM\n\n\n(ii) Vault: In the vaulting events gymnasts sprint\ndown a 25 meters (82 ft) runway, jump onto or\nperform a round off entry onto a beat board or\nspring board, land momentarily, inverted on the\nhands on the vaulting horse or vaulting table.\nThen they spring off this platform to a two footed\nlanding. Every gymnast starts at a different point\non the vault runway depending on her height and\nstrength. The post flight segment may include one\nor more multiple somersaults, and/or twisting\nmovements. In vaults with round-off entries,\ngymnasts “round-off’? so that hands are on the\nrunway while the feet land on the springboard.\nFrom the round-off position the gymnast travels\nbackwards as in a back handspring so that the\nhands land on the vaulting platform (horse).\nShe then blocks off the vaulting platform into\nvarious twisting and somersaulting combinations.\n\n(iii) Uneven Bars: On the uneven bars (also known as\nFig. 5.7: Uneven bars asymmetric bars), the gymnast performs a routine\non two horizontal bars set at different heights. The\nheight is generally fixed, but the width may be\nadjusted. Gymnasts perform swinging, circling,\ntransitional, and release moves, as well as moves\nthat pass through the handstand. Usually in higher\nlevels of gymnastics, leather grips are worn to ensure\nthat the gymnast maintains a grip on the bar, and\nto protect the hands from blisters and tears.\n\n(iv) Balance Beam: The gymnast performs a\nchoreographed routine from 70 to 90 seconds\nin length consisting of leaps, acrobatic skills,\nturns and dance elements on a padded spring\nbeam. Apparatus norms set by the International\nGymnastics Federation specify that the beam\n\nFig. 5.8: Balance beam must be 125 cm (4) high, 500 cm (16?) long, and\n\n10 cm (4.5”) wide. The event requires in particular,\n\nbalance, flexibility and strength.\n\n3.

This combines\nelements of ballet, gymnastics, dance and apparatus\nmanipulation. The sport involves the performance of\nfive separate routines with the use of five apparatus\n— Ball, Ribbon, Hoop, Clubs, Rope on a floor area,\nwith a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather\nthan the acrobatic.\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-5.indd 60 8/24/2020 11:38:37 AM\n\n\nChap-5.indd 61\n\n4. Acrobatic gymnastics\n\nAcrobatic gymnastics is one of the _ oldest\nforms of organised physical activities,\nand today it is being reorganised, revitalised by\nchanges and renewed interest. The International\nFederation of Sports Acrobatics (IFSA) was founded\nin Moscow in 1973. United States Sports Acrobatics\n(USSA) was founded in 1975. It was merged with\nInternational Gymnastics federation (FIG) in 1999.\nSports Acrobatics was demonstration sports at the\n2000 Olympics in Sydney. Now, it is an accepted\ncompetitive sport. It is very effective for the\ndevelopment of physical fitness and graceful posture.\n\nAcrobatic gymnastics is a group gymnastic discipline\nfor both men and women. Acrobats in groups of two,\nthree and four perform routines with the heads,\nhands and feet of their partners. They may, subject to\nregulations (e.g. instrumental), pick their own music.\n\n5. Tumbling and trampolining\n\nTumbling, also known as power tumbling, is a\ngymnastics sporting discipline which combines skills\nof artistic gymnastics with those of trampolining. It\nis sometimes practiced on a 25-meter-long spring\ntrack, competitors both male and female, perform two\npasses, each containing eight skills, along the track.\n\nTABLE TENNIS\n\nTable Tennis is also known as Ping-Pong, in which two or\nfour players participate using table-tennis rackets on a plain\nhard surface called Table, which is divided by a net.\n\nHistory\n\nThe game of Table Tennis probably descended from the\ngame of ‘Royal Tennis’, which was played in the medieval\nera (12th century A.D.) Table Tennis was probably played\nwith improvised equipment in England during the last\nquarter of 19th century. Evidence show that David Foster\nin England patented an action game of Tennis on Table in\n1890. One year later John Jaques came out with a game\ncalled Gossima. In 1900, a celluloid ball was introduced by\nJaques and the name was given as ‘Ping-Pong’. Table Tennis\nis controlled by ITTF (International Table Tennis Federation)\nwhich was founded in 1926 with headquarters in Berlin. It\nwas introduced in Olympics in 1988 in Seoul, South Korea.\nFirst World Championship of Table-Tennis was held in\nLondon in 1926. TTFI (Table-Tennis Federation of India) was\nformed in 1926 in Calcutta, now known as Kolkata.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n61\n\nJ] SIYOdS GNV SHNV®) TVNCIAIGNT\n\n8/24/2020 11:38:37 AM\n\n\n6 Inch Net Height\nfi\n\nFig. 5.9: Table tennis\n\nRules\n\n« Table Tennis table is 9 ft.

Grip: Players grip their rackets in a variety of ways.\nThe manner in which players grip their rackets can\nbe classified into two major categories i.e. Pen hold\ngrip (mainly used by Chinese and Korean) and shake\nhand or Orthodox grip (commonly used).\n\n¢ Pen hold grip: In this, one grips the racket in such\na way as one holds a pen. It involves index finger\nand think joining each other across the handle\nand curling the middle, ring and fourth finger on\nthe back of the blade. The three fingers however,\nwill always remain touching one another.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-5.indd 62 8/24/2020 11:38:37 AM\n\n\nChap-5.indd 63\n\nFig. 5.10: Pen hold grip\n\ne Shake hand grip: In this grip, the racket is held\nin such a way as one shakes hand with someone.\nThe shake hand grip is used due to increasingly\nfast nature of the game, making the backhand\nstroke more effective.\n\n2. Services: There are different kind, of services, such as,\nlong service, short service, spin service, flat service,\nhigh toss service and back-hand or forehand service.\n\n3. Types of strokes: The two types of strokes are offensive\nand defensive including backhand and forehand.\n\n(i) Offensive strokes (drive, loop drive, loop, loop kill,\nhook, counter drive, flip and smash)\n\na) Drive: The racket is primarily perpendicular\nto the direction of the stroke, and most of the\nenergy applied to the ball results in speed\nrather than spin, creating a shot that does\nnot arc much, but it is fast enough to make it\ndifficult to return.\n\nb) Loop drive: The racket is much more parallel\nto the direction of the stroke (closed) and the\nracket thus grazes the ball, resulting in a large\namount of topspin. Variations in spin and\nspeed add to the effectiveness of this shot.\n\nc) Loop: The loop produces a more pronounced\nloopy arc, with a higher trajectory and extreme\ntopspin, but is typically slower.\n\nd) Loop kill: The loop kill produces a flatter arc,\nwith higher speed that resembles a speed\ndrive but with stronger topspin.\n\ne) Hook: It is similar to a regular Loop, but carries\na tilted topspin (or is referred as the “top-side”\nspin), it bounces sideways and downward\nupon hitting the table.\n\nf) Counter drive: It is a counter attack against\ndrives (normally high loop drives). One has\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nZz\nGg\nS\nS\nS\noo\nE\ns\nBi\nop)\nZ\nS)\nDM\nU\nfe)\n4\nDn\n\n8/24/2020 11:38:38 AM\n\n\nto bring close to the racket and stay close to\nthe ball (try to predict its path). The racket is\nheld closed and near to the ball, which is hit\nwith a short movement off the bounce (before\nreaching the highest point) so that the ball\ntravels faster to the other side.\n\ng) Flip: When a player tries to attack a ball that\nhas not bounced beyond the edge of the table,\nhowever the ball may still be attacked, and the\nresulting shot is called flip because the back\nswing is compressed into a quick wrist action.\n\nh) Smash: Smash is executed when his or her\nopponent has returned a ball that bounces too\nhigh and/ or too close to the net. Smashing\nis a large back swing and rapid acceleration\nimparting as much speed on the ball as possible.\n\n(ii) Defensive strokes\n\na) Push or Slice: The push is usually used for\nkeeping the point alive and creating offensive\nopportunities. A push resembles a tennis slice,\nthe racket cuts underneath the ball, imparting\nbackspin and causing the ball to float slowly\nto the other side of the table. Offensive players\nshould only push for variation and not for\ngeneral rallies.\n\nb) Chop: A chop or cut is the defensive, backspin\ncounterpart to the offensive loop drive. A chop\nis essentially a bigger, heavier slice, taken well\nback from the table. Sometimes a defensive\nplayer can impart no spin on the ball during\na chop, or frequently add right- or left-hand\nspin to the ball. This may further confuse his/\nher opponent.\n\n*\nB\ns\n\\)\nZz\niS)\nE\nS\n5\na\nca\n<\ng\na\nFe\n4\na\n2\n:\na]\nan)\n\nc) Block: A block is executed by simply putting\nthe racket in front of the ball, the ball rebounds\nback toward the opponent with nearly as\nmuch energy as it came in with. This is not\nas easy as it sounds, because the ball’s spin,\nspeed, and location, all influence the correct\nangle of a block.\n\nd) Side spin drive: The premise of this move is to\nput a spin on the ball either to the right or the\nleft of the racket. The execution of this move\nis similar to a slice, but to the right or left,\ninstead of down. This spin will result in the ball\ncurving to the side but bouncing in the opposite\ndirection when the opponent returns it.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-5.indd 64 8/24/2020 11:38:38 AM\n\n\nChap-5.indd 65\n\ne) Lob: The defensive High Ball or Lob is\ndeceptive in its simplicity. To execute a High\nBall, a defensive player first backs off the table\n8-10 meters; then, the stroke itself consists of\nsimply lifting the ball to an enormous height\nbefore it falls back to the opponent’s side of\nthe table. A High Ball is inherently a creative\nshot, and can have nearly any kind of spin.\n\nf) Drop shot: The drop shot is a high level stroke,\nused as another variation for close-to-table\nstrokes. The player has position the racket close\nto the ball and just let the ball touch it (without\nany hand movement) in a way that the ball stays\nclose to the net with almost no speed and spin,\nand touches the other side of the table more\nthan twice if the opponent doesn’t reach it.\n\nSkills\n\nForehand drive\n\nKeep arm close to the torso.\n\nForearm makes 90° with the upper arm.\n\nDraw the forearm back to another 45°.\n\nLet the waist turn naturally along with the arm and\nshift your weight towards the right foot.\n\nSwing forward with a slight upward motion while\nshifting your weight back to left foot.\n\nElbow should be used as a pivot point and should only\nmove a little forward in the follow through.\n\nJ] SIYOdS GNV SHNV®) TVNCIAIGNT\n\nFig. 5.11: Forehand drive\n\nBackhand drive\n\nForm ready position.\n\nTurn waist towards left with Racket towards 9 O’clock\nposition.\n\nContact with the ball is made in front of the body\nslightly after the top of the bounce.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n8/24/2020 11:38:42 AM\n\n\ne Elbow acts as pivot point.\ne Snap the forearm forward in slightly upward direction.\n\ne Power comes with the flick of the wrist.\ne Follow through until the racket points after the ball.\n\nFig. 5.12: Backhand drive\n\nBlocking\nIt is a backup shot, when there isn’t enough time for a full\ndrive or loop.

Later the game was\nrefined in England in the 19th century as lawn tennis which\nresembled the sport played today. The world’s oldest tennis\ntournament, the Wimbledon Championships were first played\nin London in 1877. The comprehensive rules promulgated\nin 1924 by the International Lawn Tennis Federation, now\nknown as the International Tennis Federation, have remained\nlargely stable, one of the major changes being the addition of\nthe tie-back system. The Davis Cup, an annual competition\nbetween men’s national teams, dates to 1900. The analogous\ncompetition for women’s national teams, the Fed Cup, was\nfounded as the Federation Cup in 1963. There are four top\ntournaments called the Grand Slam Tournaments, these\nare Wimbledon, the US Open, the Australian Open, and the\nFrench Open.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\neuusluy\n\nW908\n\nwy, 7YysI9H\nSUTTIID UNUITUTIAL\n\nJ] SIYOdS GNV SHNV®) TVNCIAIGNT\n\n8/24/2020 11:38:49 AM\n\n\nHEALTH AND PuysicAL Epucation - CLass X\n\n| Chap-5.indd 68\n\nRules\n\nThe following are the rules regarding equipment, balls, court,\nlines and scoring:\n\n1. Equipment\n\n(i) Racquets: Tennis racquet must adhere to the\nfollowing guidelines —\n\ne The hitting area, composed of the strings,\nmust be flat and generally uniform.\n\ne The frame of the hitting area may not be more\nthan 29 inches in length and 12.5 inches in\nwidth.\n\ne The entire racquet must be of a fixed shape,\nsize, weight, and weight distribution. There\nmay not be any energy source built into the\nracquet.\n\ne The racquet must not provide any kind of\ncommunication, instruction or advice to the\nplayer during the match.\n\n(ii) Balls: Tennis balls are of hollow rubber with a\nfelt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant\ncolour was gradually changed to optic yellow in\nthe latter part of the 20th century to ensure better\nvisibility.\n\n(iii) Court\n\ne Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface,\nusually grass or clay, a hard court of concrete\nand/or asphalt and occasionally carpet\n(indoor). The court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long,\nand 27 feet (8.23 m) wide for singles matches\nand 36 ft (10.97 m) for doubles’ matches.\n\ne Additional clear space around the court is\nrequired for players so as to reach over run\nballs.\n\ne A net is stretched across the full width of the\ncourt, parallel with the baselines, dividing it\ninto two equal ends. The net is 3 feet 6 inches\n(1.07 m) high at the posts and 3 feet (91.4 cm)\nhigh in the center.\n\n(iv) Lines\n\ne The lines that delineate the width of the court\nare called the baseline (farthest back) and the\nservice line (middle of the court).\n\ne The short mark in the center of each baseline\nis referred to as either the hash mark or the\ncenter mark.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n8/24/2020 11:38:49 AM\n\n\nChap-5.indd 69\n\nThe outermost lines that make up the length\nare called the doubles’ sidelines. These are\nthe boundaries used when doubles is being\nplayed.\n\nThe lines to the inside of the doubles’\nsidelines are the singles’ sidelines and used as\nboundaries in singles’ play. The area between\na doubles’ sideline and the nearest singles’\nsideline is called the doubles’ alley, which is\nconsidered playable in doubles’ play.\n\nThe line that runs across the center of a\nplayer’s side of the court is called the service\nline because the serve must be delivered into\nthe area between the service line and the net\non the receiving side.\n\nAll the lines are required to be 2 inches\n(51 mm) in width. The baseline can be up to 4\ninches (100 mm) wide if so desired.\n\n(v) Scoring\n\nThe players (or teams) start on opposite sides\nof the net. One player is designated as the\nserver, and the opposing player is the receiver.\n\nA tennis match is determined through the\nbest of 3 or 5 sets. Women play 3 set matches,\nwhile men play 5 set matches. For men, the\nfirst player to win three sets wins the match,\nand for women, the first player to win two sets\nwins the match.\n\nA set consists of games, and a game, in turn,\nconsists of a sequence of points played with\nthe same player serving.\n\nA game is won by the first player to have won\nat least four points in total and at least two\npoints more than the opponent.\n\nThe running score of each game is described\nin a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from\nzero to three points are described as “love”,\n“15”, “30”, and “40” respectively\n\nIf at least three points have been scored by\neach player, making the player’s score equal\nat 40 a piece, the score is not called out as\n“40-40”, but rather as “deuce”.\n\nIf at least three points have been scored by\neach side and a player has one more point\nthan the opponent, the score of the game is\n“advantage” for the player in the lead.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nZz\nGg\nS\nS\nS\noo\nE\ns\nBi\nop)\nZ\nS)\nDM\nU\nfe)\n4\nDn\n\n8/24/2020 11:38:49 AM\n\n\nHEALTH AND PuysicAL Epucation - CLass X\n\n| Chap-5.indd 70\n\ne A game point occurs in tennis whenever\nthe player who is in the lead in the game\nneeds only one more point to win the game.\nThe terminology is extended to sets (set\npoint), matches (match point), and even\nchampionships (championship point).\n\ne A break point occurs if the receiver, not the\nsever, has a chance to win the game with\nthe next point. Break points are of particular\nimportance because serving is generally\nconsidered advantageous, with the server being\nexpected to win games in which they are serving.\n\ne A receiver who has one (score of 30-40), two\n(score of 15-40) or three (score of love-40)\nconsecutive chances to win the game has\nbreak point, double break point or triple break\npoint, respectively.\n\ne Ifthe leading player wins that game, the player\nwins the set 7-5. If the trailing player wins\nthe game, a tie-break is played. A tie-break,\nplayed under a separate set of rules, allows\none player to win one more game and thus the\nset, to give a final set score of 7-6.\n\ne In tournament play, the chair umpire\nannounces the winner of the set and the\noverall score.\n\n2. Grip\n\nA grip is a way of holding the racquet in order to hit\nshots during a match. There are three types of grip.\n\ni. Forehand: the tennis forehand is a stroke in\nwhich the inner side of the palm of the dominant\nhand that is holding the racket faces forward. The\nforehand stroke is made by swinging the racket\nacross one’s body in the direction of where one\nwants to land the ball.\n\nii. Backhand: The backhand is a tennis stroke in\nwhich one swings the racquet around one’s body\nwith the back of the hand preceding the palm.\n\niii. The Serve (Service): A serve in tennis is a shot to\nstart a pint. A player will hit the ball with racquet\nso it will fall into the diagonally opposite service\nbox without being stopped by the net. There are\nthree types of serve —\n\na) Flat Serve\nb) Slice Serve\nc) Kick Serve\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n8/24/2020 11:38:49 AM\n\n\nChap-5.indd 71\n\nSWIMMING\n\nSwimming is a water based sport where a person propels the\nbody through the water by arms, known as strokes and legs\nthat are called kicks and move progressively through water.\nIt is a sport for all round development of the child. Swimming\nimproves cardiovascular system and places minimum stress\non joints. It employs major muscle groups of the body leading\nto a well-developed flexible muscular system. Swimming is\nalso important for physical rehabilitation for people suffering\nfrom disabilities or those recovering from injuries.\n\nFig. 5.15: Swimming\n\nHistory\n\nSwimming is a sport that was included in the first modern\nOlympic Games at Athens in 1896, diving events were\nadded in 1904 and women’s competitions were recognised\nin 1912. FINA (Federation International de Notation) was\nformed at London Olympic in 1908 AD. National Swimming\nAssociation of India was founded in 1949. Swimming\nwas one of the six sports at the First Asian Games held\nat Delhi in 1951. The aquatic sport of swimming involves\ncompetition amongst participants to be the fastest over a\ngiven distance. Different distances are covered in different\nlevels of competition.\n\nRules\n\ne A swimmer must finish the race in the same lane.\nSwimming across another lane or interfering with the\nother shall disqualify the offender.\n\ne During a turn the swimmer shall touch the end of\nthe pool.\n\ne A swimmer should not walk.\n\ne Any swimmer not participating in a race, who enters the\nwater in which an event is being conducted before all\n\nswimmers shall be disqualified from the next scheduled\nrace in the meet.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nJ] SIYOdS GNV SHNV®) TVNCIAIGNT\n\n8/24/2020 11:38:50 AM\n\n\ne There shall be four swimmers in each relay team. In\nrelay events, the team of swimmers whose feet lose\ntouch with the starting platform before the preceding\nteammate touches the wall shall be disqualified. Any\nrelay team shall be disqualified from a race if a team\nmember, other than the swimmer designated to swim\nthat length, enters the water when the race is being\nconducted, before swimmers of all teams have finished\nthe race. The member of a relay team and their order\nof competing must be nominated before the race. Any\nrelay team member may compete in a race only once.\n\ne The composition of a relay team may be changed\nbetween the heats and finals of the event, provided that\nitis made up from the list of swimmers properly entered\nby a member for that event. Failure to swim in the\norder listed will result in disqualification. Substitutions\nmay be made only in the case of a documented\nmedical emergency.\n\ne Any swimmer having finished the race, or the stipulated\ndistance in a relay event, must leave the pool as soon\nas possible without obstructing any other swimmer\nwho has not yet finished the race. Otherwise the\nswimmer committing the fault or the relay team shall\nbe disqualified.\n\ne Should a foul endanger the chances of success of a\nswimmer, the referees shall have the power to allow the\nswimmer to compete in the next heat or, should the\nfoul occur in a final event or in the last heat, they may\norder it to be re-swim.\n\nFundamental techniques\n\nTechniques in swimming are strokes, starts and turns.\n\nStrokes\n\nIn swimming there are four competitive strokes (Front\nCrawl, Back Crawl, Breast stroke and Butterfly stroke) being\nfollowed all over the world. All the above mentioned strokes\nhave been learnt in the previous class.\n\n*\nB\ns\n\\)\nZz\niS)\nE\nS\n5\na\nca\n<\ng\na\nFe\n4\na\n2\n:\na]\nan)\n\nStarts\n\nAll four competitive strokes are to be started in the competition\nby using the technique known as start. The swimmers\nemphasis on the quickest technique, which allows him a\nstronger push off from the starting position. The starting\ntechniques, popular today, are: (i) Grab start (ii) Circular\nstart (iii) Racings start (iv) Conventional start (v) Tuck start.\nThe following sequence is followed; (i) Position on the block\n(ii) Take off (iii) Flight (position in air) (iv) Entry into the water\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-5.indd 72 8/24/2020 11:38:50 AM\n\n\nChap-5.indd 73\n\n(v) Glide (vi) First stroke. However, backstroke uses almost\na uniform technique, which does not have any special name\nand is known as backstroke start.\n\nTurns\n\nDuring the race, the swimmer must take a turn from the end\nof the wall to complete the full distance. The swimmers try\nto use a technique that is quicker and gives a strong push\noff from the wall within the permissible rules of the stroke.\nThe various turns used by swimmers are: (i) Simple turn\n(ii) Throw away turn (iii) Summer Sault turn (iv) Flip turn (v)\nRoll over turn (vi) Breast stroke turn (vii) Butterfly turn.\n\nThe following sequence is followed in the turn: (i) Approach\nto the wall (ii) Turn or touch (iii) Push off (iv) Glide (v) First\nstroke.\n\nTactics\n\nSwimming is an individual and cyclic sport. It is highly\ncompetitive with the application of science. It is getting\ntransformed from an art to science. Now, the importance is\ngiven to strategy and tactics for completing and pacing the\nrace. In order to achieve the best performance, a swimmer\nmust learn to distribute the distance economically and\nthoughtfully throughout the race. Tactics in swimming\nduring different races can be categorised in three different\nphase — (i) Sprint races (ii) Middle distance races (iii) Long\ndistance races\n\nSprint races\n\nThe 50 m race or the sprint race depends on the start,\nmaintaining the speed and a good finish.\n\nMiddle and Long distance races\n\nIn these races, the key word is to build endurance and speed.\nIn middle and long distance races, the swimmer tries to\nprevent building up high oxygen debt. Swimming at a very\nfast pace will accumulate a high level of oxygen debt early\nin the race and will experience an immediate drop in speed.\nSwimmer may sometimes prefer to begin faster than an ideal\npace and attempt to get out in front avoiding the choppy\nwaters. Some swimmers like to swim the strategy races in\nrelation to the opponent.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nZz\nGg\nS\nS\nS\noo\nE\ns\nBi\nop)\nZ\nS)\nDM\nU\nfe)\n4\nDn\n\n8/24/2020 11:38:50 AM\n\n\nHEALTH AND PuysicaL EDUCATION - CLass X\n\n74\n\n| Chap-5.indd 74\n\nBR WN\n\n.

However\nthere are other individual sports like Badminton, Gymnastics,\nTable Tennis, Tennis, Swimming and Combative Sports such\nas Judo and Boxing. We shall discuss these games in this\nchapter.\n\n1077CHOS\n\nBADMINTON\n\nBadminton is a racket sport played by either two opposing\nplayers (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles). The players\ntake positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court that\nis divided by a net. It is one of the few sports where men and\nwomen can play together. It is a game for all ages and abilities.\nAlthough fitness is a key aspect for professional players, it is\nalso played as a recreation game across the world.\n\nHistory\n\nThe origin of the badminton dates back to second century\nBC. Although it appears that this sport was named after\nBadminton House, Gloucestershire, owned by the Duke\nof Beaufort. In 1873, some British army officers in India\ninitially played the game at ‘Poonah’ (now known as Pune)\nthus derived its name. In 1877 first set of rules were derived.\nThese laws were gradually adopted by other nations. However,\nthe game evolved as an international sport only after the\nfirst All England Championship. In 1934, the International\nBadminton Federation (now known as Badminton World\nFederation) was formed and the rules of the game were\nstandardized. Badminton Association of India came into\nexistence in the year 1934. Various state level associations\nare affiliated to it.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-5.indd 52 8/24/2020 11:38:26 AM\n",

Grip: Holding grip of a badminton racket is the\nfoundation of playing this game. Holding the racket\nwrongly will reduce the power and accuracy of the\nstroke. The shots will be limited. A player needs to\nlearn how to change grip quickly during games. Below\nare the two basic types of badminton grips.\n\nForehand grip\n\n¢ This grip is used to hit shots on the forehand side of the\nbody and around the head shots.\n\ne In this a player holds the racket head in the non-playing\nhand, keeping the handle points towards the body.

Service: There are basically three types of serves —\nhigh, low and flat. High service is the most basic of\nall strokes. One needs to learn this first when one\nstarts playing the game. You need to concentrate on\nthe following three broad points while delivering the\nhigh service.\n\ne Stance: To deliver the high service, the player has\nto take a position about two feet from the short\nservice line and about six inches from the centre\nline.\n\nThe player has to make sure not to touch the\ncentre line as it will be called a touch fault. The\nplayer has to stand comfortably with both feet\nspread apart and parallel to each other and take\nthe initial serving position. At this stage, the full\nweight of the body is on the back foot.\n\nPoint of Contact: As one starts the forward\nmovement of the racket, slowly start shifting the\nweight from the back foot to the front foot. The\nplayer then drops the shuttle and hit it high and\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n8/24/2020 11:38:34 AM\n",

The player must make sure\nthat the point of contact is always below the waist.\n\ne Follow-through: Once the service is delivered, the\nplayer continues to swing the racket right across\nthe left shoulder (or right shoulder if the player is\nleft-handed). This is called the follow through.\n\n3. Return of Service: This stroke plays a crucial part in\na rally because good return of serve allows a player to\ndictate terms and control a rally till the point is won.\nHowever weak return of serve will allow the opponent\nto go on the offensive. While receiving the serve to hit\nthe shuttle, normally players stand in the centre of the\ncourt with the left foot forward and place the weight\nof the body more on the front foot. It will help the\nplayer to receive all types of serves i.e. high, low and\nflick. In fact, players are advised to take the stance\ncloser to the short service because in high serve the\nshuttle remains in the air for a longer duration. On\na high serve, a player has the choice of playing an\nattacking clear, drop shot, smash or a half smash.\nSimilarly, on a low serve, a player can flick, push or\nlift the shuttle to the baseline. It is important to try\nto meet the shuttle as close to the net as possible so\nthat the receiver has more options available to choose\nthe shots.\n\nGYMNASTICS\n\nGymnastics is a sport that involves physical movements\nin a sequence. It requires physical strength, balance,\ncoordination, endurance, flexibility and body control. It\noften involves dance moves, flips, twists, jumps and other\nmoves. It helps children to develop physical coordination and\nmotor skills, proper use of balance develop a good sense of\nprecision and timing. It can be performed as a way to stay fit\nor specifically to compete in events locally, nationally as well\nas internationally.\n\nHistory\n\nGymnastics was developed for fitness and beauty practices\nby the ancient Greeks. It included skills for mounting\nand dismounting a horse, and circus performance skills.\nThe Greeks used gymnastics as military training. However,\nin the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the\nGerman physical educators created exercises for boys\nand young men on apparatus. Their design is considered\nas modern gymnastics.

The first world cup in gymnastics\nwas organised in 1975.\n\nForms of gymnastics\n\nThe major forms of gymnastics are: Artistic gymnastics,\nRhythmic gymnastics, Trampolining, Tumbling and Acrobatic\nGymnastics.\n\nArtistic gymnastics\n\nArtistic gymnastics is usually divided into Men’s and Women’s\nGymnastics. Men compete in six events. These are floor\nexercise, pommel horse, still rings/roman rings, vaulting\ntable, parallel bars, and horizontal bar. Women compete on\nfour events. These are floor exercise, vaulting table, uneven\nbars, and balancing beam.\n\n1. Events for men\n\n(i) Floor Exercise: For this event a 12x12 square\nspring floor is required. A series of tumbling\npasses are performed to demonstrate flexibility,\nstrength, and balance. The gymnast must also\nshow strength skills, including circles, scales, and\npress handstands. Men’s floor routines usually\nhave four passes that will total between 50-70\nseconds and are performed without music. As per\nrules, male gymnasts touch each corner of the\nfloor at least once during their routine.\n\n(ii) Pommel Horse: A typical pommel horse exercise\ninvolves both single leg and double leg skills.\nSingle leg skills are generally found in the form of\nscissors, often done on the pommels. Double leg\nskill, however, is the main staple of this event.\nThe gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion\n\nFig. 5.4: Pommel horse (clockwise or counterclockwise depending on\n\npreference) and performs such skills on all parts\n\nof the apparatus. Gymnasts will often include\nvariations on a typical circling skill by turning or\nby straddling their legs. This makes the exercises\nof gymnast more challenging. A gymnast performs\n\na dismount, either by swinging his body over the\n\nhorse or landing after a handstand.\n\nHEALTH AND PuysicAL Epucation - CLass X\n\n(iii) Still Rings: The rings are attached to a wire cable\nfrom a point to 5.75 meters from the floor, and\nadjusted in height so, that the gymnast has room\nto hang freely and swing.

At least one static\nstrength move is required, but some gymnast\nincludes two or three strenghts. A routine should\nhave a dismount at the end of routine.\n\n(iv) Vault: In this, the gymnasts sprint down a runway,\nwhich is a maximum of 25 meters in length, before\nhurdling onto a spring board. The body position is\nmaintained while “punching” (blocking using only a\nshoulder movement) the vaulting board. The\ngymnast then rotates to a standing position. Multiple\ntwists and somersaults are added before landing in\ncase of advance gymnastics. Vaults depend on the\nspeed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power\nthe gymnast generated from the legs and shoulder\ngirdle and the kinesthetic awareness in the air. In » 59\ncase of more difficult and complex vaults the speed Fig. 5.5: Vault\nof rotation is more important.\n\n(v) Parallel Bars: Men perform\non two bars.

By using all of the\nmomentum from giants and then releasing at the\nproper point, enough height can be achieved for\nspectacular dismounts. Leather grips are usually\nused to help maintain a grip on the bar.\n\n2. Events for women\n\n(i) Floor Exercise: The floor event occurs on a carpeted\n12m x 12m square, usually consisting of hard foam\nover a layer of plywood, which is supported by\nsprings or foam blocks generally called a “spring”\nfloor. Female gymnasts perform a choreographed\nroutine of 50 to 70 seconds in this event. The\nroutine should consist of tumbling lines, series of\njumps, dance elements, acrobatic skills, and turns.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-5.indd 59 8/24/2020 11:38:36 AM\n",

Every gymnast starts at a different point\non the vault runway depending on her height and\nstrength. The post flight segment may include one\nor more multiple somersaults, and/or twisting\nmovements. In vaults with round-off entries,\ngymnasts “round-off’? so that hands are on the\nrunway while the feet land on the springboard.\nFrom the round-off position the gymnast travels\nbackwards as in a back handspring so that the\nhands land on the vaulting platform (horse).\nShe then blocks off the vaulting platform into\nvarious twisting and somersaulting combinations.\n\n(iii) Uneven Bars: On the uneven bars (also known as\nFig. 5.7: Uneven bars asymmetric bars), the gymnast performs a routine\non two horizontal bars set at different heights. The\nheight is generally fixed, but the width may be\nadjusted. Gymnasts perform swinging, circling,\ntransitional, and release moves, as well as moves\nthat pass through the handstand. Usually in higher\nlevels of gymnastics, leather grips are worn to ensure\nthat the gymnast maintains a grip on the bar, and\nto protect the hands from blisters and tears.\n\n(iv) Balance Beam: The gymnast performs a\nchoreographed routine from 70 to 90 seconds\nin length consisting of leaps, acrobatic skills,\nturns and dance elements on a padded spring\nbeam. Apparatus norms set by the International\nGymnastics Federation specify that the beam\n\nFig. 5.8: Balance beam must be 125 cm (4) high, 500 cm (16?) long, and\n\n10 cm (4.5”) wide.

It\nis sometimes practiced on a 25-meter-long spring\ntrack, competitors both male and female, perform two\npasses, each containing eight skills, along the track.\n\nTABLE TENNIS\n\nTable Tennis is also known as Ping-Pong, in which two or\nfour players participate using table-tennis rackets on a plain\nhard surface called Table, which is divided by a net.\n\nHistory\n\nThe game of Table Tennis probably descended from the\ngame of ‘Royal Tennis’, which was played in the medieval\nera (12th century A.D.) Table Tennis was probably played\nwith improvised equipment in England during the last\nquarter of 19th century. Evidence show that David Foster\nin England patented an action game of Tennis on Table in\n1890. One year later John Jaques came out with a game\ncalled Gossima. In 1900, a celluloid ball was introduced by\nJaques and the name was given as ‘Ping-Pong’. Table Tennis\nis controlled by ITTF (International Table Tennis Federation)\nwhich was founded in 1926 with headquarters in Berlin. It\nwas introduced in Olympics in 1988 in Seoul, South Korea.\nFirst World Championship of Table-Tennis was held in\nLondon in 1926.

It involves index finger\nand think joining each other across the handle\nand curling the middle, ring and fourth finger on\nthe back of the blade. The three fingers however,\nwill always remain touching one another.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-5.indd 62 8/24/2020 11:38:37 AM\n",

Services: There are different kind, of services, such as,\nlong service, short service, spin service, flat service,\nhigh toss service and back-hand or forehand service.\n\n3. Types of strokes: The two types of strokes are offensive\nand defensive including backhand and forehand.\n\n(i) Offensive strokes (drive, loop drive, loop, loop kill,\nhook, counter drive, flip and smash)\n\na) Drive: The racket is primarily perpendicular\nto the direction of the stroke, and most of the\nenergy applied to the ball results in speed\nrather than spin, creating a shot that does\nnot arc much, but it is fast enough to make it\ndifficult to return.\n\nb) Loop drive: The racket is much more parallel\nto the direction of the stroke (closed) and the\nracket thus grazes the ball, resulting in a large\namount of topspin. Variations in spin and\nspeed add to the effectiveness of this shot.\n\nc) Loop: The loop produces a more pronounced\nloopy arc, with a higher trajectory and extreme\ntopspin, but is typically slower.\n\nd) Loop kill: The loop kill produces a flatter arc,\nwith higher speed that resembles a speed\ndrive but with stronger topspin.\n\ne) Hook: It is similar to a regular Loop, but carries\na tilted topspin (or is referred as the “top-side”\nspin), it bounces sideways and downward\nupon hitting the table.\n\nf) Counter drive: It is a counter attack against\ndrives (normally high loop drives).

The racket is\nheld closed and near to the ball, which is hit\nwith a short movement off the bounce (before\nreaching the highest point) so that the ball\ntravels faster to the other side.\n\ng) Flip: When a player tries to attack a ball that\nhas not bounced beyond the edge of the table,\nhowever the ball may still be attacked, and the\nresulting shot is called flip because the back\nswing is compressed into a quick wrist action.\n\nh) Smash: Smash is executed when his or her\nopponent has returned a ball that bounces too\nhigh and/ or too close to the net. Smashing\nis a large back swing and rapid acceleration\nimparting as much speed on the ball as possible.\n\n(ii) Defensive strokes\n\na) Push or Slice: The push is usually used for\nkeeping the point alive and creating offensive\nopportunities. A push resembles a tennis slice,\nthe racket cuts underneath the ball, imparting\nbackspin and causing the ball to float slowly\nto the other side of the table. Offensive players\nshould only push for variation and not for\ngeneral rallies.\n\nb) Chop: A chop or cut is the defensive, backspin\ncounterpart to the offensive loop drive. A chop\nis essentially a bigger, heavier slice, taken well\nback from the table. Sometimes a defensive\nplayer can impart no spin on the ball during\na chop, or frequently add right- or left-hand\nspin to the ball.

This is not\nas easy as it sounds, because the ball’s spin,\nspeed, and location, all influence the correct\nangle of a block.\n\nd) Side spin drive: The premise of this move is to\nput a spin on the ball either to the right or the\nleft of the racket. The execution of this move\nis similar to a slice, but to the right or left,\ninstead of down. This spin will result in the ball\ncurving to the side but bouncing in the opposite\ndirection when the opponent returns it.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-5.indd 64 8/24/2020 11:38:38 AM\n",

The world’s oldest tennis\ntournament, the Wimbledon Championships were first played\nin London in 1877. The comprehensive rules promulgated\nin 1924 by the International Lawn Tennis Federation, now\nknown as the International Tennis Federation, have remained\nlargely stable, one of the major changes being the addition of\nthe tie-back system. The Davis Cup, an annual competition\nbetween men’s national teams, dates to 1900. The analogous\ncompetition for women’s national teams, the Fed Cup, was\nfounded as the Federation Cup in 1963.

Equipment\n\n(i) Racquets: Tennis racquet must adhere to the\nfollowing guidelines —\n\ne The hitting area, composed of the strings,\nmust be flat and generally uniform.\n\ne The frame of the hitting area may not be more\nthan 29 inches in length and 12.5 inches in\nwidth.\n\ne The entire racquet must be of a fixed shape,\nsize, weight, and weight distribution. There\nmay not be any energy source built into the\nracquet.\n\ne The racquet must not provide any kind of\ncommunication, instruction or advice to the\nplayer during the match.\n\n(ii) Balls: Tennis balls are of hollow rubber with a\nfelt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant\ncolour was gradually changed to optic yellow in\nthe latter part of the 20th century to ensure better\nvisibility.\n\n(iii) Court\n\ne Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface,\nusually grass or clay, a hard court of concrete\nand/or asphalt and occasionally carpet\n(indoor). The court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long,\nand 27 feet (8.23 m) wide for singles matches\nand 36 ft (10.97 m) for doubles’ matches.\n\ne Additional clear space around the court is\nrequired for players so as to reach over run\nballs.\n\ne A net is stretched across the full width of the\ncourt, parallel with the baselines, dividing it\ninto two equal ends. The net is 3 feet 6 inches\n(1.07 m) high at the posts and 3 feet (91.4 cm)\nhigh in the center.\n\n(iv) Lines\n\ne The lines that delineate the width of the court\nare called the baseline (farthest back) and the\nservice line (middle of the court).\n\ne The short mark in the center of each baseline\nis referred to as either the hash mark or the\ncenter mark.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n8/24/2020 11:38:49 AM\n",

The area between\na doubles’ sideline and the nearest singles’\nsideline is called the doubles’ alley, which is\nconsidered playable in doubles’ play.\n\nThe line that runs across the center of a\nplayer’s side of the court is called the service\nline because the serve must be delivered into\nthe area between the service line and the net\non the receiving side.\n\nAll the lines are required to be 2 inches\n(51 mm) in width.

One player is designated as the\nserver, and the opposing player is the receiver.\n\nA tennis match is determined through the\nbest of 3 or 5 sets.

Grip\n\nA grip is a way of holding the racquet in order to hit\nshots during a match. There are three types of grip.\n\ni. Forehand: the tennis forehand is a stroke in\nwhich the inner side of the palm of the dominant\nhand that is holding the racket faces forward. The\nforehand stroke is made by swinging the racket\nacross one’s body in the direction of where one\nwants to land the ball.\n\nii. Backhand: The backhand is a tennis stroke in\nwhich one swings the racquet around one’s body\nwith the back of the hand preceding the palm.\n\niii. The Serve (Service): A serve in tennis is a shot to\nstart a pint. A player will hit the ball with racquet\nso it will fall into the diagonally opposite service\nbox without being stopped by the net.

In order to achieve the best performance, a swimmer\nmust learn to distribute the distance economically and\nthoughtfully throughout the race. Tactics in swimming\nduring different races can be categorised in three different\nphase — (i) Sprint races (ii) Middle distance races (iii) Long\ndistance races\n\nSprint races\n\nThe 50 m race or the sprint race depends on the start,\nmaintaining the speed and a good finish.\n\nMiddle and Long distance races\n\nIn these races, the key word is to build endurance and speed.\nIn middle and long distance races, the swimmer tries to\nprevent building up high oxygen debt. Swimming at a very\nfast pace will accumulate a high level of oxygen debt early\nin the race and will experience an immediate drop in speed.\nSwimmer may sometimes prefer to begin faster than an ideal\npace and attempt to get out in front avoiding the choppy\nwaters.

In team games\na group of individuals in the same team, work together to\nachieve the objective of being the winners of the game. Team\nmembers set points and scores, make decisions, communicate\namong themselves, manage conflicting situations, and solve x\nproblems in a supportive, trusting atmosphere in order to coms\nachieve their objectives. Team games include games, such\n\nas, Basketball, Cricket, Football, Handball, Hockey, Kabaddi,\n\nKho-Kho and Volleyball, etc. In this chapter, we shall discuss\n\nBasketball, Cricket, Football, Hockey and Volleyball.\n\nBASKETBALL\n\nFig. 6.1: Children playing basketball\n\nBasketball is a fast, free-flowing, high-scoring team game.\nThe players shoot a ball through a basket to score points\nwhile following a set of rules. Usually, two teams consist of\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-6.indd 77 8/24/2020 11:39:22 AM\n\n\nfive players on each team. They play on a marked rectangular\ncourt with a basket fixed on each end. Basketball is one of\nthe world’s most popular games.\n\nThe rules allow all players to move freely around the\ncourt and occupy any position. All players have an equal\nopportunity to score a Basket. To play basketball, students\nshould learn and practice the basic skills of dribbling,\npassing, receiving and shooting.\n\nHistory\n\nThe game of basketball originated at the Springfield\nCollege of Physical Education, Massachusetts, USA in\n1891, invented by Dr. James Naismith. In 1894, Naismith\nfixed the first 13 rules which still form the basis of\nmodern basketball. In India, the Young Men’s Christian\nAssociation (YMCA) at Kolkata introduced basketball for\nthe first time. Later the YMCA established at Madras\nin 1920 played an important role in the development of\nthis game. Today basketball is one of the most favourite\ngames in many schools and colleges. The game is played\nby both men and women of all ages and ability. In order\nto promote Basketball at National and International levels\nthe Basketball Federation of India was set up in 1950. The\nfirst National Basketball tournament was held in Delhi in\n1934 and thereafter it was organised every two years until\n1951. After that it started being organised annually.\n\nBasketball court measurements\n\nSl\n=\nle}\n=\nol\nDp\n=\nDp\nio)\n\n18 inch\n\nwide Diameter\n\n~\naH\niS\noO\nzZ\nfe\nE\n5\n5\nfa\nca\n5\nD\n2\nOu\na\nZ\nbr\n=\n5\n\neoly\n\npe}0LI}Ssaq]\n~~\nI Y |\n\nPOAT -TUIag\nas8reyo-0N\n\nsuTTpUG\ndul] aQUaD\n\nFig. 6.2: Basketball court, a basket and a basketball\n\nBasketball is played on a rectangular court, which should\nbe an indoor wooden court or an outdoor concrete court\nhaving two side lines and two end lines. The dimensions\nof basketball court is 28 x15 meters. The court is divided\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-6.indd 78 8/24/2020 11:39:23 AM\n\n\ninto two sections, called half-courts, by the mid-court line,\nwhich is where the game starts with a jump ball. A jump\nball is when a referee throws the ball up at center circle to\ndetermine which team gets possession. Two players from\nopposing teams jump up to tap the ball out of the circle in\norder to gain control over the ball take the game forward. The\nbasketball posts are located at the opposite ends of the court.\n\nRules\nDuration of a Match (Total 4 Quarters)\n\nPlay Rest Play Half time Play Rest\n10 min 2 min 10 min 15 min 10 min 2 min\n\ne The duration of the game of each quarter is ten\nminutes with 2 minutes rest between 1st and 2nd\nquarter and 3rd and 4th quarter, also 15 minutes\nrest between 2nd and 3rd quarter. Extra time period 79\nis of about 5 minutes. Teams exchange the side after\nhalf time. The clock is stopped while the play is not\nactive. Therefore, it takes longer time to complete the\ngame than the allotted time.\n\ne A team must consist of twelve (12) members. But\nonly five players from each team may be on the court\nat one time. Substitutions are unlimited but can only\nbe done when the play is stopped.\n\ne The team with the ball, attempting to score in\ntheir basket is ‘on offense’, the team that prevents\nopposite team from scoring is ‘on defence’. The ball is\nmoved in two ways: either dribbling or by passing to\nteammates. If the ball goes out of the court, the ball\npossession is given to the opposite team.\n\ne For both men’s and women’s teams, a standard\nuniform consists of a pair of shorts and a jersey\nwith a clearly visible bib number, printed on both\nthe front and back. Players should wear appropriate\nshoes that provide extra ankle support.\n\ne The game is controlled by the officials consisting\nof the three (3) referees, out of which one (1) is the\noverall incharge and the other four (4) table officials\nare responsible for keeping other records of each\nteams scoring, timekeeping, individual and team\nfouls, player substitutions, alternating possession\narrow, and stop—and-go-clock, etc.\n\ne The essential equipment in basketball game is the\nball, clocks, score sheets, scoreboard(s), alternating\npossession arrows and other required equipments.\n\ne An attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent\nthrough physical contact is illegal and called a foul.\n\n| SINOdG ANV SAWV WVAL,\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-6.indd 79 8/24/2020 11:39:23 AM\n\n\nPlayers who are fouled either get ball possession or\nare awarded one or two free throws and one point\nis awarded for successfully converting a free throw,\nwhich is attempted from a line 15 feet (4.6 m) from\nthe basket.

In addition, each category comprises of an\nassortment of different variations.\n\ne Man to man defence: Man-to-man defences match\nup the defenders against specific offensive players.\nDefenders are usually assigned to be matched up with\noffensive players by size and ability.\n\ne« Zone Defence: In Zone defence, defenders are assigned\nto guard specific areas on the court. Zones are named\nor designated by their player alignments.\n\n* Combined Defence: A third type of defence that can be\ndeployed is the combination defence. With combina-\ntion defences, some of the players are assigned to play\nman-to-man while the rest of the defenders play zone.\nCombination defences are usually deployed in an effort\nto stop or neutralise great individual offensive players.\n\nae\n4\noO\nzZ\ng\nE\nS\n5\na\nca\né\nw\nFe\nOu\nQ\n2\nbe\n=\n§\n-\n\n82\n\nRebounding\n\nThe objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession\nof the basketball after a missed field point or free throw, as it\nrebounds from the ring or backboard. This plays a major role\nin the game, as most possessions end when a team misses\na shot. There are two categories of rebounds: offensive\nrebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side\nand does not change possession, and defensive rebounds,\nin which the defending team gains possession of the loose\nball. The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team\non defence tends to be in better position to recover missed\nshots.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-6.indd 82 8/24/2020 11:39:26 AM\n\n\nChap-6.indd 83\n\nFig. 6.7: Rebounding\n\nArjun awardees\n\nName of Player\n\nMan Mohan Singh\n\nParminder Singh\n\n6. | Prashanti Singh ND 2017\n\nCRICKET\n\nIntroduction\n\nCricket is a bat and ball game played between two teams\non a field, at the centre of which is a rectangular pitch. One\nteam bats, trying to defend the wicket and scoring as many\nruns as possible. The other team bowls and fields, trying to\ndismiss the batsmen and thus limiting the runs scored by\nthe batting team. A run is scored by the striking batsman\nhitting the ball with his bat, running to the opposite end\nof the pitch and touching the crease there without being\ndismissed. The teams switch between batting and fielding at\nthe end of an inning.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\ng\ns\ng\ns\nisl\n7)\n2\n0\nD\nuv\nie)\nfe\n7)\n\n8/24/2020 11:39:26 AM\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe game of cricket, as it is played today, has its origin in the\nsouth eastern part of England. Cricket became a generally\nadopted sport in the second half of the seventeenth century.\nThe Hambeldon club which was founded in about 1750’s\nhad played a significant part in the evolution of the game.\nIt was superseded by the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C)\nwith its headquarters at Lords, London. Cricket became\nan international game with the formation of the Imperial\nCricket Conference (I.C.C) in 1909. The name of Imperial\nCricket Conference was changed to International Cricket\nConference (later, Council) to enable countries outside the\ncommon wealth to become its members. The first Limited\nOver International cricket match was played in 1971 at\nMelbourne. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC)\nsaw its potential and staged the first limited over Cricket\nWorld Cup in 1975. The first edition of limited over Cricket\nworld cup won by West Indies.\n\nIn the 21st century, a new limited over form, Twenty 20,\nhas made an immediate impact. The first T-20 international\nmatch took place on August 5 2004, between the women’s\nteams of England and New Zealand. The first T-20\ninternational match between men’s teams was played on\nFebruary 17 2005, between Australia and New Zealand. The\nfirst T-20 World Cup was played in South Africa in 2007.\nIndia won the first edition of T-20 World Cup.\n\nAn all India team went on a tour of England in 1911 under\nMaharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala. The Indian Cricket\nControl Board came into being towards the end of 1928. The\nnational championship for the Ranji Trophy began in 1935.\nIndia entered the international arena and played its first official\nTest against England in 1932. Meanwhile Prince Ranjit Singhji\nof Nawanagar who had gone to England for further studies,\nmade a remarkable name for himself in the game of cricket.\n\nHEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION - CLASS X\n\nMeasurement\n84 bn _ om Return Crease\n=\nS i+—_ Stumps\n) + Bowling Crease\n\n<———— Popping Crease\n\n20.12 m (22 yds)\n\nFig. 6.8: Specifications of cricket ground\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-6.indd 84 8/24/2020 11:39:26 AM\n\n\nChap-6.indd 85\n\nWays to score runs\n\nThe aim of the batsmen is to score runs. One of the main\ncricket rules for batsmen to score runs is that they must\nrun to the pitch at each other’s end (from one end to the\nother), hence score one run. Cricket rules state that, they\nmay run multiple runs per shot. As well as while running\nthey can also score runs by hitting boundaries. A batsman\nhits a boundary and scores 4 or 6 runs. A four and six both\nare scored by hitting the ball. If it crosses the boundary\nafter touching the ground it is considered as four and if\nthe ball crosses boundary before touching the ground it is\nconsidered as six. Cricket rules also state that once a 4 or 6\nhas been scored any runs physically scored by the batsman\nby running between the wickets are null and void.\n\nOther ways runs can be scored according to the cricket\nrules include no balls, wide balls, byes and leg byes. Cricket\nrules state that all runs scored by these methods are awarded\nto the batting team but not the individual batters.\n\ne A No Ball can be declared for many reasons: If the\nheel of the bowler’s front foot lands on or in front of\nthe popping crease or if the bowler’s back foot touches\nthen outside the return crease the ball is declared no\nball. If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place,\nthe ball is declared dangerous (often happens when\nbowled at the batsmen’s body on the full), bounces\nmore than twice or rolls before reaching the batsman\nor if fielders are standing in illegal positions. The\nbatsman can hit a No ball and score runs off it but\ncannot be out from a No ball except if they are run\nout, hit the ball twice, handle the ball or obstruct the\nfield. The batsman gains any runs scored off the no\nball for his shot while the team also gains one run for\nthe no ball itself.\n\ne A Wide Ball will be declared if the umpire thinks the\nbatsman did not have a reasonable opportunity to\nscore off the delivery. However if the delivery is bowled\nover the batsmen’s head it will not be declared a wide\nbut a no ball. Umpires are much stricter on wide\ndeliveries in the shorter format of the game while being\nmuch more relaxed in test cricket. A wide delivery will\nadd one run to the batting team and any runs scored\nby the batsman. The batsman is not supposed to be\ndeclared ‘out’ off a wide delivery except if they are\nstumped, run out, handle the ball, hit their wicket or\nobstruct the field.\n\ne A Bye is where a ball that isn’t a no ball or wide passes\nthe striking batsman and runs are scored without the\nbatsman hitting the ball.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\ng\ns\ng\ns\nisl\nwo\n2\n0\nD\nuv\nie}\nfe\n7)\n\n8/24/2020 11:39:26 AM\n\n\n~\naI\niS\noO\nzZ\nQ\n5\n5\nA\nca\n5\nD\n2\nOu\na\nZ\nbn\n=\n‘\n\n| Chap-6.indd 86\n\ne A Leg Bye is where runs are scored by hitting the\nbatsman, but not the bat and the ball is not a no ball\nor wide. However no runs can be scored if the striking\nbatsman didn’t attempt to play a shot or if he was\navoiding the ball.\n\nTypes of ‘out’ in cricket\n\nWays batsmen can be given ‘Out’ according to cricket rules:\nThere are a number of different ways a batsman can be given\nout in the game of cricket. When a bowler gets a batsman\nout it is said that the bowler gets a ‘wicket’. Following are the\ndifferent ways, a batsman can be given out according to the\nrules of cricket:\n\nFig. 6.9: Bowled\n\n¢ Bowled - Cricket rules state that if the ball is bowled\nand hits the striking batsman’s wickets the batsman is\ngiven out (as long as at least one bail is removed by the\nball). It does not matter whether the ball has touched\nthe batsman’s bat, gloves, body or any other part of\nthe batsman. However, the ball is not allowed to have\ntouched another player or umpire before hitting the\nwickets.\n\ne Caught - Cricket rules state that if a batsman while\nplaying the ball, either it touches his bat, hand or glove\nholding the bat then the batsman can be caught out.\nThis is done by the fielders, wicket keeper or bowler\ncatching the ball on the full (before it bounces). If this\nis done then cricket rules state the batsman is out.\n\n¢ Leg before Wicket (LBW) - If the ball is bowled and\n\nhits the .batsman first without touching the bat, then\n\nan LBW decision is possible. However for the umpire to\ngive this out he must first look at some of the factors\nstated in the cricket rules. The first thing the umpire\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n8/24/2020 11:39:28 AM\n\n\nneed to decide is that if is not a no ball, would the ball\nhave hit the wickets if the batsman was not there. If his,\nanswer to this is yes and the ball was not pitched on\nthe leg side of the wicket he can safely give the batsman\nout. However, if the ball hits the batsman outside the\nline of off stump while he was attempting to play a\nstroke then he is not out.\n\ne Stumped - A batsman can be given out according to\ncricket rules when the wicketkeeper puts down his\nwicket while, he is out of his crease and not attempting\na run (if he is attempting a run it would be a run out).\n\n¢ Retired Out - A batsman leaves the field without the\npermission of umpire for any resource like, illness,\ninjury etc. Than is given as retired out.\n\ne Run Out - Cricket rules state that a batsman is out\nif no part of his bat or body is grounded behind the\npopping crease while the ball is in play and the wicket\nis fairly put down by the fielding side.\n\n¢ Hit Wicket - Cricket rules specify that if a batsman\nhits his wicket down with his bat or body after the\nbowler has entered his delivery stride and the ball is in\nplay then he is out.\n¢ Handled the Ball - Cricket rules allow the batsman\nto be given out if he willingly handles the ball with the\nhand that is not touching the bat without the consent\nof the opposition or umpire.\n¢ Timed Out - An incoming batsman must be ready to\nface a ball or be at the non strikers end with his partner\nwithin three minutes of the outgoing batsman being\ndismissed. If this is not done the incoming batsman\ncan be given timed out.\n¢ Hit the Ball Twice - Cricket rules state that ifa\nbatsman hits a ball twice other than for the purpose\nof protecting his wicket or with consent from the\nopposition, he is out.\n¢ Obstructing the Field - A batsman is out if he\nintentionally obstructs the opposition by word or action\nThere are many other cricket rules. However these are\nmost of the basics and will get you well on your way to playing\nthe game. Many of the more advanced rules and laws can be\nlearned along the way and are not vital to general play.\nIfany batsman leaves the field of play without the Umpire’s\nconsent for any reason other than injury or incapacity,\nhe may resume the innings only with the consent of the\nopposing captain. If he fails to resume his innings, he is out.\nFor the purposes of calculating a batting average, retired out\nis considered a dismissal.\n\ng\ns\ng\ns\nisl\nwo\n2\n0\nD\nuv\nie}\nfe\n7)\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-6.indd 87 8/24/2020 11:39:28 AM\n\n\nae\n4\noO\n2\ng\nE\nS\n5\na\nca\ng\nw\nFe\nOu\nQ\n2\nbe\n=\n§\n-\n\n88\n\n| Chap-6.indd 88\n\nNATE\n\nsruaerr\n\nRules\n\ne Cricket is a game played between two teams consisting\nof eleven players each.

The bat is kept angled\nand very close to the front pad to prevent the ball\ngoing through bat and pad.\n\nThe top hand is firm at the top of the handle while the\nbottom hand is relaxed, with the thumb and index\nfinger loosely holding the bat. The back leg should\nbe fully extended with the heel raised off the ground\nbut remaining parallel to the crease.\n\nThe weight of the back foot should be on the inside\nof the right toe and care should be taken not to turn\nit or drag it out of the crease.\n\nThe front foot defensive stroke can be played with\nthe bat slightly behind or in front of the pad depend-\ning on the nature of the wicket and the proficiency\nof the bowler.\n\nOff drive\n\nOff drive is played to an over-pitched ball in line with\nthe off stump or marginally outside.\n\nLike the forward defence, the left shoulder and elbow\nlead the body with the front foot going as close as\npossible to the pitch of the ball. The bat comes down\nin and arc from the top of the back lift and strikes the\nball just in front of the left foot.\n\nAfterimpact, the batmustcontinuein the arcand finish\nover the left shoulder. The follow through can also be\nchecked at shoulder height, keeping the bat face open.\nThe head is kept straight and still throughout the shot\nand the top hand and elbow controls the direction of\nthe shot. At the time of impact the head should be\nover the ball with the body weight balanced on the\nfront foot. The full face of the bat must hit the ball and\non completion, the batsman must be well balanced.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\ng\ns\ng\ns\nisl\nwo\n2\n0\nD\nuv\nie}\nfe\n7)\n\n8/24/2020 11:39:30 AM\n\n\nStraight drive\n\n¢ This shot is played exactly in the same way as an off\ndrive but with the difference is that it is played to a over\npitched ball in and around the line of middle stump\nand the front foot must point down the wicket and the\nbody must be turned slightly and the shoulders opened\nout to allow the free swing of the bat.\n\nOn drive\n\ne On drive is played to a over-pitched ball on and around\nthe leg stump.\n\ne This has been considered to be a difficult shot to play.\nThe basic principles of a drive apply here too, though\nthe swing of the bat is an arc from slips to mid- on\nwith the front pointing down the wicket.\n\ne The front foot should be placed outside the line of ball\nwith the shoulders turned and the impact is just in\nfront of the left toe. The follow through is generally\nchecked below shoulder height.\n\nBack foot defence\n\n¢ The back foot defensive stroke is played to a short-\npitched ball in line with the stumps, which is not\nshort enough to play and attacking shot.\n\ne The back foot is moved back and across to the line\nof the ball with the front naturally following it. The\nbat is brought down close to the body with the head\nsteady and over the ball.\n\ne The back foot must remain parallel to the crease as\nfar as possible to maintain the sideways position of\nthe body with the top hand firm and in control, and\nthe bottom hand holding the bat loosely.\n\ne To keep the bat straight, the left elbow is held high\nnext to the head.

Also commonly known as soccer, it is a game\nthat involves kicking a ball with the foot to score a point.\nIt is played between two teams with a spherical ball on a\nrectangular field of grass or green artificial turf. There is a\ngoal post at each end of the rectangular field and errected\nat the middle of base line. Points are scored by moving the\nball to an opposing team’s end of the field and putting it\nbetween two goal posts. Players are required to move the ball\nby kicking, dribbling, carrying, and passing. The team that\nscores more points than the other by the end of the match\nwins the game.\n\nHistory\n\nAccording to FIFA (Federation International de Football\nAssociation), the “very earliest form of the game was played\nin china during the second and third centuries. The game\nwas later developed in England and the rules of football were\nformulated in India, football began its journey when the\nBritish rulers brought it with them and in no time it became\npopular in the masses. The first recorded game here took place\nbetween the ‘Calcutta Club of Civilians’ and the ‘Gentlemen\nof Barrackpore’ in 1854. The first ever football club in India,\nthe ‘Calcutta Football Club’ was founded in 1872. The first\nfootball association, “the Indian Football Association” (IFA)\nwas established in Calcutta in 1893, though there was no\nIndian on its board till 1930s. It was later, replaced by All India\nFootball Federation (AIFF). The Durand Cup Tournament is\nthe oldest in India and the one of the oldest in the world, was\nstarted in Shimla in 1888. The decade of 1951 to 1962 is\nknown as the golden era in the history of Indian football, as\nthe country put up commendable performances in a number\nof international competitions. India won gold medals in 1951\nand 1962 Asian Games, held at New Delhi and Jakarta.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n68-70 cm\n\nCircumference\nof football\n\nFig. 6.14: Specifications of\nfootball\n\ng\ns\ng\ns\nisl\nwo\n2\n0\nD\nuv\nie}\nfe\n7)\n\n8/24/2020 11:39:32 AM\n\n\nFig. 6.15: Children playing football\n\n90-120m\n\nour] Aemjypey\n\nPenalty Area\n\n45-90m\n\n| 8\nHoa\nag\n°\n\na §\n\nHEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION - CLASS X\n\nFig. 6.16: Specifications of football ground\n\nField measurements\n\nAs per international standard, the length of the rectangular\nfootball field (pitch) is in the range of 100 to 110 m (110 to\n120 yards) and the width is in the range of 65 to 75 m (70\nto 80 yards). There are also goal posts at the back of each\nfootball zone. One way to score is to kick the football through\nthe goal posts.

The\nfootball match is played in two halves of 45 minutes each.\nThere are several rules in the game of football regarding the\nfield, players, penalties, offence and defence.\n\nStart and restart of play\n\nA coin toss takes place before the game starts, the winner of\nthe toss will get the choice of choosing the end to attack. At\nthe kick-off, all players from each side must be in their own\nhalves of the field. The kick-off takes place on the centre spot\nin the centre circle. The player who kicks off cannot touch it\nagain until another player has made contact.\n\nPunishment for offences\n\nIf the player persistently offends during a match, the referee\ncan choose to take action. First the Yellow Card as a caution\nis shown to a player. Any offence after the second one leads\nto Red card. If they showed a red card to a player it means\nthat player is expelled from the match. A straight red card (no\nprevious caution) can be shown for extreme offences, such\nas, serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting, deliberately\nhandling the ball to prevent a goal, a professional foul (denying\na goal scoring opportunity) and insulting language and/or\ngestures.\n\nFree kicks\n\nWhenever a free kick is taken, the players on the opposite\nside must be at least 10 yards away from the ball until it\nis kicked. If this rule is not adhered to, the kick is retaken.\nThere are two types of free kicks awarded, depending on the\nnature of the offence: (i) Direct Free Kick — allows the team\nto take a direct shot at the opponent's goal. (ii) Indirect Free\nKick — a direct strike on goal is not permitted. It means a\nsecond player has to touch the ball after the kick is taken to\nscore a goal.\n\nPenalty kick\n\nA penalty kick is awarded for offences taking place in the\npenalty and goal areas. A nominated member of the team is\nallowed to strike at goal from the penalty spot, with only the\ngoalkeeper to beat. The goalkeeper must remain on his line\nuntil the ball has been kicked, and all other players must be\noutside the penalty area behind the penalty spot.

It\nis delivered on the field of play with both hands and from\nbehind and over the player’s head. Otherwise it is deemed to\nbe a foul throw and a throw-in is given to the opposition. It\ncannot go directly to the goalkeeper’s hands (if on the same\nteam). A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in.\n\nCorner kick\n\nA corner kick is awarded once the whole ball crosses the goal\nline of the opposition, after touching one of their players.\nA kick is taken from the corner of whichever side the ball\ntravelled over the field. Opponents must be 10 yards from\nthe corner arc and the kicker cannot touch the ball a second\ntime without having touched by any other player.\n\nFundamental skills\n\nReceiving\n\nReceiving a ball on the ground is different than receiving a\nball in air. Keep your eye on the ball, select the foot to receive\nthe ball, don’t stop the ball, prepare it for new action or move,\nshot, dribble, pass.\n\nPassing\n\nPassing involves giving the ball to partners. Perfect decision\nmaking is required before a perfect pass. Before pass,\nsee the target, approach the ball, and look at the ball holding\nthe head steady. Strike the correct area of the ball with\nlacked ankle, make sure of follow through and transfer of\nweight forward.\n\n~\naI\niS\noO\n2\niS)\n5\n5\nA\nca\n5\nD\n2\nOu\na\nZ\nbr\n=\n‘\n\nShooting\n\nShooting uses the same elements as used in passing, the\ndifference is that the ball is to be passed to the goal keeper to\nconvert the score for the team. Player should look up to see\nthe position of goal keeper, choosing the area to shoot the\nball while make a proper contact with the ball with proper\nfollow through.\n\nTrapping\nIt is a method of gaining control of the ball.

Now let us discuss a\nfew lead-up activities to develop these techniques.\n\nBall control\n\nFive versus two in 30m x 20m area. Players make two touches\nonly to retain possession of the ball.\n\nDribbling\n\nFour quarters of the area are numbered. One player dribbles\nin one quarter and passes the ball to quarter number 2\nand so on. Reaching last quarter, the player without losing\nthe ball gets points. If ball is lost in any quarter, the other\nteams start anti clockwise and then enter in to the next three\nquarters.\n\nPassing\n\nNumber of players—four. Rectangle measures 5m x 20m or\n10m x 30 m, one ball.\n\nHeading\n\nTwo versus two, Goal of 8 yards, Centre line 5 yards from\neach goal.\n\nShooting\n\nShooting board is a place along the penalty spot, arranged\ninside the penalty area.\n\nTackling\n\nOne versus one, 10m x 10m area, time 2 minutes.\n\nThrow-ins\nThrow-in is a competition between two players.\n\nGoal keeper\n\nA goal keeper also acts as a defence but is allowed to catch\nor touch the ball with hands within the penalty box (D-area).\nA goal keeper is usually the last man standing at the goal to\nprevent opponents from scoring the goal.\n\nArjuna awardees\n\nName of Player\n1 P.K.

However, the name Field Hockey is used in countries\nin which the word Hockey is generally reserved for another\nform of hockey, such as ice hockey or street hockey.\nThe players should learn and practice the basic skills of\ndribbling, passing, tapping and hitting. They should learn\nhow to attack and score goals and how to work with others\nto defend and stop goals from being scored. To do this they\nneed to learn how to keep possession by dribbling effectively\nand moving the ball accurately and quickly between players.\nAs they progress, skills should become more consistent and\nefficient, and the players should be introduced to set play\nsituations.\n\nae\n4\noO\nzZ\ng\nE\nS\n5\na\nca\né\nw\nFe\nOu\nQ\nZ\nbe\n=\n5\n-\n\n98\n\nFig. 6.17: Players playing hockey\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of the game of hockey has its roots well laid in the\nworld’s early civilisations. One of the oldest known sports, the\nhockey game is believed to be in existence about 1200 years\nbefore the Ancient Games of Olympia. Right from Arabs,\nGreeks, Romans, and Persians to Ethiopians, every country\nplayed with a variation of the game. While some played it just\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-6.indd 98 8/24/2020 11:39:36 AM\n\n\nChap-6.indd 99\n\nfor recreation, the others had the opinion that hockey would\nmake them better warriors. Even though many ancient\ncivilisations played hockey in different variations, the modern\ngame of field hockey was developed in the British Isles in the\n19th century. It was introduced in India by the British Army\nregiments and the game soon became popular. It was during\nthis time that the London Hockey Association was formed\nand the rules for playing hockey were standardised. In 1924,\nthe International Hockey Federation (FIH) was founded and\nthree years later, the International Federation of Women’s\nHockey followed.\n\nIn India, the first hockey club came up in Calcutta in\n1885-86 and soon Bombay and Punjab followed. Making\nits Olympic debut at the 1928 Amsterdam Games, Indian\nhockey team won its first Olympic gold, without conceding\na single goal. The hallmark of this ruthless domination was\nthe wizardry of Indian hockey legend, Dhyan Chand, who\nmesmerised the Amsterdam crowd with his dazzling skills.\nFrom 1928 to 1956, India won six consecutive Olympic gold\nmedals, while winning 24 consecutive matches. It was the\ngolden era of Indian hockey, when India produced some of\nthe finest players the game has ever seen.\n\nField measurements\n\n[oy\n\nFig. 6.18: Specification of hockey field\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n55m\n\ng\ns\ng\ns\nisl\nwo\n2\n0\nD\nuv\nie}\nfe\n7)\n\n8/24/2020 11:39:36 AM\n\n\nHockey is played on a 91.40 m x 55 m rectangular field.\nAt each end there is a goal 2.14 m high 1.20 m deep and\n3.66 m wide measured from the inner sides of the posts and\ncrossbar, and the goal post is surrounded by an approximately\nsemi-circular area 14.63 m from the goal bounded by\na solid line. A spot 0.15m in diameter, called the penalty\nspot, is marked with its centre 6.40 m from the centre of\neach goal.\n\nEquipment\n\nEach player carries a stick, normally a little over 3 feet (90\ncentimeters) long, 2 inches wide and traditionally made\nof wood but now often made with fiberglass, Kevlar and\ncarbon fiber composites, with a rounded handle flattening\nout on one side and with a hook at the bottom.\n\nRules\n\nThe rules set by the International Hockey Federation FIH\nare used worldwide.\n\nGeneral play\n\nPrior to the start of the game, a coin is tossed and the\nwinning captain can choose a starting end or start with\nthe ball. The game time is divided into four quarters of 15\nminutes each 15-02-15-10-15-2-15. At the start of each\nquarter as well as after goals are scored, play is started\nwith a pass from the centre of the field.\n\nField players may only play the ball with the flat side\nof the stick. Tackling is permitted as long as the tackler\ndoes not make contact with the attacker or his stick\nbefore playing the ball (contact after the tackle may also\nbe penalised if the tackle was made from a position where\ncontact was inevitable). Further, the player with the ball\nmay not deliberately use his body or stick to shield the\nball from a legitimate tackle.\n\nWhen the ball passes over the sidelines, it is returned to\nplay from sideline either by individual player by himself or\nwith a push or hit, taken by a member of the team whose\nplayers were not the last to touch the ball before crossing\nthe sideline. If it crosses the goal line after last touched\nby an attacker, a 15 mt hit or pass can be made by any\nplayer of the defending team.

        "text": "History\n\nThe game of cricket, as it is played today, has its origin in the\nsouth eastern part of England. Cricket became a generally\nadopted sport in the second half of the seventeenth century.\nThe Hambeldon club which was founded in about 1750’s\nhad played a significant part in the evolution of the game.\nIt was superseded by the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C)\nwith its headquarters at Lords, London. Cricket became\nan international game with the formation of the Imperial\nCricket Conference (I.C.C) in 1909. The name of Imperial\nCricket Conference was changed to International Cricket\nConference (later, Council) to enable countries outside the\ncommon wealth to become its members. The first Limited\nOver International cricket match was played in 1971 at\nMelbourne. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC)\nsaw its potential and staged the first limited over Cricket\nWorld Cup in 1975. The first edition of limited over Cricket\nworld cup won by West Indies.\n\nIn the 21st century, a new limited over form, Twenty 20,\nhas made an immediate impact. The first T-20 international\nmatch took place on August 5 2004, between the women’s\nteams of England and New Zealand. The first T-20\ninternational match between men’s teams was played on\nFebruary 17 2005, between Australia and New Zealand. The\nfirst T-20 World Cup was played in South Africa in 2007.\nIndia won the first edition of T-20 World Cup.\n\nAn all India team went on a tour of England in 1911 under\nMaharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala. The Indian Cricket\nControl Board came into being towards the end of 1928. The\nnational championship for the Ranji Trophy began in 1935.\nIndia entered the international arena and played its first official\nTest against England in 1932. Meanwhile Prince Ranjit Singhji\nof Nawanagar who had gone to England for further studies,\nmade a remarkable name for himself in the game of cricket.\n\nHEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION - CLASS X\n\nMeasurement\n84 bn _ om Return Crease\n=\nS i+—_ Stumps\n) + Bowling Crease\n\n<———— Popping Crease\n\n20.12 m (22 yds)\n\nFig. 6.8: Specifications of cricket ground\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-6.indd 84 8/24/2020 11:39:26 AM\n",

One of the main\ncricket rules for batsmen to score runs is that they must\nrun to the pitch at each other’s end (from one end to the\nother), hence score one run. Cricket rules state that, they\nmay run multiple runs per shot. As well as while running\nthey can also score runs by hitting boundaries. A batsman\nhits a boundary and scores 4 or 6 runs. A four and six both\nare scored by hitting the ball. If it crosses the boundary\nafter touching the ground it is considered as four and if\nthe ball crosses boundary before touching the ground it is\nconsidered as six. Cricket rules also state that once a 4 or 6\nhas been scored any runs physically scored by the batsman\nby running between the wickets are null and void.\n\nOther ways runs can be scored according to the cricket\nrules include no balls, wide balls, byes and leg byes. Cricket\nrules state that all runs scored by these methods are awarded\nto the batting team but not the individual batters.\n\ne A No Ball can be declared for many reasons: If the\nheel of the bowler’s front foot lands on or in front of\nthe popping crease or if the bowler’s back foot touches\nthen outside the return crease the ball is declared no\nball. If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place,\nthe ball is declared dangerous (often happens when\nbowled at the batsmen’s body on the full), bounces\nmore than twice or rolls before reaching the batsman\nor if fielders are standing in illegal positions. The\nbatsman can hit a No ball and score runs off it but\ncannot be out from a No ball except if they are run\nout, hit the ball twice, handle the ball or obstruct the\nfield. The batsman gains any runs scored off the no\nball for his shot while the team also gains one run for\nthe no ball itself.\n\ne A Wide Ball will be declared if the umpire thinks the\nbatsman did not have a reasonable opportunity to\nscore off the delivery. However if the delivery is bowled\nover the batsmen’s head it will not be declared a wide\nbut a no ball. Umpires are much stricter on wide\ndeliveries in the shorter format of the game while being\nmuch more relaxed in test cricket. A wide delivery will\nadd one run to the batting team and any runs scored\nby the batsman. The batsman is not supposed to be\ndeclared ‘out’ off a wide delivery except if they are\nstumped, run out, handle the ball, hit their wicket or\nobstruct the field.\n\ne A Bye is where a ball that isn’t a no ball or wide passes\nthe striking batsman and runs are scored without the\nbatsman hitting the ball.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\ng\ns\ng\ns\nisl\nwo\n2\n0\nD\nuv\nie}\nfe\n7)\n\n8/24/2020 11:39:26 AM\n",

However no runs can be scored if the striking\nbatsman didn’t attempt to play a shot or if he was\navoiding the ball.\n\nTypes of ‘out’ in cricket\n\nWays batsmen can be given ‘Out’ according to cricket rules:\nThere are a number of different ways a batsman can be given\nout in the game of cricket. When a bowler gets a batsman\nout it is said that the bowler gets a ‘wicket’. Following are the\ndifferent ways, a batsman can be given out according to the\nrules of cricket:\n\nFig. 6.9: Bowled\n\n¢ Bowled - Cricket rules state that if the ball is bowled\nand hits the striking batsman’s wickets the batsman is\ngiven out (as long as at least one bail is removed by the\nball). It does not matter whether the ball has touched\nthe batsman’s bat, gloves, body or any other part of\nthe batsman. However, the ball is not allowed to have\ntouched another player or umpire before hitting the\nwickets.\n\ne Caught - Cricket rules state that if a batsman while\nplaying the ball, either it touches his bat, hand or glove\nholding the bat then the batsman can be caught out.\nThis is done by the fielders, wicket keeper or bowler\ncatching the ball on the full (before it bounces). If this\nis done then cricket rules state the batsman is out.\n\n¢ Leg before Wicket (LBW) - If the ball is bowled and\n\nhits the .batsman first without touching the bat, then\n\nan LBW decision is possible. However for the umpire to\ngive this out he must first look at some of the factors\nstated in the cricket rules. The first thing the umpire\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n8/24/2020 11:39:28 AM\n",

However, if the ball hits the batsman outside the\nline of off stump while he was attempting to play a\nstroke then he is not out.\n\ne Stumped - A batsman can be given out according to\ncricket rules when the wicketkeeper puts down his\nwicket while, he is out of his crease and not attempting\na run (if he is attempting a run it would be a run out).\n\n¢ Retired Out - A batsman leaves the field without the\npermission of umpire for any resource like, illness,\ninjury etc. Than is given as retired out.\n\ne Run Out - Cricket rules state that a batsman is out\nif no part of his bat or body is grounded behind the\npopping crease while the ball is in play and the wicket\nis fairly put down by the fielding side.\n\n¢ Hit Wicket - Cricket rules specify that if a batsman\nhits his wicket down with his bat or body after the\nbowler has entered his delivery stride and the ball is in\nplay then he is out.\n¢ Handled the Ball - Cricket rules allow the batsman\nto be given out if he willingly handles the ball with the\nhand that is not touching the bat without the consent\nof the opposition or umpire.\n¢ Timed Out - An incoming batsman must be ready to\nface a ball or be at the non strikers end with his partner\nwithin three minutes of the outgoing batsman being\ndismissed. If this is not done the incoming batsman\ncan be given timed out.\n¢ Hit the Ball Twice - Cricket rules state that ifa\nbatsman hits a ball twice other than for the purpose\nof protecting his wicket or with consent from the\nopposition, he is out.\n¢ Obstructing the Field - A batsman is out if he\nintentionally obstructs the opposition by word or action\nThere are many other cricket rules. However these are\nmost of the basics and will get you well on your way to playing\nthe game. Many of the more advanced rules and laws can be\nlearned along the way and are not vital to general play.\nIfany batsman leaves the field of play without the Umpire’s\nconsent for any reason other than injury or incapacity,\nhe may resume the innings only with the consent of the\nopposing captain. If he fails to resume his innings, he is out.\nFor the purposes of calculating a batting average, retired out\nis considered a dismissal.\n\ng\ns\ng\ns\nisl\nwo\n2\n0\nD\nuv\nie}\nfe\n7)\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-6.indd 87 8/24/2020 11:39:28 AM\n",

Also commonly known as soccer, it is a game\nthat involves kicking a ball with the foot to score a point.\nIt is played between two teams with a spherical ball on a\nrectangular field of grass or green artificial turf. There is a\ngoal post at each end of the rectangular field and errected\nat the middle of base line. Points are scored by moving the\nball to an opposing team’s end of the field and putting it\nbetween two goal posts. Players are required to move the ball\nby kicking, dribbling, carrying, and passing. The team that\nscores more points than the other by the end of the match\nwins the game.\n\nHistory\n\nAccording to FIFA (Federation International de Football\nAssociation), the “very earliest form of the game was played\nin china during the second and third centuries. The game\nwas later developed in England and the rules of football were\nformulated in India, football began its journey when the\nBritish rulers brought it with them and in no time it became\npopular in the masses. The first recorded game here took place\nbetween the ‘Calcutta Club of Civilians’ and the ‘Gentlemen\nof Barrackpore’ in 1854. The first ever football club in India,\nthe ‘Calcutta Football Club’ was founded in 1872. The first\nfootball association, “the Indian Football Association” (IFA)\nwas established in Calcutta in 1893, though there was no\nIndian on its board till 1930s. It was later, replaced by All India\nFootball Federation (AIFF). The Durand Cup Tournament is\nthe oldest in India and the one of the oldest in the world, was\nstarted in Shimla in 1888. The decade of 1951 to 1962 is\nknown as the golden era in the history of Indian football, as\nthe country put up commendable performances in a number\nof international competitions. India won gold medals in 1951\nand 1962 Asian Games, held at New Delhi and Jakarta.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n68-70 cm\n\nCircumference\nof football\n\nFig. 6.14: Specifications of\nfootball\n\ng\ns\ng\ns\nisl\nwo\n2\n0\nD\nuv\nie}\nfe\n7)\n\n8/24/2020 11:39:32 AM\n",

The\nfootball match is played in two halves of 45 minutes each.\nThere are several rules in the game of football regarding the\nfield, players, penalties, offence and defence.\n\nStart and restart of play\n\nA coin toss takes place before the game starts, the winner of\nthe toss will get the choice of choosing the end to attack. At\nthe kick-off, all players from each side must be in their own\nhalves of the field. The kick-off takes place on the centre spot\nin the centre circle. The player who kicks off cannot touch it\nagain until another player has made contact.\n\nPunishment for offences\n\nIf the player persistently offends during a match, the referee\ncan choose to take action. First the Yellow Card as a caution\nis shown to a player. Any offence after the second one leads\nto Red card. If they showed a red card to a player it means\nthat player is expelled from the match. A straight red card (no\nprevious caution) can be shown for extreme offences, such\nas, serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting, deliberately\nhandling the ball to prevent a goal, a professional foul (denying\na goal scoring opportunity) and insulting language and/or\ngestures.\n\nFree kicks\n\nWhenever a free kick is taken, the players on the opposite\nside must be at least 10 yards away from the ball until it\nis kicked. If this rule is not adhered to, the kick is retaken.\nThere are two types of free kicks awarded, depending on the\nnature of the offence: (i) Direct Free Kick — allows the team\nto take a direct shot at the opponent's goal. (ii) Indirect Free\nKick — a direct strike on goal is not permitted. It means a\nsecond player has to touch the ball after the kick is taken to\nscore a goal.\n\nPenalty kick\n\nA penalty kick is awarded for offences taking place in the\npenalty and goal areas. A nominated member of the team is\nallowed to strike at goal from the penalty spot, with only the\ngoalkeeper to beat. The goalkeeper must remain on his line\nuntil the ball has been kicked, and all other players must be\noutside the penalty area behind the penalty spot.

It\nis delivered on the field of play with both hands and from\nbehind and over the player’s head. Otherwise it is deemed to\nbe a foul throw and a throw-in is given to the opposition. It\ncannot go directly to the goalkeeper’s hands (if on the same\nteam). A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in.\n\nCorner kick\n\nA corner kick is awarded once the whole ball crosses the goal\nline of the opposition, after touching one of their players.\nA kick is taken from the corner of whichever side the ball\ntravelled over the field. Opponents must be 10 yards from\nthe corner arc and the kicker cannot touch the ball a second\ntime without having touched by any other player.\n\nFundamental skills\n\nReceiving\n\nReceiving a ball on the ground is different than receiving a\nball in air.

Even though many ancient\ncivilisations played hockey in different variations, the modern\ngame of field hockey was developed in the British Isles in the\n19th century. It was introduced in India by the British Army\nregiments and the game soon became popular. It was during\nthis time that the London Hockey Association was formed\nand the rules for playing hockey were standardised. In 1924,\nthe International Hockey Federation (FIH) was founded and\nthree years later, the International Federation of Women’s\nHockey followed.\n\nIn India, the first hockey club came up in Calcutta in\n1885-86 and soon Bombay and Punjab followed. Making\nits Olympic debut at the 1928 Amsterdam Games, Indian\nhockey team won its first Olympic gold, without conceding\na single goal. The hallmark of this ruthless domination was\nthe wizardry of Indian hockey legend, Dhyan Chand, who\nmesmerised the Amsterdam crowd with his dazzling skills.\nFrom 1928 to 1956, India won six consecutive Olympic gold\nmedals, while winning 24 consecutive matches.

Each team works together\nto hit an inflated ball over a high net. Each team tries to\nscore points by grounding the ball on the other team’s court.\nVolleyball is a rebound game where one cannot hold or catch\nthe ball; every contact must be a rebound action. It is essential\nfor the player to be in the right place at the right time if\nthe game is to be played in a controlled manner. Therefore,\ngood anticipation and movement skills should be taught\nto players. At competency level, students should learn and\npractice the basic skills of sending and receiving the ball over\na high net.

The idea of using a net\nwas borrowed from tennis. It was raised to a height above\nthe average man’s height. During a demonstration game,\nsomeone remarked that the players seemed to be volleying\nthe ball back and forth over the net, and perhaps “volleyball”\nwould be a more descriptive name for the sport. The game\nof Volleyball was invented by William G. Morgan in the year\n1895 in Holyoke, Massachusetts by YMCA (USA). It was\ninvented as a recreational game.

This game is popular in\nthe villages and small towns in India. It is played throughout\nAsia with minor modifications. Kabaddi is quite new to the\nother parts of the world. It was known by various names in\ndifferent parts of India. For example, Chedugudu or Gudu-\ngudu in Southern parts of India, Ha-du-du (Men), Chu-kit-\nkit (Women) in Eastern India, Hu-tu-tu in Maharashtra in\nwestern India and Kabaddi in Northern India. It is a game of\nattack and defense. The two teams occupy opposite halves\nof a field and take turn in sending a ‘Raider’ into the other\nhalf. In order to win points, members of the opposite team\nare tagged and the raider tries to return to half, holding the\nbreath and chanting, “Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi”.\n\nFig. 7.1: Children playing kabaddi\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n1077CHO7\n\n8/24/2020 11:41:01 AM\n\n\nHistory\n\nAccording to some historians Kabaddi might have developed\nduring prehistoric times when human beings were forced\nto defend themselves from sudden attacks from ferocious\nbeasts. There is also another school of thought, in India,\nwhich believes that this game is a version of Chakravyuha,\nused in Mahabharata. The game was demonstrated for the\nfirst time at the international level during 1936 in Berlin\nOlympics by Hanuman Vyayam Pracharak Mandal, Amravati,\nMaharashtra. The game was introduced in the Indian Olympic\nGames at Calcutta in 1938.\n\nIn 1950, the All India Kabaddi Federation came into\nexistence and compiled standard rules. The Amateur Kabaddi\nFederation of India (AKFI) was founded in 1973. After\nformation of the AKFI, the first men’s nationals were held in\nMadras (Chennai), while the women’s were held in Calcutta\n(Kolkata) in 1955. The Asian Kabaddi Federation (AKF) was\nfounded in 1978. AKF is affiliated to Olympic Council of\nAsia. The parent body designated to regulate the game at\n\nbd the international level is International Kabaddi Federation\ng (IKF). The Kabaddi World Cup was first played in 2004, then\n\na in 2007 and 2010. So far India is the unbeaten champion\nin Kabaddi World Cup.

Traditionally\nthe game is played outdoors and the entire court is dug at\nleast 1 foot deep. The mud is removed and filled with sand\nfrom the river or beach. This ensures that the player is not\nseriously injured if he falls or is dragged by opponents.\nHowever, now synthetic Kabaddi fields are used for comfort\nand to reduce injuries.

The skills used by the antis are called defensive skills.\nDuring a raid, the raider has to make maximum use of his\nlimbs to come in contact or touch the opponents in order to\nscore points. This is accomplished through leg touches, such\nas, toe touch, foot touch, squat leg, thrust, kicks, etc., with\nlower limbs and through hand touches with upper limbs.\n\nOffensive skills\n\na) Touch: Touch is a fundamental and the easiest\nskill, which every raider applies in one or the\nother forms. There are different kinds of touches\nsuch as —\n\n(i) Hand touch: (a) running hand _ touch\n(b) stooping hand touch (c) turning hand-touch\n(d) hopping hand touch (e) fake and touch\n\n(ii) Toe touch: This offensive skill is used by\nalmost every raider. A raider can execute this\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\ng\ns\ng\ns\nisl\n7)\n2\n0\nD\nuv\nie}\nfe\n7)\n\n8/24/2020 11:41:01 AM\n\n\nHEALTH AND PuysicAL Epucation - CLass X\n\n| Chap-7.indd 116\n\nskill even from a considerable distance from\nthe anties. During the course of a raid, the\nraider will move in different angles, according\nto the positions and moves of the opponents.\nAt the same time, in order to apply this skill,\nthe raider requires to extend his leg towards\nthe opponent suddenly.\n\n(iii) Foot touch: The modern toe touch is a\nmoderate form of foot-touch. The major\ndifference between these two skills is that\nin foot-touch, the raider tries to touch the\nopponents with complete foot whereas in toe\ntouch, toe is used to touch the opponents.\nThis skill helps the raider to cover more\narea in the opponent’s court and has an\nadvantage over toe touch.\n\nb) Mule kick: It is very useful in critical situations.\nMule kick is a thrust or blow in the air, by the\nraider, with leg, to touch an anti. There are various\ntypes of kicks, such as —\n\ni. Back kick: Kicking the anti who comes behind\nthe raider during the course of raid is known\nas back kick. The different forms of back kick\nare: (i) running back kick (ii) standing back\nkick (iii) fake and kick (iv) taking a turn and\nback kick.\n\nii. Side kick: Raiders who raid from second to\nsecond and attack the central zone will find\nthis skill the most suitable. The method and\nprinciple of kick are the same as in the case\nof back kick. The only difference between\nthe two is that the area to be covered is\nsideward.\n\niii. Curve kick is also called a mule kick as the\nleg lifted to kick at the anties takes a curve\nfrom back to the side. This type of kick will\nenable the raider to cover more area with the\nattacking leg. At the same time it enables the\nraider to change his direction.\n\nDefensive skills\n\na) Ankle hold: This is a counter skill used by\ndefensive players against leg thrusts and foot\ntouches during an attack or raid. A team, which\nhas mastery over ankle hold, can plan different\nstrategies and tactics in various situations, such\nas, (a) lifting up (b) pulling back (c) changing\ndirection of the raider.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n8/24/2020 11:41:01 AM\n\n\nChap-7.indd 117\n\nb) Thigh hold: This skill is a good defensive skill.\nEvery team uses this technique as a planned\nand surprise tactic. For example: (a) Taking one\nstep forward and hold — Taking one step forward\nmeans holding the raider’s thigh on wrong step or\nrear leg (b) thigh hold from behind.\n\nWaist hold or trunk hold: Waist hold is a skill used\nby a defender to catch the raider from behind.\nWrist hold: Wrist hold is also a defensive skill and\nused occasionally only when a situation presents\nitself. This hold is rarely used now a days.\n\nCc\n\n—\n\nd\n\n—\n\ne€\n\n—\n\nBlocking: It is a defensive skill used by covers\nand corners. Blocking is an act of creating a\nwall of obstruction in the path of the raider to\nprevent the movement. The aim of blocking is not\njust to obstruct the path, but also to catch\nthe raider.\n\nTactics\n\nTactics means exploiting a given situation to one’s advantage.\nThis is also done to create a situation to suit one’s purpose.\nThe raider may increase or decrease the tempo of the game\ndepending on the situation. In order to do this the player\nmay adopt a passive raid or an aggressive raid by creating a\nsituation for a struggle. Sometimes the raider may pass time\nin the last few minutes of the game, especially when the team\nis leading and the opponents are playing an aggressive game.\nKeeping in view the game situation, different tactics adopted\nby the raider.\n\nRetreat\n\nUnless the raider returns to home court safely after the raid,\nthe raid cannot be treated as successful. This is called a\nretreat. The raider has to pre-plan the path of retreat before\nstarting the raid. While retreating to home court, the raider\nshould keep the following points in view —\ne The raider does not give room for pursuit.\ne The raider regains their defensive position quickly\nbefore the opponent team’s raider begins the raid.\ne While returning to home court, the raider must pass\nonly through the midline.\n\nRaid\n\nRaid is the offence part of the game. The main feature of\nthe game is raiding on the opponent’s court, alternatively by\nboth the team players. The defence is done with teamwork\nwhile only one player makes an attack.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\ng\ns\ng\ns\nisl\nwo\n2\n0\nD\nuv\nie}\nfe\n7)\n\n8/24/2020 11:41:01 AM\n\n\nCant\n\n‘Cant’ is holding of breath by the raider during the attack\nand chanting the word kabaddi, kabaddi, respectively, in one\nsingle expiration.\n\nKuo-KHo\n\nKho-Kho is one of the most popular traditional team sport in\nIndia. Itis the simplest form of chasing and touching a person.\nItis an inexpensive and enjoyable sport that demands physical\nfitness and a set of skills. Dodging, feigning and bursts of\ncontrolled speed make this game quite thrilling. To catch by\npursuit is to chase, rather than just run — is the main skill\nof Kho-Kho. This game is played in two innings by two teams\non a rectangular court. One team becomes the chasers and\nthe other the runners. In the game, the chaser pursues the\nrunners and touches them and puts them out. Each team\nhas to chase and defend for 9 minutes twice in a match.\n\nFig. 7.3: Player playing kho-kho\n\nHistory\nIn the ancient era, a version of the Kho-Kho game was played\non ‘raths’ or chariots in Maharashtra, and this was known\nas Rathera. The Kho-Kho rules were first framed in the early\n1900’s. A committee was formed at Puna Gymkhana in 1914\nfor framing the Kho-Kho rules and the first ever book of Kho-\nKho rules was published from Baroda Gymkhana in 1924.\nThe year 1936 was the year of the golden opportunity for the\ngame of Kho-Kho when Berlin Olympic Games featured an\nexhibition of Kho-Kho in the main stadium. The Hanuman\nVyayam Prasarak Mandal of Amravati was the proud\ndemonstrators in that exhibition.\n\nThe first ever All India Kho-Kho Championships were\norganised at Vijaywada in 1959-60 under the auspices of\nKho-Kho Federation of India.

In the term judo, ‘ju’ means\n‘gentle’ and ‘do’ means ‘the way or path’.\nJudo was developed in Japan in the late 19th\ncentury by using the principles of balance and\nleverage adapted from jujutsu. Its most prominent\nfeature is its competitive element, where the\nobjective is to either throw or putdown one’s\nopponent to the ground, immobilise or otherwise\nsubdue one’s opponent with a grappling maneuver,\nor force an opponent to submit by joint locking or\nby executing a stranglehold or choke. Strikes and\nthrusts by hands and feet as well as self-defense\nare a part of judo. Many are trained in Judo either\nfor participation in competition or self-defense.\n\nFig. 7.5: Player playing Judo\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of judo starts with Japanese jujutsu. It was\ncreated by Professor Jigoro Kano and he believed that the\ntechniques could be practiced as a competitive sport if the\nmore dangerous techniques were omitted. By 1910 Judo was\na recognised sport that could be safely engaged in and in\n1911 it was adopted as a part of Japan’s educational system.\nIn the same year, the Kodokan Judo Instructors’ Training\nDepartment, Kodokan Black Belt Association and Japan\nAthletic Association were formed. World War II saw a different\ndevelopment of Judo. Instead of being used for sport, Judo was\nbeing taught as a combat skill. Those selected for commando\nand special services training often achieved a high standard\nof expertise. When Japan hosted the 1964 Olympics, Judo\nwas given its first opportunity as an event. Of the 16 medals\nawarded for Judo, Japan won three gold medals, and one\nsilver medal. Judo was no longer a Japanese sport but had\ndeveloped to become an international sport.\n\nThere have been two main developments in Judo over the\nyears. The first was the introduction of weight categories.\nEarlier everyone fought everyone else, with the result that,\nif two players were equally matched in skill, the bigger man\nusually won. Initially there were three categories, and later\nthis was made into five. Inclusion of the sport in the Olympic\nGames in 1964 helped to hasten this important reform.\nThere are different styles of Judo. With its inclusion in the\nOlympics, there has been a shift towards a contest style\npractice. In clubs where this style is taught, the practice\nbecomes largely a continuous contest. Other schools stress\non skills. They favour repetitive movements to make them\ninstinctive and the development of speed through practice\nwith little resistance.\n\nHEALTH AND PuysicAL Epucation - CLass X\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-7.indd 122 8/24/2020 11:41:04 AM\n\n\nChap-7.indd 123\n\nRules\n\nOfficials\n\nThere are three officials who preside over a judo match. There\nis one referee who walks around inside the contest area and\nconducts the match. There are two judges who sit diagonally\nacross the mat from one another, each in a corner. The two\njudges assist the referee and indicate when the contestant\ngoes outside of the contest area. The referee is in charge\nof awarding points and accessing penalties and uses hand\ngestures to signal his decision. However, if a judge disagrees\nwith a call, then the three officials take a vote and the decision\nis decided by a majority vote. In addition to the Judge and\nReferees there are also scorekeepers and timers. There is\nusually a scoreboard, which displays points and penalties\nand it can either be electronic or manual. Medical personnel\nare also on hand in the event of injury to a contestant.\n\nContestants\n\nThe two contestants, who are known as Judokas, compete for\n5 minutes for men and 4 minutes for women. One contestant\nwears white uniform and the other a blue uniform.\n\nUniforms\n\nThe judokas wear loose-fitting judo uniforms called judogi,\nconsisting of pants, a jacket and a belt. Judogi is made up\nof loose-fitting pants, a jacket and a belt that is tied around\nthe waist. The jacket and pants are made of cotton. They\nare either blue or white and they are made so a rival should\nbe able to get a grip on either one of them so as to be able\nto make a judo throw. One judoka will wear white the other\nblue. The belt is three meters long and it is wrapped around\nthe waist twice. The color of the belt signifies the rank the\ncombatant has reached.\n\nCompetition area\n\nThe entire competition area in judo is 46 to 53 feet square\n(14 to 16 meters). This area is made up of foam mats\ncommonly referred to as tatami mats and the individual\nmats are 6.5 feet by 3.281 feet wide (2 meters long, a 1-meter\nwide). Inside the competition area is a contest area, which\nis 8-10 meters square. This contest area (shiaijo) is green in\ncolor, that would be 29.5 feet square (9-meters) and it will\nhave a 3.281 foot (1-meter) red boundary around it. This is\nthe danger zone and it alerts the competitor(s) (judoka) that\nthey are about to go out of bounds. The area outside the\ndanger zone is the safety zone. This zone is three meters wide\nand it is the out-of-bounds area.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\ng\ns\ng\ns\nisl\nwo\n2\n0\nD\nuv\nie}\nfe\n7)\n\n8/24/2020 11:41:04 AM\n\n\nIn the middle of the contest area are two pieces of tape,\none blue and one white 13.1 feet apart (4-meters). These two\npieces of tape mark the place where the judoka will stand\nwhen they begin and end each bout.\n\nContest\n\nA random draw, in the same weight category, is used to\ndetermine which contestants will be fighting each other. In\nWhat is the proficiency the Olympic Games there are two pools, and each pool has\ngiven in India? Make a its own single-elimination tournament. The two pool winners\n\nBist, will compete for the gold medal, with the loser of this contest\nfa Yellow belt or Black inning the silver medal. In each pool, the competitors who\nelt.\n\nlose to a pool winner are then entered into a repechage round\nwhich is also a single-elimination tournament. The winners of\nthe repechage pools will be the winners of the bronze medals.\n\nTo win the contest a Judoka must score an Ippon a score\nthat equals 10 points by using successful Judo techniques.\nIf neither of the Judokas is able to score an Ippon or 10\npoints by the end of the match, the winner will be the Judoka\nwho has scored the most points. In the event of a tie, for the\nfirst time at the 2004 Olympic Games, the “Golden Score”\nrule was used. If there is no winner after the five-minute\nperiod has ended, the referee announces the beginning of\n“Golden Score”. This will extend the match for an extra five-\nminute period and the contestant who scores the first point\nis declared the winner of the match.\n\nJudo penalties\n\nTwo types of penalties may be awarded. One is shido and\nanother is hansoku. After two shido are given, the third\nshido becomes hansoku-make and the victory is given to the\nopponent.

In India also it received regular patronage from the\nEmperors and Kings. Wrestling in India then was popularly\nknown as Malla Yuddha. In famous Indian epic, Mahabharata,\nBhima was considered to be a great wrestler of that time\nand some of the other great wrestlers included Jarasandha,\nDuryodhana, and Karna. Another Indian epic, Ramayana\nalso mentions about wrestling and Hanuman is described\nas one of the great wrestlers of that time. Wrestling in India\ncontinued to increase its popularity during modern days. Even\nduring the British rule, wrestling in India got encouraging\nsupport, as the British rulers included the game into the\nmilitary practice. In fact, India was considered among the\ntop 10 countries in wrestling till the 1960s. India also hosted\nthe World Wrestling Championship at New Delhi in 1967.\nThe term Kushti, which means wrestling, denotes both a\nlocal form of the art as well as a more global combat. Kushti\nis composed of three primary dimensions: dao, pench, and\npaintra (moves, counter-moves, and stance). There may\nbe similarities between the daos known as multani, dhobi\npat, and kalajangh and the corresponding freestyle moves\nknown as arm drag, front hip throw, and fireman carry. But\nwhat is significantly different about wrestling in India is\nthat wrestlers mostly wrestle in mud pits, engage in bouts\nthat last for half an hour or more.

This game is popular in\nthe villages and small towns in India. It is played throughout\nAsia with minor modifications. Kabaddi is quite new to the\nother parts of the world. It was known by various names in\ndifferent parts of India. For example, Chedugudu or Gudu-\ngudu in Southern parts of India, Ha-du-du (Men), Chu-kit-\nkit (Women) in Eastern India, Hu-tu-tu in Maharashtra in\nwestern India and Kabaddi in Northern India. It is a game of\nattack and defense. The two teams occupy opposite halves\nof a field and take turn in sending a ‘Raider’ into the other\nhalf. In order to win points, members of the opposite team\nare tagged and the raider tries to return to half, holding the\nbreath and chanting, “Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi”.\n\nFig. 7.1: Children playing kabaddi\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n1077CHO7\n\n8/24/2020 11:41:01 AM\n",

        "text": "History\n\nAccording to some historians Kabaddi might have developed\nduring prehistoric times when human beings were forced\nto defend themselves from sudden attacks from ferocious\nbeasts. There is also another school of thought, in India,\nwhich believes that this game is a version of Chakravyuha,\nused in Mahabharata. The game was demonstrated for the\nfirst time at the international level during 1936 in Berlin\nOlympics by Hanuman Vyayam Pracharak Mandal, Amravati,\nMaharashtra. The game was introduced in the Indian Olympic\nGames at Calcutta in 1938.\n\nIn 1950, the All India Kabaddi Federation came into\nexistence and compiled standard rules. The Amateur Kabaddi\nFederation of India (AKFI) was founded in 1973. After\nformation of the AKFI, the first men’s nationals were held in\nMadras (Chennai), while the women’s were held in Calcutta\n(Kolkata) in 1955. The Asian Kabaddi Federation (AKF) was\nfounded in 1978. AKF is affiliated to Olympic Council of\nAsia. The parent body designated to regulate the game at\n\nbd the international level is International Kabaddi Federation\ng (IKF). The Kabaddi World Cup was first played in 2004, then\n\na in 2007 and 2010. So far India is the unbeaten champion\nin Kabaddi World Cup.

The skills used by the antis are called defensive skills.\nDuring a raid, the raider has to make maximum use of his\nlimbs to come in contact or touch the opponents in order to\nscore points. This is accomplished through leg touches, such\nas, toe touch, foot touch, squat leg, thrust, kicks, etc., with\nlower limbs and through hand touches with upper limbs.\n\nOffensive skills\n\na) Touch: Touch is a fundamental and the easiest\nskill, which every raider applies in one or the\nother forms. There are different kinds of touches\nsuch as —\n\n(i) Hand touch: (a) running hand _ touch\n(b) stooping hand touch (c) turning hand-touch\n(d) hopping hand touch (e) fake and touch\n\n(ii) Toe touch: This offensive skill is used by\nalmost every raider.

During the course of a raid, the\nraider will move in different angles, according\nto the positions and moves of the opponents.\nAt the same time, in order to apply this skill,\nthe raider requires to extend his leg towards\nthe opponent suddenly.\n\n(iii) Foot touch: The modern toe touch is a\nmoderate form of foot-touch. The major\ndifference between these two skills is that\nin foot-touch, the raider tries to touch the\nopponents with complete foot whereas in toe\ntouch, toe is used to touch the opponents.\nThis skill helps the raider to cover more\narea in the opponent’s court and has an\nadvantage over toe touch.\n\nb) Mule kick: It is very useful in critical situations.\nMule kick is a thrust or blow in the air, by the\nraider, with leg, to touch an anti. There are various\ntypes of kicks, such as —\n\ni. Back kick: Kicking the anti who comes behind\nthe raider during the course of raid is known\nas back kick. The different forms of back kick\nare: (i) running back kick (ii) standing back\nkick (iii) fake and kick (iv) taking a turn and\nback kick.\n\nii. Side kick: Raiders who raid from second to\nsecond and attack the central zone will find\nthis skill the most suitable. The method and\nprinciple of kick are the same as in the case\nof back kick. The only difference between\nthe two is that the area to be covered is\nsideward.\n\niii. Curve kick is also called a mule kick as the\nleg lifted to kick at the anties takes a curve\nfrom back to the side. This type of kick will\nenable the raider to cover more area with the\nattacking leg. At the same time it enables the\nraider to change his direction.\n\nDefensive skills\n\na) Ankle hold: This is a counter skill used by\ndefensive players against leg thrusts and foot\ntouches during an attack or raid. A team, which\nhas mastery over ankle hold, can plan different\nstrategies and tactics in various situations, such\nas, (a) lifting up (b) pulling back (c) changing\ndirection of the raider.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n8/24/2020 11:41:01 AM\n",

For example: (a) Taking one\nstep forward and hold — Taking one step forward\nmeans holding the raider’s thigh on wrong step or\nrear leg (b) thigh hold from behind.\n\nWaist hold or trunk hold: Waist hold is a skill used\nby a defender to catch the raider from behind.\nWrist hold: Wrist hold is also a defensive skill and\nused occasionally only when a situation presents\nitself. This hold is rarely used now a days.\n\nCc\n\n—\n\nd\n\n—\n\ne€\n\n—\n\nBlocking: It is a defensive skill used by covers\nand corners. Blocking is an act of creating a\nwall of obstruction in the path of the raider to\nprevent the movement. The aim of blocking is not\njust to obstruct the path, but also to catch\nthe raider.\n\nTactics\n\nTactics means exploiting a given situation to one’s advantage.\nThis is also done to create a situation to suit one’s purpose.\nThe raider may increase or decrease the tempo of the game\ndepending on the situation. In order to do this the player\nmay adopt a passive raid or an aggressive raid by creating a\nsituation for a struggle. Sometimes the raider may pass time\nin the last few minutes of the game, especially when the team\nis leading and the opponents are playing an aggressive game.\nKeeping in view the game situation, different tactics adopted\nby the raider.\n\nRetreat\n\nUnless the raider returns to home court safely after the raid,\nthe raid cannot be treated as successful. This is called a\nretreat. The raider has to pre-plan the path of retreat before\nstarting the raid. While retreating to home court, the raider\nshould keep the following points in view —\ne The raider does not give room for pursuit.\ne The raider regains their defensive position quickly\nbefore the opponent team’s raider begins the raid.\ne While returning to home court, the raider must pass\nonly through the midline.\n\nRaid\n\nRaid is the offence part of the game.

        "text": "Judo is a popular martial art, combative and\nOlympic sport. In the term judo, ‘ju’ means\n‘gentle’ and ‘do’ means ‘the way or path’.\nJudo was developed in Japan in the late 19th\ncentury by using the principles of balance and\nleverage adapted from jujutsu. Its most prominent\nfeature is its competitive element, where the\nobjective is to either throw or putdown one’s\nopponent to the ground, immobilise or otherwise\nsubdue one’s opponent with a grappling maneuver,\nor force an opponent to submit by joint locking or\nby executing a stranglehold or choke. Strikes and\nthrusts by hands and feet as well as self-defense\nare a part of judo. Many are trained in Judo either\nfor participation in competition or self-defense.\n\nFig. 7.5: Player playing Judo\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of judo starts with Japanese jujutsu. It was\ncreated by Professor Jigoro Kano and he believed that the\ntechniques could be practiced as a competitive sport if the\nmore dangerous techniques were omitted. By 1910 Judo was\na recognised sport that could be safely engaged in and in\n1911 it was adopted as a part of Japan’s educational system.\nIn the same year, the Kodokan Judo Instructors’ Training\nDepartment, Kodokan Black Belt Association and Japan\nAthletic Association were formed. World War II saw a different\ndevelopment of Judo. Instead of being used for sport, Judo was\nbeing taught as a combat skill. Those selected for commando\nand special services training often achieved a high standard\nof expertise. When Japan hosted the 1964 Olympics, Judo\nwas given its first opportunity as an event. Of the 16 medals\nawarded for Judo, Japan won three gold medals, and one\nsilver medal. Judo was no longer a Japanese sport but had\ndeveloped to become an international sport.\n\nThere have been two main developments in Judo over the\nyears. The first was the introduction of weight categories.\nEarlier everyone fought everyone else, with the result that,\nif two players were equally matched in skill, the bigger man\nusually won. Initially there were three categories, and later\nthis was made into five. Inclusion of the sport in the Olympic\nGames in 1964 helped to hasten this important reform.\nThere are different styles of Judo. With its inclusion in the\nOlympics, there has been a shift towards a contest style\npractice. In clubs where this style is taught, the practice\nbecomes largely a continuous contest. Other schools stress\non skills. They favour repetitive movements to make them\ninstinctive and the development of speed through practice\nwith little resistance.\n\nHEALTH AND PuysicAL Epucation - CLass X\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-7.indd 122 8/24/2020 11:41:04 AM\n",

There\nis one referee who walks around inside the contest area and\nconducts the match. There are two judges who sit diagonally\nacross the mat from one another, each in a corner. The two\njudges assist the referee and indicate when the contestant\ngoes outside of the contest area. The referee is in charge\nof awarding points and accessing penalties and uses hand\ngestures to signal his decision. However, if a judge disagrees\nwith a call, then the three officials take a vote and the decision\nis decided by a majority vote. In addition to the Judge and\nReferees there are also scorekeepers and timers. There is\nusually a scoreboard, which displays points and penalties\nand it can either be electronic or manual. Medical personnel\nare also on hand in the event of injury to a contestant.\n\nContestants\n\nThe two contestants, who are known as Judokas, compete for\n5 minutes for men and 4 minutes for women. One contestant\nwears white uniform and the other a blue uniform.\n\nUniforms\n\nThe judokas wear loose-fitting judo uniforms called judogi,\nconsisting of pants, a jacket and a belt. Judogi is made up\nof loose-fitting pants, a jacket and a belt that is tied around\nthe waist. The jacket and pants are made of cotton. They\nare either blue or white and they are made so a rival should\nbe able to get a grip on either one of them so as to be able\nto make a judo throw. One judoka will wear white the other\nblue. The belt is three meters long and it is wrapped around\nthe waist twice. The color of the belt signifies the rank the\ncombatant has reached.\n\nCompetition area\n\nThe entire competition area in judo is 46 to 53 feet square\n(14 to 16 meters). This area is made up of foam mats\ncommonly referred to as tatami mats and the individual\nmats are 6.5 feet by 3.281 feet wide (2 meters long, a 1-meter\nwide). Inside the competition area is a contest area, which\nis 8-10 meters square. This contest area (shiaijo) is green in\ncolor, that would be 29.5 feet square (9-meters) and it will\nhave a 3.281 foot (1-meter) red boundary around it. This is\nthe danger zone and it alerts the competitor(s) (judoka) that\nthey are about to go out of bounds. The area outside the\ndanger zone is the safety zone. This zone is three meters wide\nand it is the out-of-bounds area.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\ng\ns\ng\ns\nisl\nwo\n2\n0\nD\nuv\nie}\nfe\n7)\n\n8/24/2020 11:41:04 AM\n",

In India also it received regular patronage from the\nEmperors and Kings. Wrestling in India then was popularly\nknown as Malla Yuddha. In famous Indian epic, Mahabharata,\nBhima was considered to be a great wrestler of that time\nand some of the other great wrestlers included Jarasandha,\nDuryodhana, and Karna. Another Indian epic, Ramayana\nalso mentions about wrestling and Hanuman is described\nas one of the great wrestlers of that time. Wrestling in India\ncontinued to increase its popularity during modern days. Even\nduring the British rule, wrestling in India got encouraging\nsupport, as the British rulers included the game into the\nmilitary practice. In fact, India was considered among the\ntop 10 countries in wrestling till the 1960s. India also hosted\nthe World Wrestling Championship at New Delhi in 1967.\nThe term Kushti, which means wrestling, denotes both a\nlocal form of the art as well as a more global combat. Kushti\nis composed of three primary dimensions: dao, pench, and\npaintra (moves, counter-moves, and stance). There may\nbe similarities between the daos known as multani, dhobi\npat, and kalajangh and the corresponding freestyle moves\nknown as arm drag, front hip throw, and fireman carry. But\nwhat is significantly different about wrestling in India is\nthat wrestlers mostly wrestle in mud pits, engage in bouts\nthat last for half an hour or more. At other times and under\nother circumstances Indian wrestlers follow clearly defined\ninternational guidelines, rules, and regulations.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nII SINOdS GNV SAWVD WAL\n\n8/24/2020 11:41:05 AM\n",

    "full_text": "LIVING\n\nAdolescents in different situations experience a wide range\nof emotions that could vary from positive to negative, such\nas, happiness, satisfaction, sadness, anger, frustration, etc.\nThey have high expectations from themselves that may be\nfurther reinforced by people and environment around them.\nThis may cause stress in them. There are many occasions\nwhen they may get stressed or feel angry or frustrated.\nIt is natural for adolescents to experience both positive\nand negative emotions. It is also necessary to express their\nfeelings and emotions. There are positive and negative ways\nof expressing the emotions. It is pointed out that negative\nemotions and their expression in negative ways may be\ncaused by certain stresses experienced by the adolescents.\n\nIn today’s life, stress is becoming a major cause of many\nhealth-related problems. It is a known fact that chronic stress\nnegatively affects health. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus,\ncardiac problems, depression, anxiety attacks, road-rage,\netc., have become common now-a-days. The most common\nemotion faced by all of us during this COVID-19 pandemic\nis fear. It has also made us panicky and anxious to deal with\nsuch issues. Yoga can help us in dealing with stress and\nmental health issue during this time. In the management of\nstress, lifestyle plays an important role. A healthy lifestyle\nreduces stress and promotes one’s health.\n\nHere, it is important to recognise that stress can be\ntackled and definitely decreased. Many times, we may not\nnecessarily be in control of the situations but we can control\nour over-all response to such situations.\n\nWuat 1s STRESS?\n\nStress can be understood as a state of physiological and\npsychological imbalance resulting from demanding or\ndifficult situations which the person is not able to cope with.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-8_New.indd 133\n\nYOGA FOR HEALTHY\n\n1077CHO8\n\n8/24/2020 11:42:31 AM\n\n\nHEALTH AND PuysicaL EDUCATION - CLass X\n\n| Chap-8_New.indd 134\n\nThink and discuss the\nfollowing with your\nfriends:\nQuestions\nHave you ever\nexperienced stress?\nWhat was the cause\nof it?\nHow did you manage\nit?\nCan you think any\nother way by which\nyou could have better\nmanaged it?\n\nIn day-to-day life, a person faces many situations.\nSome situations are easy to handle; while some are difficult.\nAs a result, the body starts responding at physiological and\npsychological levels. At the physiological level, there may be\nchanges in heart rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, secretions\nof hormones, etc. At the psychological level, there may be\nchanges in attention, concentration, memory and alertness\nand also in the emotional state (like anger, fear, hate,\nsadness, etc.).\n\nStress generally occurs as a result of major events in\nlife, such as, tough competitions, getting low scores in an\nexamination, recent break-up in friendship, not getting a good\njob, a fight with others, and so on. There are several other\nfactors which may cause stress in a person, like, diseases,\npoor living conditions, poverty, problems in relationship,\nchallenges of adolescence, wrong habits, high aspirations,\nunrealistic goals, death of a close relative, discrimination,\nfast changing life and many others. However, sometimes it\nmay also occur due to minor issues, such as, not getting up\nearly, not getting ready on time, reaching school late, not\ngetting the desired food, arguments with a friend, not getting\npermission from parents for attending a late night party, and\nso on.\n\nIntensity of stress varies from person to person and\ngenerally depends on perception of a particular situation by\nthat person. A situation may be easy to handle for one person,\nwhile it may pose a big challenge to another. For example,\nexamination may cause stress in one student, while it may\nnot affect another student.\n\nStress which motivates us to perform better and learn new\nskills is beneficial. For example, getting admission in a new\ncourse, preparing for an examination or getting promotion\nmay cause stress but this stress is beneficial as it finally\ncontributes towards growth and development. Stress may be\nharmful also. When stress is severe and chronic it reduces\nefficiency of a person. This kind of stress may adversely affect\nour ability to feel, think and act.\n\nDuring severe stress, people may become restless and\nworried. They may not remember the things properly. Even\nsmall things may make them angry. You also might have\nobserved that when you are in tension you become restless.\nYou may not be able to focus on your studies and small\nthings may cause irritation.\n\nChronic and severe stress reduces our body’s ability\nto fight diseases. It can lead to various psychosomatic\ndiseases, such as, peptic ulcer, migraine, diabetes\nmellitus, high blood pressure, etc. It could even result in\nheart attack, brain stroke and death. Several psychological\ndisorders, such as, anxiety attacks and depression may\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n8/24/2020 11:42:31 AM\n\n\nalso result from chronic and severe stress. However, the\nfact is — we cannot avoid stress. Therefore, management\nof stress is necessary\n\nYoaa As A Way oF LIFE FOR STRESS\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nYoga has been considered a panacea for managing the stress.\nIn this context, we will discuss the role of yoga in developing\na healthy lifestyle by which stress can be managed. Yoga\npractices when become a way of life, play an important role\nin stress management.\n\nYou have learnt about asana, pranayama, kriya, mudra,\nbandha and meditation in Class IX. However, yoga is not\nlimited to the physical postures, breathing techniques or\nmeditation for a few minutes only. Rather yoga is a way of\nlife also. It propounds several principles and practices, such\nas, asana, pranayama, kriya, mudra, bandha and meditation 135\nwhich are relevant to healthy living. Yogic principles and\npractices of healthy living can be adopted by all, irrespective\nof age, gender, profession or place. As a way of life, yoga gives\ndirection about food, eating habits, thinking, recreational\nmeans and conduct. Yogic way of life, if adopted in true\nsense, empowers us to deal with stress and promote physical\nand mental health.\n\nThe components of yogic way of life are —\n\ne Ahara (Food)\n\ne Vihara (Relaxation)\n\ne Achara (Conduct)\n\ne Vichara (Thinking)\n\n¢ Vyavahara (Behaviour or actions)\n\nONIAY] AHLIVAL] MOA VOOK\n\nAhara\n\nThe principles of ahara are related to food consumption.\nYoga emphasises on mitahara, which is related to quality\nand quantity of food and also the state of mind during the\nintake of food.\n\nAs for the quality, the concept of mitahara implies that\nfood should be freshly cooked, nutritious, nourishing and\nin the natural form. Regarding quantity of food, mitahara\nmentions that two quarters of the stomach should be\nfilled with food, one quarter with liquid and the remaining\nquarter (one-fourth) should be left empty for free flow of air.\nThis implies that quantity of food may vary from person to\nperson depending upon the individual requirements. It is\nvery natural that a sportsperson will require more food as\ncompared to a person who is doing desk job. Mitahara also\nadvocates that the food should be eaten with positive state of\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-8_New.indd 135 8/24/2020 11:42:31 AM\n\n\nmind with utmost concentration. You might have observed\nif someone eats while watching the television or in an angry\nmood or when the person’s attention is somewhere else, then\nthey tend to just gulp down the food without enjoying it. So,\nthe state of mind is also very important while eating. Thus,\nmitahara emphasises that right quality and quantity of food\nshould be eaten in a positive state of mind.\n\nIn Column I, put a list of food items that you like eating and in Column II put the food items\nthat you consider good for your health.\n\nColumn I Column II\nFood items that you like eating Food items that you consider good for health\n\nQuestions\ne Compare the items of both the columns. Do the items in Column I tally with those in\nColumn II?\n\ne Do you think that you need to change your food habits? Make a separate list indicating\nwhich food items from the list (Column I) you want to change.\n\nVihara\n\nVihara means relaxation, which can be brought about\nby activities, such as, exercise, recreational and creative\nactivities like drawing, painting, singing, etc. These activities\nhelp to regulate and channelise our emotions and bring us\njoy and happiness. Yogic practices of asana, pranayama and\nmeditation relax body and mind. In addition to this, relaxation\ncan be attained in good company also. Sound sleep is also\nimportant for relaxation. It is, therefore, important that we\nshould regularly follow a timetable that provides adequate\n136 time for yogic and creative activities which are relaxing.\n\nHEALTH AND PuysicaAL Epucation - CLass X\n\nPrepare a timetable that allots some leisure time to pursue your hobbies and\ncreative activities, exercise and sufficient time for sleep.\n\nTime allocated Activities\n* 5,30 to 6.30 pm e Yogasana\ne e\ne e\nBe: ell\nLoar NW ar Vy \\\\\n\n— ~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-8_New.indd 136 8/24/2020 11:42:31 AM\n\n\nAchara\n\nAchara means conduct that includes emotions, attitudes,\ndesires, instincts and habits. Right conduct is essential for\na stress-free life. Positive emotions and positive attitudes,\ngood habits and control on desires help in making us strong,\nboth, individually and socially. The right conduct protects us\nfrom unnecessary stress caused by negative emotions and\nattitudes like hate, jealousy, fear, etc.\n\nTherefore, we should have control on our desires, instincts,\nemotions, habits and attitudes. Here, yoga is important as\nit encourages good conduct in our personal and social life.\nYoga advocates for positive emotions and positive attitude\ntowards self and other persons.\n\nIn this context yogic principles of Yama (restraint) and\nNiyama (observance) help to develop control on our desires\nand emotions and bring about peace and harmony.\n\nVichara\n\nWe know that thoughts are very important as our behaviour\nis guided by the kind of thoughts we have. Our thinking\nshould be positive.\n\nPositive thoughts bring pleasure to our life; while negative\nthoughts can make us unhappy. Right thinking guides us\ntowards appropriate behaviour. It helps in prevention and\nmanagement of stress-related health problems.\n\nYoga prescribes that one should have positive thoughts.\nPositive thoughts give us strength to bear the sorrows of\nlife. Yogic practices like yama, niyama, pratyahara, dhyana\n(meditation), study of good literature, etc., help us in\ncontrolling our thoughts and thereby promoting optimism\nin life.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-8_New.indd 137\n\nRamesh and his friends\nare planning to _ skip\ntheir classes and go for a\nmovie instead. Ramesh is\nworried as he feels that\nit is not right to skip the\nclass without informing\nhis parents.

At this,\nShreya lost her temper\nand started shouting at\nher parents.\nQuestions\ne Was Shreya’s behaviour\ntowards her parents\nappropriate?\ne Were her attitude and\nthinking responsible for\nthis kind of behaviour?\n\ne Suggest how she\nshould have behaved.\n\nVyavahara\n\nVyavahara (behaviour) means actions. Vyavahara is the\nresult of ahara, vihara, achara and vichara. Yogic philosophy\npropounds that our actions should be right. We should not\nindulge in wrong activities. Our behaviour towards others\nshould be appropriate. Karma- yoga proposes that we should\nperform right and act with full dedication and to our utmost\ncapacity without worrying about the results. We can remain\nstress-free and be happy if we follow this philosophy and act\naccordingly.\n\nYoaic PRACTICES\n\nThe practices which can strengthen the autonomic nervous\nsystem with the dominance of para-sympathetic system\nof body are beneficial for managing stress. Here are some\nasanas, pranayamas, kriya and relaxing practices which are\nhelpful in stress management.\n\nASANA\n\nHastottanasana\nHastottanasana comprises of three words— hasta, uttana\nand asana.

There are many occasions\nwhen they may get stressed or feel angry or frustrated.\nIt is natural for adolescents to experience both positive\nand negative emotions. It is also necessary to express their\nfeelings and emotions. There are positive and negative ways\nof expressing the emotions. It is pointed out that negative\nemotions and their expression in negative ways may be\ncaused by certain stresses experienced by the adolescents.\n\nIn today’s life, stress is becoming a major cause of many\nhealth-related problems. It is a known fact that chronic stress\nnegatively affects health. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus,\ncardiac problems, depression, anxiety attacks, road-rage,\netc., have become common now-a-days. The most common\nemotion faced by all of us during this COVID-19 pandemic\nis fear. It has also made us panicky and anxious to deal with\nsuch issues. Yoga can help us in dealing with stress and\nmental health issue during this time. In the management of\nstress, lifestyle plays an important role. A healthy lifestyle\nreduces stress and promotes one’s health.\n\nHere, it is important to recognise that stress can be\ntackled and definitely decreased.

At the physiological level, there may be\nchanges in heart rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, secretions\nof hormones, etc. At the psychological level, there may be\nchanges in attention, concentration, memory and alertness\nand also in the emotional state (like anger, fear, hate,\nsadness, etc.).\n\nStress generally occurs as a result of major events in\nlife, such as, tough competitions, getting low scores in an\nexamination, recent break-up in friendship, not getting a good\njob, a fight with others, and so on. There are several other\nfactors which may cause stress in a person, like, diseases,\npoor living conditions, poverty, problems in relationship,\nchallenges of adolescence, wrong habits, high aspirations,\nunrealistic goals, death of a close relative, discrimination,\nfast changing life and many others. However, sometimes it\nmay also occur due to minor issues, such as, not getting up\nearly, not getting ready on time, reaching school late, not\ngetting the desired food, arguments with a friend, not getting\npermission from parents for attending a late night party, and\nso on.\n\nIntensity of stress varies from person to person and\ngenerally depends on perception of a particular situation by\nthat person. A situation may be easy to handle for one person,\nwhile it may pose a big challenge to another. For example,\nexamination may cause stress in one student, while it may\nnot affect another student.\n\nStress which motivates us to perform better and learn new\nskills is beneficial. For example, getting admission in a new\ncourse, preparing for an examination or getting promotion\nmay cause stress but this stress is beneficial as it finally\ncontributes towards growth and development. Stress may be\nharmful also. When stress is severe and chronic it reduces\nefficiency of a person. This kind of stress may adversely affect\nour ability to feel, think and act.\n\nDuring severe stress, people may become restless and\nworried. They may not remember the things properly. Even\nsmall things may make them angry. You also might have\nobserved that when you are in tension you become restless.\nYou may not be able to focus on your studies and small\nthings may cause irritation.\n\nChronic and severe stress reduces our body’s ability\nto fight diseases. It can lead to various psychosomatic\ndiseases, such as, peptic ulcer, migraine, diabetes\nmellitus, high blood pressure, etc. It could even result in\nheart attack, brain stroke and death.

Regarding quantity of food, mitahara\nmentions that two quarters of the stomach should be\nfilled with food, one quarter with liquid and the remaining\nquarter (one-fourth) should be left empty for free flow of air.\nThis implies that quantity of food may vary from person to\nperson depending upon the individual requirements.

Yogic practices of asana, pranayama and\nmeditation relax body and mind. In addition to this, relaxation\ncan be attained in good company also. Sound sleep is also\nimportant for relaxation.

    "full_text": "Chap-9.indd 165\n\nFood is a basic human need. It is consumed to provide\nnourishment to the body. To achieve optimal level of fitness\ncertain dietary considerations are required. Mostly food is\nconsumed for its taste or appearance; however, both nutritive\nvalue and quality of food need attention. Food quality, food\nadulteration, food spoilage and impact of indiscriminate\nuse of pesticide and radiation on human health have been\ndiscussed in this lesson.\n\nDIETARY PLANNING\n\nDietary planning is an important step in proper food\nselection and preparation of meal to stay healthy and fit.\nDietary planning is a process of developing meal plans\nfor adequate nutrition within the available resources.\nNutritional requirement and food choices vary with regard to\ntheir age, sex, activity level and physiological condition. Food\nis planned accordingly to make it enjoyable, satisfying and\nhealthy. Planning is a scientific method of saving energy, time\nand money. It makes the tasks of procuring raw material,\npreparing meals and ensuring food quality simpler. It adds\nvariety the meals and reduces wastage.\n\nYou have studied the five food groups in Class IX. Revise\nthese and for reference keep these handy.\n\nFactors AFFECTING THE PLANNING\n\nEverybody needs a balanced diet irrespective of age but certain\nfactors influence the food choices. Consider the following\nfactors while planning meal for good health and fitness.\n\nAge\nBody’s need for food and nutrients varies greatly with age.\nAn infant needs only mother’s milk initially but needs extra\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n1077CHOS\n\ne Plan a meal (lunch or\ndinner) including some\nfood from each food\ngroup.\n\ne Record your one day\ndiet. Analyse each food\npreparation according\nto the food group. How\ncould you improve your\ndiet for the missing\nnutrients?\n\n8/24/2020 11:43:36 AM\n\n\nfood and nutrients with growing age. Adolescents grow at a\nfast pace and are active, so they need extra nourishment.\nBut their food preferences are often influenced by friends\nand media rather than nutritional requirement. They need\nguidance in this regard. Nutritious food preparations can\nbe planned in the form they enjoy, like spinach paratha or\nspinach, carrot and potato soup instead of spinach vegetable.\nElders often have difficulty in chewing, swallowing and\ndigestion; they need soft and easily digestible foods, such as,\nwell cooked vegetables, idli etc.\n\nGender\n\nNutritional requirements vary with gender. Till the age of 10\nyears nutritional requirements are same, thereafter both grow\nat different pace and their body composition is also different.\nMostly men are taller and heavier than women. They are more\nmuscular while women have more fat cells. Thus, their body\ntypes are different leading to different nutrient requirements.\nFemales need more iron (hemoglobin) due to blood loss during\nmenstruation. Lack of iron often puts them at high risk of\niron deficiency or anemia. Whole grains, seasonal fruits,\ngreen leafy vegetables and dairy products are healthy for both\ngenders. Food preferences may also vary with gender.\n\nPhysical activity\n\nEnergy and nutrient requirements vary with physical\nactivity. Sitting jobs like reading, computer work, etc., need\nless energy and heavy duty tasks like cycling, carrying heavy\nload, sports, etc., need more energy. Intensity and duration\nof activity also affect the requirements, e.g., a person cycling\nnormally needs lesser energy than a person participating in\na race, need nutrients, like vitamin B, in accordance with\nenergy requirement. In general energy from fried foods, extra\nbutter or ghee needs to be avoided. Food preparations from\nwhole foods, nuts, oilseeds, dairy foods, egg, and fish can\nfulfill the requirement for energy and other nutrients.\n\n~\naH\niS\noO\nzZ\niS)\n5\n5\nfa\nca\n5\nD\n2\nOu\na\nZ\nbr\n=\n‘\n\nPhysiological state\n\nPhysiological conditions like infancy, childhood, adolescence,\npregnancy, lactation impose high demands of food and\nnutrients due to higher rate of growth and development.\nFor example, a healthy sedentary woman needs\n1900 kcal/day while the same woman, if pregnant, will need\n2200 kcal. Similarly an adult man needs 0.8 g protein/Kg\nbody weight/day. The same person if an athlete requires\n2.0g protein/Kg body weight/day. Foods like laddoo (rich\nin calories) are quite suitable for highly active and growing\npersons while those with sedentary life style should avoid\nthem to prevent becoming overweight. Careful selection is\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-9.indd 166 8/24/2020 11:43:37 AM\n\n\nChap-9.indd 167\n\nhelpful to prevent malnutrition and illnesses. Physiological\nstate also affects the food preferences.\n\nEconomic considerations\n\nSome foods are expensive while others are cheap but both\nmay provide similar nutritional benefits, e.g., cashew nuts are\nexpensive, groundnuts are cheap and both are good sources\nof fat, protein, vitamins and minerals. Seasonal, local, fresh\nfoods are cheaper and more nutritious. The cost of a food\nitem also varies from one place to another. Purchasing from\nwhole sale markets, haats, etc., is economical. Homemade\nfood is cheaper.\n\nTime and skill\n\nThe number and types of dishes served in a meal depend\non the availability of time, ingredients, equipment and skills\nof the person who cooks. Lack of these may influence the\nquality of the meal. Hence, it is necessary to plan in such a\nway that nutritional quality is maintained. Preplanning and\ntime management skills are useful in preparing nutritious\nmeal in lesser time. All members of the family, including\nchildren, need to be engaged in food preparation activities in\nan appropriate manner.\n\nRegion, religion and culture\n\nEating habits are often linked with the foods produced in\nthe localily, e.g., people living in coastal areas eat more fish\nor coconut is popular in Kerala. When the same food is\nconsumed over a period of time it becomes cultural practice.\nReligion also influences the food habits e.g., the Jain\ncommunity does not eat onion, garlic, eggs, fish, meat, etc.,\nHowever, mobility, technology and various modern factors\nare lessening such impacts. Certain foods are associated\nwith festivals like, gujia in Holi.\n\nFood preferences of individuals\n\nFood preferences vary from person to person and strongly\naffect planning of meals, e.g., a vegetarian cannot eat meat and\na non-vegetarian will not get satisfaction with only vegetarian\ndishes. People from south India will get satisfaction with idli\nsambhar instead of dal roti. Occasional change is accepted\nbut dissatisfaction resulted from less preferred food over a\nlong period of time may lead to under-eating, malnutrition\nand health problems.\n\nSensory appeal\n\nHow food satisfies the sensory organs, e.g., tongue, nose,\neyes, ear, constitute sensory appeal.

For example, papad has to be crisp and\nbread soft; ice cream chilled and soup hot. This has to be\ngiven due consideration.\n\nSatiety value\n\nSatiety value implies a sense of pleasure and satisfaction that\na person gets from eating food. While planning meals, it is\nimportant to take care that it keeps one satisfied for sufficient\ntime and does not lead to hunger pangs soon. This in turn will\naffect the working capacity, efficiency and health of a person.\n\nMedia and advertisement\n\nMany persons, particularly children, choose food tempted by\nadvertisements. Further they choose a certain food because\nit is available on discount or as a free gift. Such practice is\ncommon with some processed, packaged and ready to eat\nfoods. These items may initially attract, appear cheap but on\nregular use they may turn out to be costly, less nutritious\nand unhealthy. Hence it is necessary to see nutrition facts\non the label of the packing to make healthy food choices.\nUsing the same concept to advertise nutritious foods will\nencourage people to choose and consume healthy diets.\n\nAccessibility and transport\n\nFoods available nearby are usually selected. It commonly\nhappens with people living in remote areas, elders, handicaps\nand persons not having requisite transport facilities. Famines,\ndroughts, heavy rainfall, cyclones and road blockages further\nlimit the food supply. Big bazaars, home delivery system and\nonline purchase have improved the access to food. Local\nhaats are organised which are also good sources of cheap\nand fresh food items.\n\nDIETARY CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPORTSPERSONS\n\nIn Class IX you have studied the dietary considerations for\ndifferent life stages of humans for their health and wellbeing.\nThe diets of sportpersons should be managed to help them\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n8/24/2020 11:43:37 AM\n\n\nChap-9.indd 169\n\nexhibit their best performance and maintain endurance.\nThey are constantly indulged in intense physical exercises,\ntraining, matches and competitions and other sports-related\nactivities. Hence their energy and nutritional requirements\nare also very high. Besides age, gender, body composition,\ntypes of sports, intensity and duration of the event, the\nenvironmental factors also greatly affect their nutritional\nrequirements. Adequate nutrition is of utmost importance for\ntheir health, physical fitness, endurance, peak performance\nand prevention of dehydration, injury and infection. The\nright kind of food given at the right time in right proportion\nis of paramount importance for sportpersons to prolong their\nsporting life.\n\nCarbohydrates\n\nCarbohydrates are major sources of energy for sportpersons.\nFor general fitness, 3-5 g carbohydrate per Kg body weight per\nday is sufficient. For intensive sport like football, gymnastic,\nweight lifting, 5-10 g carbohydrate per Kg body weight per\nday may be required. Body stores of carbohydrate (glycogen)\nmust be sufficient before and during exercise. Glycogen\nstores determine the stamina and performance. For one\nhour of exercise, no extra intake except water is needed.\nCarbohydrate requirement increases with increasing duration\nof workout. Timing of carbohydrates intake is vital. Intake\nof high carbohydrate, easily digestible food, 2-4 hours before\ntraining and event are advisable for quick energy release\nand replenishment in the body. Food preparations having\npotato (baked), bread, rice, semolina (suji), and banana\nalong with liquid food are suggested. Excessive consumption\nof carbohydrates may lead to weight gain, cause digestive\ndiscomfort, muscle stiffness, diarrhea, lethargy, etc., and\neventually hamper the performance.\n\nProtein\n\nDepending upon the intensity ofthe sport, protein requirement\ncan range from 1.2 -2.0g per kg body weight per day. Sufficient\nintake of carbohydrates ensures that protein is used for\nbuilding and repairing of muscles and tissues; for formation\nof hormones, enzymes, antibodies and neurotransmitters;\npreventing damage; and not for giving energy. For better\nutilisation of protein, consume carbohydrate and protein\nfood sources in appropriate proportion, preferably 3:1 or 4:1\nfor better performance in endurance events.\n\nFoods like egg, whey protein, soy and milk (casein),\nlow fat dairy products, grains, nuts, seeds and beans\nprovide good quality protein. Readymade protein powders\nshould be avoided or taken under expert supervision only.\nLow protein intake makes sportpersons susceptible to fatigue,\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\ne Make a diet plan\n\nfor your team\nparticipating in football\nin Meghalaya, giving\nsuitable justifications.\nYour physical\neducation teacher\nmust be planning\nevents for sports day.\nNote down the diets\n\nhe or she suggests to\nyou.

At the\nsame time high protein intake particularly from animal foods\nor protein powders or supplements may cause unnecessary\nweight gain, calcium excretion in urine and adverse effect\non bones, liver and kidney functions. Consumption of more\nprotein is advisable after the event, during rest period for\nrepair and recovery of the body.\n\nFat\n\nFat is not considered a good source of energy during exercise\nand competition. It is metabolised very slowly, thus, is\nbetter for slow and long duration events like marathon.\nFats like butter, cream, cow’s ghee or coconut oil are good\nfor synthesis of hormone necessary to maintain stamina in\nsport. Nuts, seeds, low fat dairy products are good choices\nas they also provide other nutrients and antioxidants. Foods\nrich in omega-3 fatty acids like flax seeds, fish oil, salmon,\nconsumed in the right amount, enhance strength and vigour\nin the body and accelerate performance. However, high intake\nof fat eventually leads to overweight, obesity and associated\nhealth problems which hamper performance significantly.\n\nVitamins and minerals\n\nVitamins and minerals are crucial in sport because energy\nutilisation in the body is largely associated with them,\nparticularly some group B vitamins and magnesium. Folate,\ncalcium, zinc, iron are other crucial micronutrients which\nget depleted faster during long exercises. Vitamin C plays\nan important role in collagen synthesis and absorption and\nutilisation of iron in the body. Vitamin B6 helps in protein\nutilisation.

It is a serious threat to food quality and can\nbe fatal. It is mainly caused by microorganisms, over activity\nof some enzymes and insects, pests and rodents. High\nmoisture content, temperature and nutrient composition of\nfood affects the growth of causative factors and accelerate\nfood spoilage. The knowledge of approximate shelf life of\ndifferent foods helps in reducing spoilage. The duration of\ntime during which the food item remains fit for consumption\nat room temperature is called shelf life which determines\nperishability. Thus, foods are —\n\n1. Perishable which remain fresh and edible for few\nhours to 1-2 days only, e.g., milk, meat, green leafy\nvegetables.\n\n2. Semi-perishable which remain fresh and edible for\nabout a week (5-7 days) e.g., some vegetables and\nfruits.\n\n3. Non-perishable which remain fresh and edible for\nmore than a month, e.g., grains, sugar, oil, pulses.\n\nFood is precious and is not available in unlimited quantity.\n\nSo food should not be wasted rather protected from spoilage.\n\nProper storage of food decreases food spoilage and various\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n8/24/2020 11:43:37 AM\n\n\ntreatments can also be given for this, food preservation is\none of them.\n\nFood preservation\n\nFood preservation is the process of treating and handling food\nto stop or slow down spoilage and extend shelf life of food.\nIt works on the principles of reducing the moisture content,\npreventing the growth of micro organisms causing spoilage\nand controlling enzymatic activity.

These will be needed\nin case of lodging a complaint to a company,\nmanufacturer, distributer, store-keeper or shop-\nkeeper or to consumer court under the Food Safety\nand Standards Act.\n\nEffects of pesticides on health\n\nPesticides are chemicals used in agriculture to protect crops\nin the fields, during storage and to control insects and pests\nin the surroundings, e.g., mosquitoes and cockroaches.\nThese can be chemical or biological in nature. Chemical\npesticides have played a significant role in increasing food\nproduction, but unnecessary and excessive use of these\nover a long period of time has adversely influenced various\nforms of life on earth, as well as, the quality of soil, water\nand environment. These have disrupted the natural balance\nof the ecosystem.\n\nPesticides often leave their residues in food which are\npassed on to the body. Those at higher risks are workers\nhandling or producing pesticides as pesticides are toxic in\nnature. The adverse effects of pesticide residues depend on\nthe type and amount of the pesticide and the route (ingestion\nor inhalation) and duration of exposure. If pesticide is used\nin accordance with good agricultural practice, the residual\nlevel would be low and consumption of such foods will not\nbe harmful. Symptoms of acute poisoning include vomiting,\ndiarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness and numbness. In severe\ncases, it may lead to difficulties in breathing, blurred vision\nand convulsion. Pesticides can cause damage to the brain\nand nervous system, liver, kidneys and are specially harmful\nto fetus. In India, FSSAI is responsible for setting maximum\nresidue limits (MRLs) for the pesticides.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\ne Search any two cases\nof food adulteration\n(personal experience,\nnews item, internet,\netc.), identify\nadulterant and its\neffect on health.\n\ne Whom can you\napproach when you\nsee fungus on bread;\nsuspect water in milk\nor find ice cream sold\nafter the expiry date?\n\ne Conduct a survey on\n10 persons to assess\ntheir actions on food\nsafety asking simple\n\nquestions like whether\n\nthey check sign of\nquality standard\n(FSSAI, Agmark\n\netc.), date of expiry,\ningredients, visual\ncondition of product,\npackage, etc., while\nbuying.

Seasonal, local, fresh\nfoods are cheaper and more nutritious. The cost of a food\nitem also varies from one place to another. Purchasing from\nwhole sale markets, haats, etc., is economical. Homemade\nfood is cheaper.\n\nTime and skill\n\nThe number and types of dishes served in a meal depend\non the availability of time, ingredients, equipment and skills\nof the person who cooks. Lack of these may influence the\nquality of the meal. Hence, it is necessary to plan in such a\nway that nutritional quality is maintained. Preplanning and\ntime management skills are useful in preparing nutritious\nmeal in lesser time. All members of the family, including\nchildren, need to be engaged in food preparation activities in\nan appropriate manner.\n\nRegion, religion and culture\n\nEating habits are often linked with the foods produced in\nthe localily, e.g., people living in coastal areas eat more fish\nor coconut is popular in Kerala. When the same food is\nconsumed over a period of time it becomes cultural practice.\nReligion also influences the food habits e.g., the Jain\ncommunity does not eat onion, garlic, eggs, fish, meat, etc.,\nHowever, mobility, technology and various modern factors\nare lessening such impacts. Certain foods are associated\nwith festivals like, gujia in Holi.\n\nFood preferences of individuals\n\nFood preferences vary from person to person and strongly\naffect planning of meals, e.g., a vegetarian cannot eat meat and\na non-vegetarian will not get satisfaction with only vegetarian\ndishes. People from south India will get satisfaction with idli\nsambhar instead of dal roti. Occasional change is accepted\nbut dissatisfaction resulted from less preferred food over a\nlong period of time may lead to under-eating, malnutrition\nand health problems.\n\nSensory appeal\n\nHow food satisfies the sensory organs, e.g., tongue, nose,\neyes, ear, constitute sensory appeal.

This in turn will\naffect the working capacity, efficiency and health of a person.\n\nMedia and advertisement\n\nMany persons, particularly children, choose food tempted by\nadvertisements. Further they choose a certain food because\nit is available on discount or as a free gift. Such practice is\ncommon with some processed, packaged and ready to eat\nfoods. These items may initially attract, appear cheap but on\nregular use they may turn out to be costly, less nutritious\nand unhealthy. Hence it is necessary to see nutrition facts\non the label of the packing to make healthy food choices.\nUsing the same concept to advertise nutritious foods will\nencourage people to choose and consume healthy diets.\n\nAccessibility and transport\n\nFoods available nearby are usually selected.

Chemical\npesticides have played a significant role in increasing food\nproduction, but unnecessary and excessive use of these\nover a long period of time has adversely influenced various\nforms of life on earth, as well as, the quality of soil, water\nand environment. These have disrupted the natural balance\nof the ecosystem.\n\nPesticides often leave their residues in food which are\npassed on to the body. Those at higher risks are workers\nhandling or producing pesticides as pesticides are toxic in\nnature. The adverse effects of pesticide residues depend on\nthe type and amount of the pesticide and the route (ingestion\nor inhalation) and duration of exposure. If pesticide is used\nin accordance with good agricultural practice, the residual\nlevel would be low and consumption of such foods will not\nbe harmful. Symptoms of acute poisoning include vomiting,\ndiarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness and numbness. In severe\ncases, it may lead to difficulties in breathing, blurred vision\nand convulsion. Pesticides can cause damage to the brain\nand nervous system, liver, kidneys and are specially harmful\nto fetus. In India, FSSAI is responsible for setting maximum\nresidue limits (MRLs) for the pesticides.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\ne Search any two cases\nof food adulteration\n(personal experience,\nnews item, internet,\netc.), identify\nadulterant and its\neffect on health.\n\ne Whom can you\napproach when you\nsee fungus on bread;\nsuspect water in milk\nor find ice cream sold\nafter the expiry date?\n\ne Conduct a survey on\n10 persons to assess\ntheir actions on food\nsafety asking simple\n\nquestions like whether\n\nthey check sign of\nquality standard\n(FSSAI, Agmark\n\netc.), date of expiry,\ningredients, visual\ncondition of product,\npackage, etc., while\nbuying.

Rigveda says, “Self preservation is the first law of nature.”\nThus, safety and security should be our primary concern.\nHowever, injuries and accidents cannot be predicted. These\nmay occur anywhere and anytime. If they are not managed\nproperly, they may have consequences like physical or\nmental disability. Therefore, they need to be prevented and\nmanaged properly. We try to minimise accidents with the\nhelp of safety measures. In this chapter we will be learning\nabout precautions to keep ourselves safe and secure. First\naid is essential before advanced medical care is available.\nDrug or substance abuse and its effects and prevention are\nalso discussed in this chapter.\n\nSAFETY AT THE WoRK PLACE\n\nMany injuries and accidents are reported at work place as\nwell as in playfield. Factors like congested space, faulty\nequipments, improper methodology and carelessness cause\nthese. For example, while working with chemicals in chemistry\nlaboratory, working with equipment in physics laboratory or\non playground, one needs to be careful. Every action (with or\nwithout equipment) govern with proper rules and methodology\nwhich are helpful to minimise chances of accidents.\n\nSafety while working with machines\nMachines, whether hand operated or automatic, make\nlife easy and comfortable. But they may be the cause of\nphysical injuries and accidents if not handled carefully.\nThere are certain dos and don’ts for safety while working on\nmachines —\ne Wash hands to remove oil and grease or use chalk\npowder for proper handling.\ne Avoid wearing loose clothes. They can get entangled\nwith machines.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-10.indd 181\n\nSAFETY MEASURES\n\n1077CHIO\n\n8/24/2020 11:45:08 AM\n\n\ne Concentrate on work and avoid talking.\n¢ Switch off electricity if the machine is not in use.\n\ne Keep extra or spare parts carefully in proper places so\nthat they do not fall on any one.\n\ne Avoid touching the moving parts of any machine.\nThis may tear-off the skin or cause burn due to heat.\n\ne Enlist and paste\npictures of the safety\nequipment’s or gadgets\nof any five sports of\nyour choice.\n\ne Name the tablets kept\nin grain containers to\ncontrol grain insect.\n\ne Enlist five household\ninsecticides.

It\nis a life saving measure used when the heart and breathing\nhas stopped.\n\nStarting CPR within three minutes of heart stoppage is\nvery important or else brain will be damaged.\n\nCardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR): Circulation is\nmaintained by chest compressions. Draw a line between the\ntwo nipples and keep the heel of the hand over the centre\nof this line. Place the other hand over it and give chest\ncompressions pressing down the breast bone 1.5 to 2 inches.\n\nFig. 10.1: Giving chest compressions\n\nThe ratio of chest compressions to breathing should be\n30:2 (i.e. 30 chest compressions and 2 artificial breaths per\nminute) as we have to provide a heart rate of approximately\n\n100 beats per minute.\n\nOpen the airway: The\nairway is cleared by finger\nsweep if required.

This makes them more vulnerable\nto substance misuse, especially when they do not have\ncorrect and scientific information. They also lack life skills\nto deal with the wide ranging negative outcomes of extreme\ndependency on a substance and thereby, getting addicted\nto it.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-10.indd 187 8/24/2020 11:45:11 AM\n\n\nWhat is substance abuse?\n\nAs you have learnt, drugs affect the body by changing\nthe mental and physical status of a person. Some other\nsubstances also work in the same way and are not necessarily\ndrugs. The non-medical use of a substance including drugs,\nthat changes an individual’s mental and physical status and\naffect the health adversely, is known as substance abuse.\n\nOnce a person starts using a substance, his mental state\nis altered and the person cannot get out of this habit. The\nextreme dependency on the substance compels them to\nincrease the intake every day. This is called addiction.\n\nSubstance misuse is widespread today including\nadolescents across the world. Socially acceptable drugs\nlike tobacco and alcohol abuse not only ruins the life of the\nindividual but can also influence them to associated with\ncrime and violence.\n\nCommonly abused substances\n\nThere are substances that can be abused for their mood-\naltering effects such as inhalants and solvents. On the other\nhand, there are drugs that can be abused that have no mood-\naltering or intoxication properties, such as, anabolic steroids.\nThey are abused by the adolescents and youth during body\nbuilding, to look more muscular.\n\nCommonly abused substances are tobacco, alcohol,\nmarijuana (ganja), opium, cannabis, solvents (petrol, glue,\ncorrection ink) and aerosols inhalants, cough syrup, caffeine,\ncocaine and ecstasy. There are other substances like gutka\nand paan (betel).\n\nThese substances can be ingested, inhaled, drunk,\nchewed or injected by a syringe in the blood. Some of these\nsubstances make one addicted, even if taken once.\n\nReasons for substance abuse in young people\n\nYoung people are more vulnerable to substance abuse due to\nthe following reasons —\n\n~\naH\niS\noO\nzZ\niS)\n5\n5\nfa\nca\n5\nD\n2\nOu\na\nZ\nbr\n=\n‘\n\ne During the process of growing up, poor self-esteem, low\nachievement at school, performance pressures, etc,.\nare some of the factors that promote substance abuse\nin adolescence. Resorting to substance use as a means\nof ‘growing up’ or fun also makes the adolescents more\nvulnerable to substance abuse.\n\ne Pressure from peers or friends to try an addictive\nsubstance, the urge to gain popularity among friends,\nand desire to experiment and curiosity to try out new\nthings also make young people particularly vulnerable\nto substance abuse.\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-10.indd 188 8/24/2020 11:45:11 AM\n\n\ne Previous experience of taking substance.\ne Family history of substance misuse.\ne Lack of support from family, friends and school.\n\ne Lack of knowledge about the effects and dangers of\nconsuming addictive substances.\n\n¢ Glamorising substance misuse by media misleads\nyoung people.\n\ne Easy availability of substances and drugs are the main\nreasons for substance misuse in young people.\n\n¢ Social approval of substance abuse like tobacco, paan,\nbeetel nut, gutka chewing or taking wine in parties\nencourages young people to initiate abuse of these\nsubstances.\n\nCASE 1\n\nSohan has performed well in Class IX annual exams. Now, he\nis worried whether he will be able to keep up his performance\nand score good grades in Class X. His parents always tell him\nhow they expect to see him at the top of his class. Afraid\nof disappointing them, Sohan does not share his concerns\nwith his parents. He feels that some of his friends may be\ngoing through the same phase and discusses his problem with\nthem. His friends suggest that smoking may reduce his stress\nand help him to relax. Sohan wants to feel better and decides\nto follow his friends’ advice. He starts smoking a cigarette or\ntwo everyday. Without realising, over a period of six months\nhe was smoking 6-10 cigarettes a day. Smoking has become a\nhabit with him, and in future, it was the cause of his ill health.\n\nPoints for Discussion\n\na) What do you think is responsible for Sohan’s habit of\nsmoking and why?\n\nA\n3\n5\n:\ncq\n;\n:\na\n2\nZ\n\nb) Do you think smoking helped reduce Sohan’s stress?\nWhy?\n\nc) What else could Sohan have done to reduce his stress\neffectively?\n\nd) What role could Sohan’s parents have played to prevent\nhim from smoking?\n\nConsequences of substance abuse\n\nSubstance misuse leads to a number of short-term and long-\nterm effects that are detrimental to health.\n\nShort-term effects: These are effects that appear only\na few minutes after the intake of substance. The user feels\na false sense of well-being and a pleasant drowsiness.\nSome of the short-term effects are distorted vision, hearing\nand coordination, impaired judgment, bad breath and\nhangovers.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-10.indd 189 8/24/2020 11:45:11 AM\n\n\nLong-term effects: Substances having a long-term\nimpact lead to serious damage due to constant and excessive\nuse. These effects show up over a course of time and are\nusually caused by progressive damage to different body\norgans. Some of the health consequences include irregular\neating habits, sleep disorders, poor hygiene resulting in\npoor health and low immunity. This predisposes substance\nabuser to diseases and infections.\n\nSubstance abuse in itself is not a cause of HIV/AIDS or\nSTDs but under the influence of drugs, people may engage\nin risk-behaviours that make them more susceptible to\nthese infections. Injectable drug users, however, are more\nprone to HIV in conditions where the users do not sterilise\nneedles and share needles to inject the drug.\n\nSubstance users may even die suddenly from a so-called\nDiscuss how a substance OVerdose, when one consumes more than what the body\nabuser’s life gets affected. Can tolerate. Death may also occur from long-term damage\n\nto the organs of the body.\n\nThese substances are especially harmful if consumed\nduring pregnancy. These substances reach the foetus\nthrough blood and harm it by crippling its growth and\ndevelopment or death.\n\nSubstance abuse influences not only the individual\nand family but also the community. The persons who get\naddicted often lose interest in other activities be it school,\njob or any other responsibility. They are not able to take\ncare of their responsibilities and may become a liability\nfor their families and finally the society. Furthermore, it is\nexpensive to buy substances or drugs on a regular basis.\nHence, in desperation, addicted individuals may be forced\nto engage in petty severe crimes.\n\nPrevention of drug abuse\n\nPaying attention to the following may prevent young people\nfrom misusing substances —\n\n~\naH\niS\noO\nzZ\niS)\nE\nS\n5\nfa\nca\n5\nD\n2\nOu\na\nZ\nbr\n=\n‘\n\ne Peer pressure can be managed by being aware of\nthe implications of substance abuse and developing\nlife skills. One can not only save oneself from\nadopting risky behaviours under peer pressure but\nalso persuade the peers not to engage in unhealthy\nbehaviours such as substance misuse. Advocacy\nwith the involvement of local community can be quite\nuseful.\n\ne The different ways of dealing with negative peer\npressure are saying ‘No’ assertively, making an\nexcuse, reversal of pressure, and giving reasons.\n\ne Young people should also be educated to recognise\nthat a friend is someone who cares, protects and looks\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-10.indd 190 8/24/2020 11:45:11 AM\n\n\nafter the welfare of their friends rather than force and\ninitiate into unhealthy habits.\n\n¢ Young people should be empowered with life skills to\nknow about their body and their life. They should be\ntaking well-informed and responsible decisions.\n\ne The family and society should provide the support\nsystem for young children in their ‘low’ times.\n\ne As the attitudes related to smoking, drinking and\nmisuse of other substances are formed during\npre-adolescence and early adolescence, this is an\nimportant age to invest in prevention efforts.

Rigveda says, “Self preservation is the first law of nature.”\nThus, safety and security should be our primary concern.\nHowever, injuries and accidents cannot be predicted. These\nmay occur anywhere and anytime. If they are not managed\nproperly, they may have consequences like physical or\nmental disability. Therefore, they need to be prevented and\nmanaged properly. We try to minimise accidents with the\nhelp of safety measures. In this chapter we will be learning\nabout precautions to keep ourselves safe and secure. First\naid is essential before advanced medical care is available.\nDrug or substance abuse and its effects and prevention are\nalso discussed in this chapter.\n\nSAFETY AT THE WoRK PLACE\n\nMany injuries and accidents are reported at work place as\nwell as in playfield. Factors like congested space, faulty\nequipments, improper methodology and carelessness cause\nthese. For example, while working with chemicals in chemistry\nlaboratory, working with equipment in physics laboratory or\non playground, one needs to be careful. Every action (with or\nwithout equipment) govern with proper rules and methodology\nwhich are helpful to minimise chances of accidents.\n\nSafety while working with machines\nMachines, whether hand operated or automatic, make\nlife easy and comfortable. But they may be the cause of\nphysical injuries and accidents if not handled carefully.\nThere are certain dos and don’ts for safety while working on\nmachines —\ne Wash hands to remove oil and grease or use chalk\npowder for proper handling.\ne Avoid wearing loose clothes. They can get entangled\nwith machines.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-10.indd 181\n\nSAFETY MEASURES\n\n1077CHIO\n\n8/24/2020 11:45:08 AM\n",

Some other\nsubstances also work in the same way and are not necessarily\ndrugs. The non-medical use of a substance including drugs,\nthat changes an individual’s mental and physical status and\naffect the health adversely, is known as substance abuse.\n\nOnce a person starts using a substance, his mental state\nis altered and the person cannot get out of this habit. The\nextreme dependency on the substance compels them to\nincrease the intake every day. This is called addiction.\n\nSubstance misuse is widespread today including\nadolescents across the world. Socially acceptable drugs\nlike tobacco and alcohol abuse not only ruins the life of the\nindividual but can also influence them to associated with\ncrime and violence.\n\nCommonly abused substances\n\nThere are substances that can be abused for their mood-\naltering effects such as inhalants and solvents. On the other\nhand, there are drugs that can be abused that have no mood-\naltering or intoxication properties, such as, anabolic steroids.\nThey are abused by the adolescents and youth during body\nbuilding, to look more muscular.\n\nCommonly abused substances are tobacco, alcohol,\nmarijuana (ganja), opium, cannabis, solvents (petrol, glue,\ncorrection ink) and aerosols inhalants, cough syrup, caffeine,\ncocaine and ecstasy. There are other substances like gutka\nand paan (betel).\n\nThese substances can be ingested, inhaled, drunk,\nchewed or injected by a syringe in the blood.

Through these activities, you may have\nobserved that in a community, a group of people live in a particular\nlocal area. Secondly, they share common facilities, which differ from\nplace to place. In some areas, people have access to facilities, such\nas, water supply, sanitation, garbage disposal facilities, health\ncare services, recreational facilities, community centre, schools,\ntransportation, etc., but in some places people do not have access to\neven the most basic amenities.\n\nA community is said to be healthy when its members\ncontinuously work together to maintain, improve and expand\nthe available natural resources and avoid their wastage.\nThe healthy community only be develped when its members\nrecognise their roles and responsibilities. They strive to\ninculcate values and attitudes of cooperation, mutual\nrespect, tolerance, kindness, etc. The role of Panchayati Raj,\ncivil societies and other government institutions is also very\nimportant to promote healthy living.\n\nImportant features of healthy community living\n\nMaintaining cleanliness of our home and surroundings is\nan essential feature of healthy community living. Healthy\ncommunity is one in which all residents have access to\nquality education, safe and healthy homes, adequate\nemployment, transportation, physical activity and\nnutrition. Living in overcrowded and unhygienic places\nwith excessive noise and pollution, may lead to various\nforms of illnesses, diseases and stress. For instance, lack\nof adequate space, poor ventilation in rooms and toxic\nfumes in the air, increase the risk of air borne diseases.\nAccess to basic amenities such as regular water supply,\nsafe drinking water and sanitation, is important for\nhealthy community living. In the previous classes (Classes\nVII to IX), it has been learnt that open and unattended\ngarbage dumps are a potential breeding place for flies,\ncockroaches, insects and so on. Stagnant water and open\ndrains breed mosquitoes, the carrier of diseases, such as,\nmalaria, dengue and chikungunya. Water borne diseases,\nsuch as, cholera, jaundice, diarrhea and gastroenteritis\nare also resulted due to water pollution.\n\nAccess to basic amenities also includes other provisions\nsuch as electricity, hospitals, dispensaries, housing facilities,\nroads and transportation, schools, colleges, employment,\nsecurity, recreational facilities and so on. Imagine a situation\nwhen a member in the family falls seriously ill and requires\nurgent treatment. What would happen to this person if there\nare no hospitals in the nearby city, or no transportation\nfacilities to reach there?\n\nHEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION - CLASS X\n\nAY\nLZ\nLTA “( De\nDi aN ma 110\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-11.indd 196 8/24/2020 11:46:07 AM\n\n\nTo ensure these basic amenities, the role of the local\ngovernment or panchayats is very important. They are required\nto ensure rules and regulations for safety measures, cleanliness,\nensure equal access of public amenities to all members,\npromote adoption of waste management practices, and help\necological restoration and conservation. However, we cannot\ndepend solely on the government to take the initiative. The\nquality of life in a community also depends on how the members\nof the community work to improve on available resources\nand ensure that the government provides for these facilities.\n\nIn order to work collectively, members of a community\nneed to develop values of co-operation, kindness, respect,\ngratitude, joy, peace and selflessness. These attributes are\nimportant in fostering the principles of collective work and\nin nurturing healthy social relationships. The example\nof Mawlynnong village shows that high income alone\nis not the only criterion for healthy living. Cooperative\naction, responsibility and positive values can also help in\nimproving the quality of life, and healthy living conditions\nfor one and all.\n\nONIAYT ALINONININOT) AHLIVALL\n\nPREVENTION OF CORONAVIRUS: SOCIAL\nDISTANCING AND DEALING WITH STIGMA\n\nPrevention through social distancing\n\nSocial Distancing: Deliberately increasing the physical space\nbetween people to avoid spreading illness and staying at\nleast one meter away from other person decreases chances\nof catching coronavirus (COVID-19).\n\nSocial distancing: Dos\n\n¢ Stay at home unless absolutely necessary.\n\n¢ Keep a distance of at least one meter between yourself\nand another person.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-11.indd 197 8/24/2020 11:46:08 AM\n\n\nSocial distancing: Don’ts\n\n¢ Do not hold events where people have to gather\n(even if it is a corner meeting with three or four friends,\nor an evening chat on the chaupal).\n\n¢ Do not go to crowded places like markets, shopping,\nmelas, parties.\n\n¢ Do not use public transport.\n\nCourtesy: https://www.mohfw.gov.in/\n\nFig. 11.4: Social distancing dos and don’ts\n\nDealing with the stigma\n\nWhatis stigma?\nIn any epidemic, it is common for individuals to feel stressed\nand worried because they fear —\n¢ falling ill and dying.\n¢ approaching health facilities due to fear of becoming\ninfected while in care.\n¢ losing livelihoods, not being able to work during\nisolation, and of being dismissed from work.\n¢ being socially excluded or placed in quarantine because\nof being associated with the disease.\n\nHEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION - CLASS X\n\n¢ feeling powerless in protecting loved ones and fear of\n198 losing loved ones because of the virus or being separated\nduring quarantine.\n¢ feelings of helplessness, boredom, loneliness and\ndepression due to being isolated and not working\ntowards caring for a dependent.\nStress is caused due to the above fears and being treated as\nan outcaste or blamed for spreading the disease.\n\nWhat is the reason behind the stigma?\n\nThe level of stigma associated with COVID-19 is based on\nthree main factors —\n\nyepeiri\\\\\\ee\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-11.indd 198 8/24/2020 11:46:08 AM\n\n\n¢ COVID-19 is a new disease about which many things\nare still being discovered.\n\ne When something is unknown people are worried which\nleads to fear.\n\n¢ Rumours or fake news give wrong information and\nspreads the fear.\n\nRecognising the stigma\n\nIt is very important to recognise stigma and handle it.

These values have to emanate from within\na person, but they can also be developed through various\nother ways. Camping can be seen as one of these ways which\nis extremely appropriate for students, particularly during the\nadolescent period.\n\nWhat is camping?\n\nYoungsters might\nhave already attended\na camp or may have\nheard about camping\nactivities from friends.\nCamping is an outdoor\nactivity, where familiar\nsurroundings are left to\nspend a night or several\nnights at an outdoor\nsite. The location of\nthese sites varies as\nper the objectives of the\ntrip, time of the year\nand budget available.\nCommon camping sites are: visits to villages or rural areas\nto understand their pattern of living; mountain areas,\nnational parks, lakes, beaches, forests, etc. One can also\nplan camping activities in a nearby place, such as, open\nfields, park, or even in an open space of the school premises.\nThe basic camping equipment include tents, cooking utensils\nor gadgets, sleeping bags, first aid kits, ropes, insect repellents,\n\nae\n4\noO\nzZ\ng\nE\nS\n5\na\nca\né\nw\nFe\nOu\nQ\n2\nbe\n=\n§\n-\n\n200\n\nFig. 11.6: Camping\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-11.indd 200 8/24/2020 11:46:09 AM\n\n\netc. These requirements will vary as per the location of the\ncamping site and objectives of the trip.

It gives an opportunity to\nlearn from nature in a joyful, exciting and adventurous\nmanner. Living in the natural environment with students\nfrom different areas, cultures, religions and backgrounds,\nhelp then to learn to work as a team in various activities.\nThese activities differ from adventurous and challenging\nones, to the most basic ones, such as, cooking, cleaning,\ncollecting water, etc. In this process, students learn the\nimportance of self-reliance, teamwork, co-existence,\nimportance of natural resources and organisational skills.\nCamping also offers great opportunities for empowerment\nof the girls.\n\na\n5\nrd\nQ\nie)\nZ\nZ\nGq\n4\nrd\ncM\ns\nZ\nQ\n\nFig. 11.7: Trekking Fig. 11.8: Mountaineering Fig. 11.9: Rock climbing\n\nWhile camping, one can engage in adventure sport,\nsuch as, trekking, river rafting, mountaineering, rock\nclimbing, repelling, paragliding, caving. Adventure sport\nhelp to develop courage, self-confidence, leadership\nqualities and enhance concentration powers. This is also\na great form of physical exercise.

Water borne diseases,\nsuch as, cholera, jaundice, diarrhea and gastroenteritis\nare also resulted due to water pollution.\n\nAccess to basic amenities also includes other provisions\nsuch as electricity, hospitals, dispensaries, housing facilities,\nroads and transportation, schools, colleges, employment,\nsecurity, recreational facilities and so on. Imagine a situation\nwhen a member in the family falls seriously ill and requires\nurgent treatment. What would happen to this person if there\nare no hospitals in the nearby city, or no transportation\nfacilities to reach there?\n\nHEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION - CLASS X\n\nAY\nLZ\nLTA “( De\nDi aN ma 110\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-11.indd 196 8/24/2020 11:46:07 AM\n",

Would you agree that the country’s\nconstitution provides for Justice, Liberty, Equality and\nFraternity which should be adopted in life for living happily\nand having consideration for all others in the group? Let us\nunderstand these four terms of our constitution which are\ndirectly related to “social health of a person or a country”,\nand then try to define social health. In other words, if one is\nsocially healthy, than will be able to develop interpersonal\nrelations, through maintaining equality, fraternity and\njustice.\n\nLet us now try and define social health.\n\nDEFINITION OF ‘SocIAL HEALTH’\n\nSocial health may be defined as the ability to form satisfying\ninterpersonal relationships with others. One who is able to\nmake positive relationships and acquires the ability to adapt\nin different social situations and act appropriately as per\nthe situation concerned, and can be called a socially healthy\nperson.\n\nNeed for developing social health\n\nPrimitive humans were hunter-gatherers, who lived in small\ngroups or clusters and spent their lives at individual levels.\nAround 10,000 years ago, they moved near rivers to grow\ntheir own food and began to live together. With the passage\nof time, they started to live in a society and developed a\nlanguage for interaction with each other. As ‘human society’\nprogressed, an individual became part of many social groups\nfor example a member ofa peer group, a family and kin, aclass\nin school, a native of a region and a citizen of one’s country.\nSocial changes occur from time to time and many societies\nlay down norms and values for group living. Urbanisation\nhas brought about many changes which are different from\ntraditional rural societies.\n\nSocial attributes, of people however, remain the same\nas they are based on interrelationship between members of\nany society and necessary for accomplishing tasks requiring\nteamwork. School is one of the platforms for learning social\nskills.\n\n*\nB\ns\n\\)\nZz\niS)\nE\nS\n5\na\nca\n<\ng\na\nFe\n4\na\n2\n:\na]\nan)\n\nROLE OF VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS\n\nPromotion of social health among children requires collective\nefforts and appropriate skills. All people in the field of\neducation have to think about this.\n\n~ Reprint 2025-26\n\n| Chap-12.indd 208 8/24/2020 11:46:39 AM\n\n\nRole of teacher training institutes and other\norganisations\n\nSchool teachers need a degree, diploma or certificates from a\nteacher training institute. There are a number of organisation\nconcerned with school education. The syllabus of teacher\ntraining courses should include the topics of important\nissues for children of which health should be one.\n\nOrganisations such as NCERT, SCERT, DIET should\nperiodically organise workshops, publish journals and\nprovide inservice training programmes on health issues\nincluding social health.\n\nRole of schools in promoting social health\n\nSchools have a very significant role to play in the promotion\nof health and safety of children. They spend a lot of time\nin school in early years. School environment forms ideal\nsetting for acquiring knowledge of healthy choices of food. It\nis in school that they participate in physical activity through\nsports, games, yoga, gymnastics, exercise and gain benefits\nof each. School helps children to learn social skills which\nassist in establishing lifelong healthy behavior. Children\nlearn team spirit and training in rules and regulations of\nsocial wellbeing just as in the defense services, which are\ninbuilt in training of defense service personnel, so they work\ntogether as a team to protect our nation.\n\nIn order to promote social health, the school should\nhave a positive environment where children mingle with\nteachers, peer group and non-teaching staff without fear and\napprehensions. Teacher have a significant role in this regard.\n\nD\n2)\nfe\n-\n3\nz\ni\n\nRole of teachers\n\nIt is well known that teachers are the mentors and therefore,\nthe teacher training institutes should make training in\nleadership and mentorship a part of teacher training. Also well\nknown saying that ‘example in better than precept’ Students\neasily learn to be socially healthy if the teacher herself or\nhimself sets an example rather than lecture on social health.\nA good teacher ensures that students grow up into physically,\nmentally and socially healthy individuals. In doing this the\nteacher has to make efforts to ensure that students —\n\n(i) eat a proper diet and perform regular exercise and\nphysical activity which are requirements of good\nphysical health.\n\n(ii) inculcate friendship between classmates, indulge\nin amicable behavior with others in school so that\nstudents develop a helpful nature. These are necessary\nfor mental and emotional health.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChap-12.indd 209 8/24/2020 11:46:40 AM\n\n\n3. Teachers should train students in learning life skills\n\nlike —\n\na) empathy and self awareness\n\nb) effective communication so that they develop\nhealthy Interpersonal relationships\n\nc) problem-solving and decision-making to learn to\nbe stress free\n\nd) creative and critical thinking\n\ne) coping with stress and emotion.\nThe above are absolutely essential for developing social\nskills in order to be socially healthy.\nSocial skills help a student to have a desirable self image\nand self esteem and also self confidence. This makes children\nacquire ability to live harmoniously in the society.\n\nRole of technology in building social health\n\nTechnology has made communication convenient through\nMobiles, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and E-mail\nmessages. Knowledge about different media can help to\ndevelop the skills to access the appropriate media for\naccurate information on a specific topic or issues. More\nso, because media brings awareness, and provides access\nto global knowledge and learning. But refrain from using\nmobiles and viewing the T.V. for long periods as that tends\nto be counter-productive and reduce interaction time with\nothers. This makes us socially withdrawn.

In other words, if one is\nsocially healthy, than will be able to develop interpersonal\nrelations, through maintaining equality, fraternity and\njustice.\n\nLet us now try and define social health.\n\nDEFINITION OF ‘SocIAL HEALTH’\n\nSocial health may be defined as the ability to form satisfying\ninterpersonal relationships with others. One who is able to\nmake positive relationships and acquires the ability to adapt\nin different social situations and act appropriately as per\nthe situation concerned, and can be called a socially healthy\nperson.\n\nNeed for developing social health\n\nPrimitive humans were hunter-gatherers, who lived in small\ngroups or clusters and spent their lives at individual levels.\nAround 10,000 years ago, they moved near rivers to grow\ntheir own food and began to live together. With the passage\nof time, they started to live in a society and developed a\nlanguage for interaction with each other. As ‘human society’\nprogressed, an individual became part of many social groups\nfor example a member ofa peer group, a family and kin, aclass\nin school, a native of a region and a citizen of one’s country.\nSocial changes occur from time to time and many societies\nlay down norms and values for group living. Urbanisation\nhas brought about many changes which are different from\ntraditional rural societies.\n\nSocial attributes, of people however, remain the same\nas they are based on interrelationship between members of\nany society and necessary for accomplishing tasks requiring\nteamwork. School is one of the platforms for learning social\nskills.\n\n*\nB\ns\n\\)\nZz\niS)\nE\nS\n5\na\nca\n<\ng\na\nFe\n4\na\n2\n:\na]\nan)\n\nROLE OF VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS\n\nPromotion of social health among children requires collective\nefforts and appropriate skills.

In doing this the\nteacher has to make efforts to ensure that students —\n\n(i) eat a proper diet and perform regular exercise and\nphysical activity which are requirements of good\nphysical health.\n\n(ii) inculcate friendship between classmates, indulge\nin amicable behavior with others in school so that\nstudents develop a helpful nature.

We continue our discussion on real numbers in this chapter. We\nbegin with very important properties of positive integers in Sections 1.2, namely the\nEuclid’s division algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\nEuclid’s division algorithm, as the name suggests, has to do with divisibility of\nintegers. Stated simply, it says any positive integer a can be divided by another positive\ninteger 5 in such a way that it leaves a remainder r that is smaller than b. Many of you\nprobably recognise this as the usual long division process. Although this result is quite\neasy to state and understand, it has many applications related to the divisibility properties\nof integers. We touch upon a few of them, and use it mainly to compute the HCF of\ntwo positive integers.\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, on the other hand, has to do something\nwith multiplication of positive integers. You already know that every composite number\ncan be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way—this important fact is the\nFundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Again, while it is a result that is easy to state and\nunderstand, it has some very deep and significant applications in the field of mathematics.\n\nWe use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for two main applications. First, we\nuse it to prove the irrationality of many of the numbers you studied in Class IX, such as\nV2, V3 and (5 . Second, we apply this theorem to explore when exactly the decimal\n\nexpansion of a rational number, say Lae # 0), is terminating and when it is non-\n\nterminating repeating. We do so by looking at the prime factorisation of the denominator\n\nq of P You will see that the prime factorisation of g will completely reveal the nature\nof the decimal expansion of P.\n\nq\nSo let us begin our exploration.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nZz MATHEMATICS\n\n1.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic\n\nIn your earlier classes, you have seen that any natural number can be written as a\nproduct of its prime factors. For instance, 2 = 2, 4= 2 x 2, 253 = 11 x 23, and so on.\nNow, let us try and look at natural numbers from the other direction. That is, can any\nnatural number be obtained by multiplying prime numbers? Let us see.\n\nTake any collection of prime numbers, say 2, 3, 7, 11 and 23. If we multiply\nsome or all of these numbers, allowing them to repeat as many times as we wish,\nwe can produce a large collection of positive integers (In fact, infinitely many).\nLet us list a few :\n\n7x 11x 23=1771 3x 7x 11 x 23=5313\n2x3x7%x 11x23 = 10626 23x 3x 7 = 8232\n2?x3x7x 11 «x 23=21252\n\nand so on.\n\nNow, let us suppose your collection of primes includes all the possible primes.\nWhat is your guess about the size of this collection? Does it contain only a finite\nnumber of integers, or infinitely many? Infact, there are infinitely many primes. So,\nif we combine all these primes in all possible ways, we will get an infinite\ncollection of numbers, all\nthe primes and all possible\nproducts of primes. The\nquestion is — can we\nproduce all the composite\nnumbers this way? What\ndo you think? Do you\nthink that there may be a\ncomposite number which\nis not the product of\npowers of primes?\nBefore we answer this,\nlet us factorise positive\nintegers, that is, do the\nopposite of what we have\ndone so far.\n\nWe are going to use\nthe factor tree with which\nyou are all familiar. Let us\ntake some large number,\nsay, 32760, and factorise\nit as shown.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nREAL NUMBERS 3\n\nSo we have factorised 32760 as 2 x 2x2*3x3x5x7~x 13 asa product of\nprimes, i.e., 32760 = 2? x 3? x 5 x 7 x 13 as a product of powers of primes. Let us try\nanother number, say, 123456789. This can be written as 3° x 3803 x 3607. Of course,\nyou have to check that 3803 and 3607 are primes! (Try it out for several other natural\nnumbers yourself.) This leads us to a conjecture that every composite number can be\nwritten as the product of powers of primes. In fact, this statement is true, and is called\nthe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic because of its basic crucial importance\nto the study of integers. Let us now formally state this theorem.\n\nTheorem 1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) : Every composite\nnumber can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation\nis unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur.\n\nAn equivalent version of Theorem 1.2 was probably\nfirst recorded as Proposition 14 of Book IX in Euclid’s\nElements, before it came to be known as the\nFundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. However, the\nfirst correct proof was given by Carl Friedrich Gauss\nin his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae.\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss is often referred to as the ‘Prince\n\nof Mathematicians’ and is considered one of the three\n\ngreatest mathematicians of all time, along with\n\nArchimedes and Newton. He has made fundamental Carl Friedrich Gauss\ncontributions to both mathematics and science. (1777 — 1855)\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that every composite number can\nbe factorised as a product of primes. Actually it says more. It says that given any\ncomposite number it can be factorised as a product of prime numbers in a ‘unique’\nway, except for the order in which the primes occur. That is, given any composite\nnumber there is one and only one way to write it as a product of primes, as long as we\nare not particular about the order in which the primes occur. So, for example, we\nregard 2 x 3 x 5 x 7as the same as 3 x 5 x 7 x 2, or any other possible order in which\nthese primes are written. This fact is also stated in the following form:\n\nThe prime factorisation of a natural number is unique, except for the order\nof its factors.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n4 MATHEMATICS\n\nIn general, given a composite number x, we factorise it as x = p,p, ... p,, where\nP\\> Py» Pp, are primes and written in ascending order, i.e., p, < p,\n<...<p,. Ifwe combine the same primes, we will get powers of primes. For example,\n\n32760 =2*x2x2x3x3x5x7x 13=2?x3?x5x7 x 13\n\nOnce we have decided that the order will be ascending, then the way the number\nis factorised, is unique.\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic has many applications, both within\nmathematics and in other fields. Let us look at some examples.\n\nExample 1 : Consider the numbers 4”, where 7 is a natural number. Check whether\nthere is any value of n for which 4” ends with the digit zero.\n\nSolution : Ifthe number 4\", for any 1, were to end with the digit zero, then it would be\ndivisible by 5. That is, the prime factorisation of 4” would contain the prime 5. This is\nnot possible because 4” = (2)?”; so the only prime in the factorisation of 4” is 2.

You even studied how to locate irrationals on the number\nline. However, we did not prove that they were irrationals. In this section, we will\nprove that 2, /3, J/5 and, in general, Jp is irrational, where p is a prime. One of\nthe theorems, we use in our proof, is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\n\nRecall, a number ‘s’ is called irrational if it cannot be written in the form Pp.\nwhere p and gq are integers and g # 0. Some examples of irrational numbers, with\nwhich you are already familiar, are :\n\n2, V3, Vis, x, -22, 0101011011110... ete.\n\nV3\n\nBefore we prove that ./2 is irrational, we need the following theorem, whose\nproof is based on the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\nTheorem 1.2 : Let p be a prime number. If p divides a’, then p divides a, where\na is a positive integer.\n*Proof : Let the prime factorisation of a be as follows :\n\na=pp,.--P,, where p,,p,, .. ., Pp, are primes, not necessarily distinct.\nTherefore, a° = (p,p,.--P,)(P,\\P, +--+ P,) = PiPS +» + Pe\nNow, we are given that p divides a’. Therefore, from the Fundamental Theorem of\nArithmetic, it follows that p is one of the prime factors of a*. However, using the\nuniqueness part of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, we realise that the only\nprime factors of a’ are p,, p,,...,p,. SO p is one of p,, P,, . . 5 P,»\n\nNow, since a = p, p,..-P,, p divides a.\nWe are now ready to give a proof that ./2 is irrational.\n\nThe proof is based on a technique called ‘proof by contradiction’. (This technique is\ndiscussed in some detail in Appendix 1).\n\nTheorem 1.3 : ,/2 is irrational.\nProof : Let us assume, to the contrary, that ./2 is rational.\n\n* Not from the examination point of view.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nREAL NUMBERS 7\n\nr\nSo, we can find integers r and s (# 0) such that ./2 = =F\n\nSuppose r and s have a common factor other than 1.

Therefore, 2 divides a’.\nNow, by Theorem 1.2, it follows that 2 divides a.\n\nSo, we can write a = 2c for some integer c.\n\nSubstituting for a, we get 2b° = 4c’, that is, b? = 2c’.\n\nThis means that 2 divides b’, and so 2 divides b (again using Theorem 1.2 with p = 2).\nTherefore, a and b have at least 2 as a common factor.\n\nBut this contradicts the fact that a and b have no common factors other than 1.\nThis contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that ,/2 is rational.\n\nSo, we conclude that ./2 is irrational.\n\nExample 5 : Prove that ./3 is irrational.\n\nSolution : Let us assume, to the contrary, that ‘/9 is rational.\n\na\n\nb\n\nSuppose a and b have a common factor other than 1, then we can divide by the\ncommon factor, and assume that a and b are coprime.\n\nSo, bV3 =@q:\n\nSquaring on both sides, and rearranging, we get 3b’ = a’.\n\nThat is, we can find integers a and b (#0) such that /3 =\n\nTherefore, a’ is divisible by 3, and by Theorem 1.2, it follows that a is also divisible\nby 3.\n\nSo, we can write a = 3c for some integer c.\nSubstituting for a, we get 3b’ = 9c’, that is, b? = 3c’.\n\nThis means that 5? is divisible by 3, and so 5 is also divisible by 3 (using Theorem 1.2\nwith p = 3).\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n8 MATHEMATICS\nTherefore, a and b have at least 3 as a common factor.\nBut this contradicts the fact that a and b are coprime.\n\nThis contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that ./3 is rational.\nSo, we conclude that ./3 is irrational.\n\nIn Class IX, we mentioned that :\n@ the sum or difference of a rational and an irrational number is irrational and\n\ne the product and quotient of a non-zero rational and irrational number is\nirrational.\n\nWe prove some particular cases here.\nExample 6 : Show that 5 — J3 is irrational.\nSolution : Let us assume, to the contrary, that 5 — 3 is rational.\nThat is, we can find coprime a and b (b #0) such that 5 — /3 = z\nTherefore, 5 — ; - 3.\n\nRearranging this equation, we get /3 =5 — wr Sa hl\nb b\n\nSince a and b are integers, we get 5 — © jis rational, and so 3 is rational.\nb\n\nBut this contradicts the fact that V3 is irrational.\nThis contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that 5 — V3 is\n\nrational.\n\nSo, we conclude that 5 — P is irrational.\n\nExample 7 : Show that 32 is irrational.\n\nSolution : Let us assume, to the contrary, that 3/2. is rational.\nThat is, we can find coprime a and b (b # 0) such that 3/2 = *\n#\n\n3b\n\na\nSince 3, a and b are integers, 3p is rational, and so ./2 is rational.\n\nRearranging, we get /2 =\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nREAL NUMBERS\n\nBut this contradicts the fact that ./2 is irrational.\n\nSo, we conclude that 3/2 is irrational.\n\nEXERCISE 1.2\n1.

We continue our discussion on real numbers in this chapter. We\nbegin with very important properties of positive integers in Sections 1.2, namely the\nEuclid’s division algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\nEuclid’s division algorithm, as the name suggests, has to do with divisibility of\nintegers. Stated simply, it says any positive integer a can be divided by another positive\ninteger 5 in such a way that it leaves a remainder r that is smaller than b. Many of you\nprobably recognise this as the usual long division process. Although this result is quite\neasy to state and understand, it has many applications related to the divisibility properties\nof integers. We touch upon a few of them, and use it mainly to compute the HCF of\ntwo positive integers.\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, on the other hand, has to do something\nwith multiplication of positive integers. You already know that every composite number\ncan be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way—this important fact is the\nFundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Again, while it is a result that is easy to state and\nunderstand, it has some very deep and significant applications in the field of mathematics.\n\nWe use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for two main applications. First, we\nuse it to prove the irrationality of many of the numbers you studied in Class IX, such as\nV2, V3 and (5 . Second, we apply this theorem to explore when exactly the decimal\n\nexpansion of a rational number, say Lae # 0), is terminating and when it is non-\n\nterminating repeating. We do so by looking at the prime factorisation of the denominator\n\nq of P You will see that the prime factorisation of g will completely reveal the nature\nof the decimal expansion of P.\n\nq\nSo let us begin our exploration.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

For instance, 2 = 2, 4= 2 x 2, 253 = 11 x 23, and so on.\nNow, let us try and look at natural numbers from the other direction. That is, can any\nnatural number be obtained by multiplying prime numbers? Let us see.\n\nTake any collection of prime numbers, say 2, 3, 7, 11 and 23. If we multiply\nsome or all of these numbers, allowing them to repeat as many times as we wish,\nwe can produce a large collection of positive integers (In fact, infinitely many).\nLet us list a few :\n\n7x 11x 23=1771 3x 7x 11 x 23=5313\n2x3x7%x 11x23 = 10626 23x 3x 7 = 8232\n2?x3x7x 11 «x 23=21252\n\nand so on.\n\nNow, let us suppose your collection of primes includes all the possible primes.\nWhat is your guess about the size of this collection? Does it contain only a finite\nnumber of integers, or infinitely many? Infact, there are infinitely many primes. So,\nif we combine all these primes in all possible ways, we will get an infinite\ncollection of numbers, all\nthe primes and all possible\nproducts of primes. The\nquestion is — can we\nproduce all the composite\nnumbers this way? What\ndo you think? Do you\nthink that there may be a\ncomposite number which\nis not the product of\npowers of primes?\nBefore we answer this,\nlet us factorise positive\nintegers, that is, do the\nopposite of what we have\ndone so far.\n\nWe are going to use\nthe factor tree with which\nyou are all familiar. Let us\ntake some large number,\nsay, 32760, and factorise\nit as shown.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

Let us try\nanother number, say, 123456789. This can be written as 3° x 3803 x 3607. Of course,\nyou have to check that 3803 and 3607 are primes! (Try it out for several other natural\nnumbers yourself.) This leads us to a conjecture that every composite number can be\nwritten as the product of powers of primes. In fact, this statement is true, and is called\nthe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic because of its basic crucial importance\nto the study of integers. Let us now formally state this theorem.\n\nTheorem 1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) : Every composite\nnumber can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation\nis unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur.\n\nAn equivalent version of Theorem 1.2 was probably\nfirst recorded as Proposition 14 of Book IX in Euclid’s\nElements, before it came to be known as the\nFundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. However, the\nfirst correct proof was given by Carl Friedrich Gauss\nin his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae.\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss is often referred to as the ‘Prince\n\nof Mathematicians’ and is considered one of the three\n\ngreatest mathematicians of all time, along with\n\nArchimedes and Newton. He has made fundamental Carl Friedrich Gauss\ncontributions to both mathematics and science. (1777 — 1855)\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that every composite number can\nbe factorised as a product of primes. Actually it says more. It says that given any\ncomposite number it can be factorised as a product of prime numbers in a ‘unique’\nway, except for the order in which the primes occur. That is, given any composite\nnumber there is one and only one way to write it as a product of primes, as long as we\nare not particular about the order in which the primes occur. So, for example, we\nregard 2 x 3 x 5 x 7as the same as 3 x 5 x 7 x 2, or any other possible order in which\nthese primes are written. This fact is also stated in the following form:\n\nThe prime factorisation of a natural number is unique, except for the order\nof its factors.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

For example,\n\n32760 =2*x2x2x3x3x5x7x 13=2?x3?x5x7 x 13\n\nOnce we have decided that the order will be ascending, then the way the number\nis factorised, is unique.\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic has many applications, both within\nmathematics and in other fields. Let us look at some examples.\n\nExample 1 : Consider the numbers 4”, where 7 is a natural number. Check whether\nthere is any value of n for which 4” ends with the digit zero.\n\nSolution : Ifthe number 4\", for any 1, were to end with the digit zero, then it would be\ndivisible by 5. That is, the prime factorisation of 4” would contain the prime 5. This is\nnot possible because 4” = (2)?”; so the only prime in the factorisation of 4” is 2.

Recall\nthat if p(x) is a polynomial in x, the highest power of x in p(x) is called the degree of\nthe polynomial p(x). For example, 4x + 2 is a polynomial in the variable x of\n\ndegree 1, 2y?— 3y + 4 is a polynomial in the variable y of degree 2, 5x? — 4x? + x— /2\n\n3\nis a polynomial in the variable x of degree 3 and 7u°— mul + 4u* +u—-8 isa polynomial\n\n1\n3 Vx +2, zn ete., are\n\nin the variable u of degree 6. Expressions like\nx-1 x +2x+3\n\nnot polynomials.\n\nA polynomial of degree | is called a linear polynomial. For example, 2x — 3,\n\nV3x + 5, yt V2 =< =, 3z+4, Su +1,etc., are all linear polynomials. Polynomials\n\nsuch as 2x + 5 —x?, x° + 1, etc., are not linear polynomials.\n\nA polynomial of degree 2 is called a quadratic polynomial. The name ‘quadratic’\n\nhas been derived from the word ‘quadrate’, which means ‘square’. 2x7 + 3x — =\n\ny? — 2, 2-x7+ 3x, 7 Qu? +5, J5v? -5y, Az? +2 are some examples of\n\nquadratic polynomials (whose coefficients are real numbers). More generally, any\nquadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax? + bx +c, where a, b, c are real numbers\nand a #0. A polynomial of degree 3 is called a cubic polynomial. Some examples of\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nPOLYNOMIALS Dy\n\na cubic polynomial are 2 — x7, x°, /2x°, 3-2? + x3, 3x3— 2x? + x— 1. In fact, the most\ngeneral form of a cubic polynomial is\n\nax? + bx? + cx + d,\nwhere, a, b, c, d are real numbers and a # 0.\n\nNow consider the polynomial p(x) = x° — 3x — 4. Then, putting x = 2 in the\npolynomial, we get p(2) = 2-3 x 2-4 =— 6. The value ‘— 6’, obtained by replacing\nx by 2 in x’ — 3x —4, is the value of x? — 3x— 4 at x = 2. Similarly, p(0) is the value of\nP(x) at x = 0, which is — 4.\n\nIf p(x) is a polynomial in x, and ifk is any real number, then the value obtained by\nreplacing x by k in p(x), is called the value of p(x) at x = k, and is denoted by p(A).\n\nWhat is the value of p(x) = x? -3x — 4 at x = —1? We have :\nP(-1) = (-1)’-{3 x (-1)} — 4 = 0\nAlso, note that p(4) =47-(3 x 4)-4=0.\nAs p(-1) = 0 and p(4) = 0, -1 and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic\n\npolynomial x* — 3x — 4. More generally, a real number k is said to be a zero of a\npolynomial p(x), if p(’) = 0.\n\nYou have already studied in Class [X, how to find the zeroes of a linear\n\npolynomial. For example, if k is a zero of p(x) = 2x + 3, then p(k) = 0 gives us\n\n3\n\n2k+3=0,i¢, k= se\n2 —\n\nIn general, if k is a zero of p(x) = ax + b, then p(k) = ak+ b=0,ie., k= 7\n\nSo, the zero of the linear polynomial ax + b is mu =— (Constant term)\n\na Coefficient of x\n\nThus, the zero of a linear polynomial is related to its coefficients. Does this\nhappen in the case of other polynomials too? For example, are the zeroes of a quadratic\npolynomial also related to its coefficients?\n\nIn this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. We will also study the\ndivision algorithm for polynomials.\n\n2.2 Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial\n\nYou know that a real number k is a zero of the polynomial p(x) if p(k) = 0. But why\nare the zeroes of a polynomial so important? To answer this, first we will see the\ngeometrical representations of linear and quadratic polynomials and the geometrical\nmeaning of their zeroes.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n13 MATHEMATICS\n\nConsider first a linear polynomial ax + b, a # 0. You have studied in Class IX that the\ngraph of y= ax + b is a straight line. For example, the graph of y = 2x + 3 is a straight\nline passing through the points (— 2, —1) and (2, 7).\n\nFrom Fig. 2.1, you can see\nthat the graph of y = 2x + 3\n\nintersects the x-axis mid-way\n\ni\n\nbetween x = —-1 and x = —2,\n\nthat is, at the point [-3. 0).\n\nYou also know that the zero of\n\nHHH\n\n2x + 3 is ->. Thus, the zero of\n\nthe polynomial 2x + 3 is the #33\n\nx-coordinate of the point where the\ngraph of y = 2x + 3 intersects the Fig. 2.1\n\nX-axis.\n\nIn general, for a linear polynomial ax + b, a #0, the graph of y= ax +bisa\nstraight line which intersects the x-axis at exactly one point, namely, (=. 0),\na\n\nTherefore, the linear polynomial ax + b, a # 0, has exactly one zero, namely, the\nx-coordinate of the point where the graph of y = ax + b intersects the x-axis.\n\nNow, let us look for the geometrical meaning of a zero of a quadratic polynomial.\nConsider the quadratic polynomial x* — 3x — 4. Let us see what the graph* of\ny =x’ — 3x —4 looks like. Let us list a few values of y =x? — 3x — 4 corresponding to\n\na few values for x as given in Table 2.1.\n\n* Plotting of graphs of quadratic or cubic polynomials is not meant to be done by the students,\nnor is to be evaluated.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 13\n\nTable 2.1\n\nIf we locate the points listed 4... rroaencan Tena sa\n\nabove on a graph paper and draw :\nthe graph, it will actually look like\nthe one given in Fig. 2.2.\n\nEEE\n\nIn fact, for any quadratic\npolynomial ax? + bx +c,a#0, the :\ngraph of the corresponding\nequation y = ax? + bx + c has one\nof the two shapes either open HEH\n\nHH\nHt\n\nupwards like \\J or open ie\n\ndownwards like /\\ depending on :\nwhether a > 0 or a < 0. (These # i i :\ncurves are called parabolas.) i\n\nHt\n\nYou can see from Table 2.1\nthat —1 and 4 are zeroes of the\nquadratic polynomial.

Thus, the 6)\nzeroes of the quadratic polynomial\nx? — 3x — 4 are x-coordinates of =] i\nthe points where the graph of .\ny = x? — 3x — 4 intersects the\nX-axis.\n\nCH\nHt\nHt\nvm\nvm\nH\n\nFig. 2.2\n\nThis fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic\npolynomial ax’? + bx + c,a #0, are precisely the x-coordinates of the points where the\nparabola representing y = ax? + bx +c intersects the x-axis.\n\nFrom our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of y = ax’ + bx +c, the\nfollowing three cases can happen:\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n14 MATHEMATICS\n\nCase (i) : Here, the graph cuts x-axis at two distinct points A and A’.\n\nThe x-coordinates of A and A’ are the two zeroes of the quadratic polynomial\nax? + bx + c in this case (see Fig. 2.3).\n\nPerrrerersrernen erreer errr ter seuss spt\nScitteasduanunien HaStStEE tae a i HH HH\ni i a i i\ni ie SELELEG duane REEEEEDL td a HH HH HH HH\ni\ni i a i i\niH ie SHE He a HH saci etttte\n€ -\niH ie Scitteas duane HaSEA G0 tba a ath i HH it\nH\nat at is isises senseateai ansisiast aitais ett HH sizeai insta HH HH\nEe eH aE E Pte Gueiie eet ae i H Baer : :\n(i) (ii)\nr A >\nFig. 2.3\n\nCase (ii) : Here, the graph cuts the x-axis at exactly one point, 1.e., at two coincident\npoints.

So, it does not cut the x-axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5).\n\nBriraverr vere Ut ees, L4 4 t } Perrier\nHt +H\ni\nct ct\nst tt + + +H +\nSEE Ht i i TH \"1 ene TH i 4 4\ntf tf\nia im 4 a\nrt = a\nff f H i H # # HH H\nzi\n+ +\ni B i EL EEEEEe Ht H Her\nPert Pt ee Ht Hitt HE HEH oe ct\nHt +E Het 4 Hf Hf\na saaaae tH 4 tf a\n: EH H H H\nEss:\nEte rt cH EEE rH\n+f Ht Ht +t\ni\n+ i: + i: H}\neotaid ianfesavey in EH EE HH EH H FH\nH Hf a Pt rH aa H rH\n+ Ht 4 4\n+ + rt\na = ce tt f\n4 E\nAt Ht rH rt TH +t r +f THT 1\n(i) (it)\n°\nFig. 2.5\n\nSo, the quadratic polynomial ax? + bx + c has no zero in this case.\n\nSo, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two\ndistinct zeroes or two equal zeroes (i.e., one zero), or no zero. This also means that a\npolynomial of degree 2 has atmost two zeroes.\n\nNow, what do you expect the geometrical meaning of the zeroes of a cubic\npolynomial to be? Let us find out. Consider the cubic polynomial x? — 4x. To see what\nthe graph of y =x? — 4x looks like, let us list a few values of y corresponding to a few\nvalues for x as shown in Table 2.2.\n\nTable 2.2\n\nLocating the points of the table on a graph paper and drawing the graph, we see\nthat the graph of y = x* — 4x actually looks like the one given in Fig. 2.6.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nWe see from the table above\nthat — 2, 0 and 2 are zeroes of the\ncubic polynomial x* — 4x. Observe\nthat —2, 0 and 2 are, in fact, the\nx-coordinates of the only points\n\nMATHEMATICS\n\nwhere the graph of y = x° — 4x\nintersects the x-axis. Since the curve\nmeets the x-axis in only these 3\npoints, their x-coordinates are the\nonly zeroes of the polynomial.\n\nLet us take a few more\nexamples. Consider the cubic\n\npolynomials x* and x* — x. We draw\n2\n\nthe graphs of y = x? and y=x* —x\nin Fig. 2.7 and Fig. 2.8 respectively.\n\nFig. 2.6\n= +\nSHH HE EH\nare\n+\nprairie : finite\nSHH He i EH EHH\nff\nff\npiri innaait HH eniits\nstraits ate danttaae fe\neee = ee\nSeer : peer\nSHEE EHH ss\nFig. 2.7 Fig. 2.8\n\n\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 17\n\nNote that 0 is the only zero of the polynomial x°. Also, from Fig. 2.7, you can see\nthat 0 is the x-coordinate of the only point where the graph of y = x? intersects the\nx-axis. Similarly, since x°—x°=x?(x—1), O and 1 are the only zeroes of the polynomial\nx? — x’, Also, from Fig. 2.8, these values are the x-coordinates of the only points\nwhere the graph of y = x* — x° intersects the x-axis.\n\nFrom the examples above, we see that there are at most 3 zeroes for any cubic\npolynomial. In other words, any polynomial of degree 3 can have at most three zeroes.\n\nRemark : In general, given a polynomial p(x) of degree n, the graph of y = p(x)\nintersects the x-axis at atmost 7 points. Therefore, a polynomial p(x) of degree n has\nat most n zeroes.\n\nExample 1 : Look at the graphs in Fig. 2.9 given below. Each is the graph of y = p(x),\nwhere p(x) is a polynomial.

We will now try\n\nto answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes\nand coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial,\nsay p(x) = 2x? — 8x + 6. In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic\npolynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term\n‘_ 8x’ as a sum of two terms, whose product is 6 x 2x? = 12x”. So, we write\n\n2x? — 8x + 6 = 2x? — 6x — 2x + 6 = 2x(x — 3) — 2(x — 3)\n= (2x — 2) — 3) = 2 — I - 3)\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 19\n\nSo, the value of p(x) = 2x? — 8x + 6 is zero when x — 1 = 0 or x —3 = 0, i.e., when\nx = 1 orx =3. So, the zeroes of 2x? — 8x + 6 are | and 3. Observe that :\n\n—(-8) _ —(Coefficient of x)\n2 Coefficient of x?\n6 Constant term\n\nProduct of its zeroes = 1X3 =3=—= ;\n2 Coefficient of x\n\nSum ofits zeroes = 14+3=4=\n\nLet us take one more quadratic polynomial, say, p(x) = 3x° + 5x — 2. By the\nmethod of splitting the middle term,\n\n3x? + 5x—-2 = 3x? + 6x —x —2 = 3x(x + 2) -l(x + 2)\n= (3x — 1)(x + 2)\n\nHence, the value of 3x? + 5x —2 is zero when either 3x - 1 =0 orx +2 =0, ie.,\n\n1 1\nwhen x = 3 or x = —2. So, the zeroes of 3x? + 5x —2 are 3 and — 2.

Recall\nthat if p(x) is a polynomial in x, the highest power of x in p(x) is called the degree of\nthe polynomial p(x). For example, 4x + 2 is a polynomial in the variable x of\n\ndegree 1, 2y?— 3y + 4 is a polynomial in the variable y of degree 2, 5x? — 4x? + x— /2\n\n3\nis a polynomial in the variable x of degree 3 and 7u°— mul + 4u* +u—-8 isa polynomial\n\n1\n3 Vx +2, zn ete., are\n\nin the variable u of degree 6.

Polynomials\n\nsuch as 2x + 5 —x?, x° + 1, etc., are not linear polynomials.\n\nA polynomial of degree 2 is called a quadratic polynomial.

In fact, the most\ngeneral form of a cubic polynomial is\n\nax? + bx? + cx + d,\nwhere, a, b, c, d are real numbers and a # 0.\n\nNow consider the polynomial p(x) = x° — 3x — 4. Then, putting x = 2 in the\npolynomial, we get p(2) = 2-3 x 2-4 =— 6. The value ‘— 6’, obtained by replacing\nx by 2 in x’ — 3x —4, is the value of x? — 3x— 4 at x = 2. Similarly, p(0) is the value of\nP(x) at x = 0, which is — 4.\n\nIf p(x) is a polynomial in x, and ifk is any real number, then the value obtained by\nreplacing x by k in p(x), is called the value of p(x) at x = k, and is denoted by p(A).\n\nWhat is the value of p(x) = x? -3x — 4 at x = —1? We have :\nP(-1) = (-1)’-{3 x (-1)} — 4 = 0\nAlso, note that p(4) =47-(3 x 4)-4=0.\nAs p(-1) = 0 and p(4) = 0, -1 and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic\n\npolynomial x* — 3x — 4. More generally, a real number k is said to be a zero of a\npolynomial p(x), if p(’) = 0.\n\nYou have already studied in Class [X, how to find the zeroes of a linear\n\npolynomial. For example, if k is a zero of p(x) = 2x + 3, then p(k) = 0 gives us\n\n3\n\n2k+3=0,i¢, k= se\n2 —\n\nIn general, if k is a zero of p(x) = ax + b, then p(k) = ak+ b=0,ie., k= 7\n\nSo, the zero of the linear polynomial ax + b is mu =— (Constant term)\n\na Coefficient of x\n\nThus, the zero of a linear polynomial is related to its coefficients. Does this\nhappen in the case of other polynomials too? For example, are the zeroes of a quadratic\npolynomial also related to its coefficients?\n\nIn this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. We will also study the\ndivision algorithm for polynomials.\n\n2.2 Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial\n\nYou know that a real number k is a zero of the polynomial p(x) if p(k) = 0. But why\nare the zeroes of a polynomial so important? To answer this, first we will see the\ngeometrical representations of linear and quadratic polynomials and the geometrical\nmeaning of their zeroes.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

She wanted to enjoy rides on the Giant Wheel\nand play Hoopla (a game in which you throw a ring on the items kept in a stall, and if\nthe ring covers any object completely, you get it). The number of times she played\nHoopla is half the number of rides she had on the Giant Wheel. If each ride costs\n= 3, and a game of Hoopla costs ¥ 4, how would you find out the number of rides she\nhad and how many times she played Hoopla, provided she spent % 20.\n\nMay be you will try it by considering different cases. If she has one ride, is it\npossible? Is it possible to have two rides? And so on. Or you may use the knowledge\nof Class IX, to represent such situations as linear equations in two variables.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nPair OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 25\n\nLet us try this approach.\n\nDenote the number of rides that Akhila had by x, and the number of times she\nplayed Hoopla by y. Now the situation can be represented by the two equations:\n\n1\ny= ae (1)\n3x + 4y = 20 (2)\n\nCan we find the solutions of this pair of equations? There are several ways of\nfinding these, which we will study in this chapter.\n\n3.2. Graphical Method of Solution of a Pair of Linear Equations\n\nA pair of linear equations which has no solution, is called an inconsistent pair of linear\nequations. A pair of linear equations in two variables, which has a solution, is called a\nconsistent pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations which are equivalent has\ninfinitely many distinct common solutions. Such a pair is called a dependent pair of\nlinear equations in two variables. Note that a dependent pair of linear equations is\nalways consistent.\n\nWe can now summarise the behaviour of lines representing a pair of linear equations\nin two variables and the existence of solutions as follows:\n\n(i) the lines may intersect in a single point. In this case, the pair of equations\nhas a unique solution (consistent pair of equations).\n\nii) the lines may be parallel. In this case, the equations have no solution\ny be p q\n(inconsistent pair of equations).\n\n(iti) the lines may be coincident. In this case, the equations have infinitely many\nsolutions [dependent (consistent) pair of equations].\nConsider the following three pairs of equations.\n(i) x -—2y =0 and 3x + 4y—-20=0 (The lines intersect)\n(ii) 2x + 3y—9=Oand 4x +6y—18=0 (The lines coincide)\n(it) x +2y—4=0 and 2x+4y—12=0 (The lines are parallel)\n\nay\n\nb\n»—- and in all the\n\nLet us now write down, and compare, the values of a a\n2 2 2\n\nthree examples. Here, a,, b,, c, and a,, b,, c, denote the coefficents of equations\ngiven in the general form in Section 3.2.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n26 MATHEMATICS\n\nTable 3.1\n\nFrom the table above, you can observe that if the lines represented by the equation\n\nax+by+c,=0\n\nand a,x +-b,y+c, = 0\n\\ . b\nare (i) intersecting, then Mig 1.\nad, db,\n\n.. . a ob  ¢\n(ii) coincident, then —- = =—.\na, db &\n\nee 4 _h 4\n(iti) parallel, then —= — # —-\na MY Cy\nIn fact, the converse is also true for any pair of lines. You can verify them by\nconsidering some more examples by yourself.\n\nLet us now consider some more examples to illustrate it.\n\nExample 1 : Check graphically whether the pair of equations\n\nx+3y=6 (1)\nand 2x —3y = 12 (2)\nis consistent. If so, solve them graphically.\n\nSolution : Let us draw the graphs of the Equations (1) and (2). For this, we find two\nsolutions of each of the equations, which are given in Table 3.2\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nPair OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWo VARIABLES 27\n\nTable 3.2\n\nPlot the points A(O, 2), B(6, 0),\nP(O, — 4) and Q(3, — 2) on graph A (0,\npaper, and join the points to form the\n\nlines AB and PQ as shown in\nFig. 3.1. ¢ 1\n\nWe observe that there is a point\nB (6, 0) common to both the lines a3:::::2i:is isis tig gee Rin tititetceaeirtatacsctitatie\nAB and PQ. So, the solution of the i\npair of linear equations is x = 6 and\n\ny=0,i.e., the given pair of equations\n\nis consistent.\n\nFig. 3.1\n\nExample 2 : Graphically, find whether the following pair of equations has no solution,\nunique solution or infinitely many solutions:\n\n5x-8y+1=0 (1)\n3 - P 0 2\nSolution : Multiplying Equation (2) by 3° we get\n5x-8y+1=0\n\nBut, this is the same as Equation (1). Hence the lines represented by Equations (1)\nand (2) are coincident. Therefore, Equations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions.\n\nPlot few points on the graph and verify it yourself.\n\nExample 3 : Champa went to a ‘Sale’ to purchase some pants and skirts. When her\nfriends asked her how many of each she had bought, she answered, “The number of\nskirts is two less than twice the number of pants purchased. Also, the number of skirts\nis four less than four times the number of pants purchased”. Help her friends to find\nhow many pants and skirts Champa bought.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n28 MATHEMATICS\n\nSolution : Let us denote the number of pants by x and the number of skirts by y.

Algebraic Methods of Solving a Pair of Linear Equations\n\nIn the previous section, we discussed how to solve a pair of linear equations graphically.\nThe graphical method is not convenient in cases when the point representing the\n\nsolution of the linear equations has non-integral coordinates like (V3. 27),\n\n4 ]\n(-1.75, 3.3), <. 4) , etc. There is every possibility of making mistakes while reading\n\nsuch coordinates. Is there any alternative method of finding the solution? There are\nseveral algebraic methods, which we shall now discuss.\n\n3.3.1 Substitution Method : We shall explain the method of substitution by taking\nsome examples.\nExample 4 : Solve the following pair of equations by substitution method:\nTx — 15y = 2 (1)\nx+2y= 3 (2)\nSolution :\nStep 1 : We pick either of the equations and write one variable in terms of the other.\nLet us consider the Equation (2) :\nx+2y=3\nand write it as x= 3-2y (3)\nStep 2 : Substitute the value of x in Equation (1). We get\n73 -2y)- 15y = 2\n\nLe., 21-—14y- 15y= 2\n\nLe., —29y = -19\n19\n\nTherefore, y= 39\n\nStep 3 : Substituting this value of y in Equation (3), we get\n\n19 49\n= — 2} —|=—\nx= 3 (2) 29\n49 19\n\nTherefore, the solution is x = 39 y= 29 .\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nPair OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWo VARIABLES 31\n\n49 19\nVerification : Substituting x= 39 and y= 39 7 Youcan verify that both the Equations\n\n(1) and (2) are satisfied.\nTo understand the substitution method more clearly, let us consider it stepwise:\n\nStep 1 : Find the value of one variable, say y in terms of the other variable, i.e., x from\neither equation, whichever is convenient.\n\nStep 2 : Substitute this value of y in the other equation, and reduce it to an equation in\none variable, i.e., in terms of x, which can be solved. Sometimes, as in Examples 9 and\n10 below, you can get statements with no variable. If this statement is true, you can\nconclude that the pair of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. If the statement\nis false, then the pair of linear equations is inconsistent.\n\nStep 3 : Substitute the value of x (or y) obtained in Step 2 in the equation used in\nStep 1 to obtain the value of the other variable.\n\nRemark : We have substituted the value of one variable by expressing it in terms of\nthe other variable to solve the pair of linear equations. That is why the method is\nknown as the substitution method.\n\nExample 5 : Solve the following question—Aftab tells his daughter, “Seven years\nago, I was seven times as old as you were then. Also, three years from now, I shall be\nthree times as old as you will be.” (Isn’t this interesting?) Represent this situation\nalgebraically and graphically by the method of substitution.\n\nSolution : Let s and t be the ages (in years) of Aftab and his daughter, respectively.\nThen, the pair of linear equations that represent the situation is\n\ns-7=7(t-7), Le. s—7t+42=0 (1)\nand s+3=3 (f+ 3), Le. s—3t=6 (2)\nUsing Equation (2), we get s = 3r+ 6.\nPutting this value of s in Equation (1), we get\n\n(3t+ 6)-7t+42= 0,\n1.e., 4t= 48, which gives t= 12.\nPutting this value of ¢ in Equation (2), we get\ns= 3(12)+6=42\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n32 MATHEMATICS\n\nSo, Aftab and his daughter are 42 and 12 years old, respectively.\n\nVerify this answer by checking if it satisfies the conditions of the given problems.\nExample 6: In a shop the cost of 2 pencils and 3 erasers is 9 and the cost of 4\npencils and 6 erasers is §18. Find the cost of each pencil and each eraser.\n\nSolution : The pair of linear equations formed were:\n\n2x +3y=9 (1)\n4x + 6y = 18 (2)\nWe first express the value of x in terms of y from the equation 2x + 3y = 9, to get\n9-—3y\nx= TZ (3)\n\nNow we substitute this value of x in Equation (2), to get\n\n49-3\n\na +6y= 18\ni.e., 18 — 6y + 6y = 18\nLe., 18= 18\n\nThis statement is true for all values of y. However, we do not get a specific\nvalue of y as a solution. Therefore, we cannot obtain a specific value of x. This\nsituation has arisen because both the given equations are the same. Therefore,\nEquations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions. We cannot find a unique\ncost of a pencil and an eraser, because there are many common solutions, to the\ngiven situation.\n\nExample 7 : Two rails are represented by the equations\nx+2y—4=0O and 2x+4y—-—12=0. Will the rails cross each other?\n\nSolution : The pair of linear equations formed were:\n\nx+2y-4=0 (1)\n2x+4y-12= 0 (2)\nWe express x in terms of y from Equation (1) to get\nx=4-2y\n\nNow, we substitute this value of x in Equation (2) to get\n2(4 — 2y)+4y-12= 0\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nPair OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 33\n1€., 8—12=0\n\n1€., -4=0\n\nwhich is a false statement.\n\nTherefore, the equations do not have a common solution. So, the two rails will not\ncross each other.\n\nEXERCISE 3.2\n\n1.

Five years\nago, Jacob’s age was seven times that of his son. What are their present ages?\n\n3.3.2 Elimination Method\n\nNow let us consider another method of eliminating (i.e., removing) one variable. This\niS Sometimes more convenient than the substitution method. Let us see how this method\nworks.\n\nExample 8 : The ratio of incomes of two persons is 9 : 7 and the ratio of their\nexpenditures is 4 : 3. If each of them manages to save ~ 2000 per month, find their\nmonthly incomes.\n\nSolution : Let us denote the incomes of the two person by % 9x and % 7x and their\nexpenditures by % 4y and & 3y respectively. Then the equations formed in the situation\nis given by:\n\n9x — 4y = 2000 (1)\nand 7x — 3y = 2000 (2)\n\nStep 1 : Multiply Equation (1) by 3 and Equation (2) by 4 to make the coefficients of\ny equal. Then we get the equations:\n\n27x — 12y = 6000 (3)\n28x — 12y = 8000 (4)\n\nStep 2 : Subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4) to eliminate y, because the coefficients\nof y are the same. So, we get\n\n(28x — 27x) — (12y = 12v) = 8000-6000\n1e., x = 2000\nStep 3 : Substituting this value of x in (1), we get\n9(2000) — 4v = 2000\n1.€., y = 4000\n\nSo, the solution of the equations is x = 2000, vy = 4000. Therefore, the monthly incomes\nof the persons are = 18,000 and = 14,000, respectively.\n\nVerification : 18000 : 14000 = 9 : 7. Also, the ratio of their expenditures =\n18000 — 2000 : 14000 — 2000 = 16000 : 12000 =4: 3\n\nRemarks :\n\n1. The method used in solving the example above is called the elimination method,\nbecause we eliminate one variable first, to get a linear equation in one variable.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nPair OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 35\n\nIn the example above, we eliminated y. We could also have eliminated x. Try\ndoing it that way.\n\n2. You could also have used the substitution, or graphical method, to solve this\nproblem. Try doing so, and see which method is more convenient.\n\nLet us now note down these steps in the elimination method :\nStep 1 : First multiply both the equations by some suitable non-zero constants to make\nthe coefficients of one variable (either x or vy) numerically equal.\n\nStep 2 : Then add or subtract one equation from the other so that one variable gets\neliminated. If you get an equation in one variable, go to Step 3.\n\nIf in Step 2, we obtain a true statement involving no variable, then the original\npair of equations has infinitely many solutions.\n\nIf in Step 2, we obtain a false statement involving no variable, then the original\npair of equations has no solution, i.e., it is inconsistent.\n\nStep 3 : Solve the equation in one variable (x or y) so obtained to get its value.\n\nStep 4: Substitute this value of x (or y) in either of the original equations to get the\nvalue of the other variable.\n\nNow to illustrate it, we shall solve few more examples.\n\nExample 9 : Use elimination method to find all possible solutions of the following pair\nof linear equations :\n\n2x + 3y = 8 (1)\n4x+ 6y= 7 (2)\n\nSolution :\n\nStep 1 : Multiply Equation (1) by 2 and Equation (2) by 1 to make the\ncoefficients of x equal. Then we get the equations as :\n4x + 6y = 16 (3)\n4x+6y=7 (4)\nStep 2 : Subtracting Equation (4) from Equation (3),\n(4x — 4x) + (6y — 6y) = 16-7\n1.€., 0 = 9, which is a false statement.\n\nTherefore, the pair of equations has no solution.\n\nExample 10 : The sum of a two-digit number and the number obtained by reversing\nthe digits is 66. If the digits of the number differ by 2, find the number. How many such\nnumbers are there?\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n36 MATHEMATICS\n\nSolution : Let the ten’s and the unit’s digits in the first number be x and y, respectively.\nSo, the first number may be written as 10x + y in the expanded form (for example,\n56 = 10(5) + 6).\n\nWhen the digits are reversed, x becomes the unit’s digit and y becomes the ten’s\ndigit. This number, in the expanded notation is 10y + x (for example, when 56 is\nreversed, we get 65 = 10(6) + 5).\n\nAccording to the given condition.\n(10x + y) + (10y + x) = 66\n\nLS. 1l(x+y) = 66\n\ni.e., x+y=6 (1)\nWe are also given that the digits differ by 2, therefore,\n\neither x-y=2 (2)\nor y-x=2 (3)\n\nIf x —y = 2, then solving (1) and (2) by elimination, we get x =4 and y =2.\nIn this case, we get the number 42.\n\nIf y —x = 2, then solving (1) and (3) by elimination, we getx =2 and y =4.\nIn this case, we get the number 24.\nThus, there are two such numbers 42 and 24.\nVerification : Here 42 + 24 = 66 and 4 — 2 = 2. Also 24 + 42 = 66 and 4-2 =2.\n\nEXERCISE 3.3\n\n1. Solve the following pair of linear equations by the elimination method and the substitution\n\nmethod :\n(i) x+y=5 and 2x—3y=4 (ii) 3x+4y=10 and 2x—2y=2\nx 2\n(ii) 3x-Sy—4=0 and 9x=2y+7 (iv) stp acland-2=3\n\n2.

Then we get the equations:\n\n27x — 12y = 6000 (3)\n28x — 12y = 8000 (4)\n\nStep 2 : Subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4) to eliminate y, because the coefficients\nof y are the same. So, we get\n\n(28x — 27x) — (12y = 12v) = 8000-6000\n1e., x = 2000\nStep 3 : Substituting this value of x in (1), we get\n9(2000) — 4v = 2000\n1.€., y = 4000\n\nSo, the solution of the equations is x = 2000, vy = 4000. Therefore, the monthly incomes\nof the persons are = 18,000 and = 14,000, respectively.\n\nVerification : 18000 : 14000 = 9 : 7.

One type was the\nquadratic polynomial of the form ax? + bx + c, a # 0. When we equate this polynomial\nto zero, we get a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations come up when we deal with\nmany real-life situations. For instance, suppose a\ncharity trust decides to build a prayer hall having\na carpet area of 300 square metres with its length\none metre more than twice its breadth. What\nshould be the length and breadth of the hall?\nSuppose the breadth of the hall is x metres. Then, xw+1\nits length should be (2x + 1) metres. We can depict\n\nthis information pictorially as shown in Fig. 4.1. Fig. 4.1\n\nNow, area of the hall = (2x + 1). x m? = (2x? + x) m?\nSo, 2x? +x = 300 (Given)\nTherefore, 2x? +x — 300 = 0\n\nSo, the breadth of the hall should satisfy the equation 2x? + x — 300 = 0 which is a\nquadratic equation.\n\nx 300 m2\n\nMany people believe that Babylonians were the first to solve quadratic equations.\nFor instance, they knew how to find two positive numbers with a given positive sum\nand a given positive product, and this problem is equivalent to solving a quadratic\nequation of the form x? — px + q = 0. Greek mathematician Euclid developed a\ngeometrical approach for finding out lengths which, in our present day terminology,\nare solutions of quadratic equations. Solving of quadratic equations, in general form, is\noften credited to ancient Indian mathematicians. In fact, Brahmagupta (C.E.598—665)\ngave an explicit formula to solve a quadratic equation of the form ax’ + bx = c. Later,\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nQUADRATIC EQUATIONS 39\n\nSridharacharya (C.E. 1025) derived a formula, now known as the quadratic formula,\n(as quoted by Bhaskara II) for solving a quadratic equation by the method of completing\nthe square. An Arab mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (about C.E. 800) also studied\nquadratic equations of different types. Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi, in his book\n‘Liber embadorum’ published in Europe in C.E. 1145 gave complete solutions of\ndifferent quadratic equations.\n\nIn this chapter, you will study quadratic equations, and various ways of finding\ntheir roots. You will also see some applications of quadratic equations in daily life\nsituations.\n\n4.2 Quadratic Equations\n\nA quadratic equation in the variable x is an equation of the form ax? + bx +c =0, where\na, b, c are real numbers, a # 0. For example, 2x” + x — 300 = 0 is a quadratic equation.\nSimilarly, 2x? — 3x + 1 = 0, 4x — 3x? + 2 = 0 and 1 — x + 300 = 0 are also quadratic\nequations.\n\nIn fact, any equation of the form p(x) = 0, where p(x) is a polynomial of degree\n2, is a quadratic equation. But when we write the terms of p(x) in descending order of\ntheir degrees, then we get the standard form of the equation. That is, ax? + bx +c =0,\na # 0 is called the standard form of a quadratic equation.\n\nQuadratic equations arise in several situations in the world around us and in\ndifferent fields of mathematics. Let us consider a few examples.\nExample 1 : Represent the following situations mathematically:\n\n(i) John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and\nthe product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find\nout how many marbles they had to start with.\n\n(ii) A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of\nproduction of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toys\nproduced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was\n= 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day.\n\nSolution :\n(i) Let the number of marbles John had be x.\nThen the number of marbles Jivanti had = 45 — x (Why’?).\nThe number of marbles left with John, when he lost 5 marbles = x — 5\nThe number of marbles left with Jivanti, when she lost 5 marbles = 45 — x —5\n= 40-x\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n40 MATHEMATICS\n\nTherefore, their product = (x — 5) (40 — x)\n= 40x — x? — 200 + 5x\n\n=—x?+ 45x — 200\nSo, — x? + 45x — 200 = 124 (Given that product = 124)\nie,  —2°+45x-324=0\ni.e., x? — 45x + 324 = 0\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles John had, satisfies the quadratic equation\nx’ — 45x + 324 = 0\nwhich is the required representation of the problem mathematically.\n(ii) Let the number of toys produced on that day be x.\nTherefore, the cost of production (in rupees) of each toy that day = 55 — x\nSo, the total cost of production (in rupees) that day = x (55 —x)\n\nTherefore, x (55 —x) = 750\nL.e., 55x —x* = 750\nL.e., —x?+ 55x — 750 = 0\ni.€., x? — 55x + 750 = 0\n\nTherefore, the number of toys produced that day satisfies the quadratic equation\nx’ — 55x + 750 = 0\n\nwhich is the required representation of the problem mathematically.\n\nExample 2 : Check whether the following are quadratic equations:\n(i) (x-2Y+1=2x-3 (ii) x(x + 1) +8 =(x + 2) (x —-2)\n\n(iii) x (2x +3)=x2+1 (iv) (x +2 =2x3—4\n\nSolution :\nG) LHS =(4-2)+1=x°-44+4+1=2x°-4x+5\n\nTherefore, (x — 2)?+ 1 = 2x —3 can be rewritten as\nx 4x +5 = 2x-3\nL.e., x-6x+8=0\n\nIt is of the form ax? + bx + c= 0.\n\nTherefore, the given equation is a quadratic equation.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nQUADRATIC EQUATIONS\n\n(ii)\n\n(iil)\n\n(iv)\n\nSince x(x + 1) + 8 =x? +x+ 8 and (x + 2)(x—- 2) =x?-4\n\nTherefore, xXP+x+8=x7-4\n\n1.€., x+12=0\n\nIt is not of the form ax? + bx + c= 0.\n\nTherefore, the given equation is not a quadratic equation.\n\nHere, LHS = x (2x + 3) = 2x? + 3x\n\nSo, x (2x + 3) = x? + 1 can be rewritten as\n2x? + 3x= x7? +1\n\nTherefore, we get x°+3x—-1=0\n\nIt is of the form ax? + bx +c =0.\n\nSo, the given equation is a quadratic equation.\n\nHere, LHS = (x + 2)? = x3 + 6x? + 12x +8\n\nTherefore, (x + 2)? = x° — 4 can be rewritten as\net 6° + 12x+8 =x -4\n\ni.e., 6x°?+12x+12=0 or, x+2x+2=0\n\nIt is of the form ax? + bx + c= 0.\n\nSo, the given equation is a quadratic equation.\n\n41\n\nRemark : Be careful! In (ii) above, the given equation appears to be a quadratic\nequation, but it is not a quadratic equation.\n\nIn (iv) above, the given equation appears to be a cubic equation (an equation of\n\ndegree 3) and not a quadratic equation. But it turns out to be a quadratic equation. As\nyou can see, often we need to simplify the given equation before deciding whether it\nis quadratic or not.\n\nEXERCISE 4.1\n\n1.

We need to find the length and breadth of the plot.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n42 MATHEMATICS\n\n(ii) The product of two consecutive positive integers is 306. We need to find the\nintegers.\n\n(ii) Rohan’s mother is 26 years older than him. The product of their ages (in years)\n3 years from now will be 360. We would like to find Rohan’s present age.\n\n(iv) A train travels a distance of 480 km at a uniform speed. If the speed had been\n8 km/h less, then it would have taken 3 hours more to cover the same distance. We\nneed to find the speed of the train.\n\n4.3 Solution of a Quadratic Equation by Factorisation\n\nConsider the quadratic equation 2x? — 3x + 1 = 0. If we replace x by 1 on the\nLHS of this equation, we get (2 x 1°) — (3 x 1) + 1 = 0 = RHS of the equation.\nWe say that | is a root of the quadratic equation 2x? — 3x + 1 = 0. This also means that\n1 is a zero of the quadratic polynomial 2x? — 3x + 1.\n\nIn general, a real number © is called a root of the quadratic equation\nax’ + bx +c=0,a40ifao’+ba+c=0. We also say that x = a is a solution of\nthe quadratic equation, or that o satisfies the quadratic equation. Note that the\nzeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax’ + bx + c and the roots of the quadratic\nequation ax’ + bx + c= 0 are the same.\n\nYou have observed, in Chapter 2, that a quadratic polynomial can have at most\ntwo zeroes. So, any quadratic equation can have atmost two roots.\n\nYou have learnt in Class IX, how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting\ntheir middle terms. We shall use this knowledge for finding the roots of a quadratic\nequation. Let us see how.\n\nExample 3 : Find the roots of the equation 2x” — 5x + 3 = 0, by factorisation.\nSolution : Let us first split the middle term — 5x as —2x —3x [because (—2x) x (—3x) =\n6x? = (2x7) x 3].\n\nSo, 2x?-— 5x +3 = 2x? -— 2x—-—3x+3 =2x (x-1)-3@-1) =(Qx-3)a-1)\nNow, 2x? — 5x + 3 = 0 can be rewritten as (2x — 3)(x — 1) = 0.\n\nSo, the values of x for which 2x\" — 5x + 3 = 0 are the same for which (2x — 3)(x — 1) =0,\ni.e., either 2x -3 = 0 orx—1=0.\n\n3\nNow, 2x — 3 = 0 gives x=5 and x— 1=0 gives x= 1.\n3\nSo, X= 5 and x = | are the solutions of the equation.\n\n3\nIn other words, 1 and 5 are the roots of the equation 2x? — 5x +3=0.\n\nVerify that these are the roots of the given equation.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nQUADRATIC EQUATIONS 43\n\nNote that we have found the roots of 2x? — 5x + 3 = 0 by factorising\n2x* — 5x + 3 into two linear factors and equating each factor to zero.\n\nExample 4 : Find the roots of the quadratic equation 6x? — x — 2 = 0.\nSolution : We have\n6x? —x —2 = 6x? + 3x —4x —2\n= 3x (2x + 1)-2 (2x + 1)\n= (3x —2)(2x + 1)\nThe roots of 6x? — x — 2 = 0 are the values of x for which (3x — 2)(2x + 1) =0\nTherefore, 3x —2 = 0 or 2x + 1 =0,\n\n1.€., x=\n\n2\nTherefore, the roots of 6x2 — x — 2 = 0 are 5 and =\"\n\n2 1\nWe verify the roots, by checking that 3 and ~,, satisfy 6x? -x-2=0.\nExample 5 : Find the roots of the quadratic equation 3x7 — 26 x+2=0.\n\nSolution : 3x? —2./6x2 = 3x? —J6x—J6x+2\n= ¥3x(J3x- 2) - v2(V3x- v2)\n= (V3x- V2)(V3x-v2)\n\nSo, the roots of the equation are the values of x for which\n\n(J3 x-2)(V3x - V2) =0\n\n2\nNow, /3x—J2 =0 for ve?\n\nSo, this root is repeated twice, one for each repeated factor V3x—J2 .\n\nTherefore, the roots of 3? —~2J6x+2 =() are fe. 2.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n44 MATHEMATICS\n\nExample 6 : Find the dimensions of the prayer hall discussed in Section 4.1.\n\nSolution : In Section 4.1, we found that if the breadth of the hall is x m, then x\nsatisfies the equation 2x* + x — 300 = 0. Applying the factorisation method, we write\nthis equation as\n\n2x? — 24x + 25x — 300 = 0\n2x (x — 12) +25 «- 12) = 0\ni.e., (x — 12)(2x + 25) = 0\n\nSo, the roots of the given equation are x = 12 or x =— 12.5. Since x is the breadth\nof the hall, it cannot be negative.\n\nThus, the breadth of the hall is 12 m. Its length = 2x + 1 =25 m.\n\nEXERCISE 4.2\n\n1. Find the roots of the following quadratic equations by factorisation:\n(i) x°-3x-10=0 (ii) 2x*+x-6=0\n1\n(ii) 2x? +7x+5V2 =0 (iv) 2x°—x4+ 2 =0\n(v) 100x?—20x+1=0\n.

If the total cost of production on that\nday was % 90, find the number of articles produced and the cost of each article.\n\n4.4 Nature of Roots\n\nThe equation ax’ + bx + c= 0 are given by\n\n—b+ \\b- 4ac\n\n“~ 2a\n\noe b\nIf b? — 4ac > 0, we get two distinct real roots -— +\n\na 2a\nb Jb? — 4ac\n\n2a 2a\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nQUADRATIC EQUATIONS 45\n\nb\n2 = = -— +0, ie, x =-— or ——-\nIf b? — 4ac = 0, then x oa , x aa Da\n\n—b\nSo, the roots of the equation ax? + bx + c = 0 are both oq\na\n\nTherefore, we say that the quadratic equation ax’ + bx + c = 0 has two equal\nreal roots in this case.\n\nIf 6? — 4ac <0, then there is no real number whose square is b” — 4ac. Therefore,\nthere are no real roots for the given quadratic equation in this case.\nSince b? — 4ac determines whether the quadratic equation ax’ + bx + c = 0 has\nreal roots or not, b? — 4ac is called the discriminant of this quadratic equation.\nSo, a quadratic equation ax* + bx + c =0 has\n(i) two distinct real roots, if b? — 4ac > 0,\n(ii) two equal real roots, if b? — 4ac = 0,\n(iii) no real roots, if b? — 4ac < 0.\n\nLet us consider some examples.\n\nExample 7: Find the discriminant of the quadratic equation 2x? — 4x + 3 = 0, and\nhence find the nature of its roots.\n\nSolution : The given equation is of the form ax” + bx + c= 0, where a =2, b=—4 and\nc= 3. Therefore, the discriminant\n\nb’ — 4ac = (- 49° = (4x 2 x 3) = 16-24=-8 <0\n\nSo, the given equation has no real roots.\n\nExample 8 : A pole has to be erected at a point on the boundary of a circular park of\ndiameter 13 metres in such a way that the differences of its distances from two\ndiametrically opposite fixed gates A and B on the boundary is 7 metres. Is it possible to\ndo so? If yes, at what distances from the two gates should the pole be erected?\n\nSolution : Let us first draw the diagram\n(see Fig. 4.2).\n\nLet P be the required location of the\npole. Let the distance of the pole from the\ngate B be x m, i.e., BP = x m. Now the\ndifference of the distances of the pole from\nthe two gates = AP — BP (or, BP — AP) =\n7m. Therefore, AP = (x + 7) m.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n46 MATHEMATICS\n\nNow, AB = 13m, and since AB is a diameter,\nZAPB = 90° (Why?)\n\nTherefore, AP? + PB? = AB? (By Pythagoras theorem)\ni.e., (x +7)? + x*= 13?\nL.e., x? + 14x + 49+x?= 169\nLés 2x? + 14x — 120 = 0\nSo, the distance ‘x’ of the pole from gate B satisfies the equation\nx’ + Tx - 60 = 0\n\nSo, it would be possible to place the pole if this equation has real roots. To see if this\nis so or not, let us consider its discriminant. The discriminant is\n\nb? —4ac = 7 —4 x 1 x (60) = 289>0.\n\nSo, the given quadratic equation has two real roots, and it is possible to erect the\npole on the boundary of the park.\n\nSolving the quadratic equation x? + 7x — 60 =0, by the quadratic formula, we get\n\n7+ 289 — -T+17\n2 2\n\nTherefore, x = 5 or — 12.\n\nSince x is the distance between the pole and the gate B, it must be positive.\nTherefore, x =— 12 will have to be ignored. So, x = 5.\n\nThus, the pole has to be erected on the boundary of the park at a distance of 5m\nfrom the gate B and 12m from the gate A.\n\n1\nExample 9 : Find the discriminant of the equation 3x? — 2x + 37 0 and hence find the\nnature of its roots. Find them, if they are real.\n\n1\nSolution : Here a = 3, b =— 2 and cas.\n\n1\nTherefore, discriminant b* — 4ac = (— 2)?- 4.x 3 x 3 4-4=0.\n\nHence, the given quadratic equation has two equal real roots.\n\nTh t =) = 1.e 22 1.e\ne roots are Pe ale a Re\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nQUADRATIC EQUATIONS 47\n\nEXERCISE 4.3\n\n.

One type was the\nquadratic polynomial of the form ax? + bx + c, a # 0. When we equate this polynomial\nto zero, we get a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations come up when we deal with\nmany real-life situations. For instance, suppose a\ncharity trust decides to build a prayer hall having\na carpet area of 300 square metres with its length\none metre more than twice its breadth. What\nshould be the length and breadth of the hall?\nSuppose the breadth of the hall is x metres. Then, xw+1\nits length should be (2x + 1) metres. We can depict\n\nthis information pictorially as shown in Fig. 4.1. Fig. 4.1\n\nNow, area of the hall = (2x + 1). x m? = (2x? + x) m?\nSo, 2x? +x = 300 (Given)\nTherefore, 2x? +x — 300 = 0\n\nSo, the breadth of the hall should satisfy the equation 2x? + x — 300 = 0 which is a\nquadratic equation.\n\nx 300 m2\n\nMany people believe that Babylonians were the first to solve quadratic equations.\nFor instance, they knew how to find two positive numbers with a given positive sum\nand a given positive product, and this problem is equivalent to solving a quadratic\nequation of the form x? — px + q = 0. Greek mathematician Euclid developed a\ngeometrical approach for finding out lengths which, in our present day terminology,\nare solutions of quadratic equations. Solving of quadratic equations, in general form, is\noften credited to ancient Indian mathematicians. In fact, Brahmagupta (C.E.598—665)\ngave an explicit formula to solve a quadratic equation of the form ax’ + bx = c. Later,\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

        "text": "QUADRATIC EQUATIONS 39\n\nSridharacharya (C.E. 1025) derived a formula, now known as the quadratic formula,\n(as quoted by Bhaskara II) for solving a quadratic equation by the method of completing\nthe square. An Arab mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (about C.E. 800) also studied\nquadratic equations of different types. Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi, in his book\n‘Liber embadorum’ published in Europe in C.E. 1145 gave complete solutions of\ndifferent quadratic equations.\n\nIn this chapter, you will study quadratic equations, and various ways of finding\ntheir roots. You will also see some applications of quadratic equations in daily life\nsituations.\n\n4.2 Quadratic Equations\n\nA quadratic equation in the variable x is an equation of the form ax? + bx +c =0, where\na, b, c are real numbers, a # 0. For example, 2x” + x — 300 = 0 is a quadratic equation.\nSimilarly, 2x? — 3x + 1 = 0, 4x — 3x? + 2 = 0 and 1 — x + 300 = 0 are also quadratic\nequations.\n\nIn fact, any equation of the form p(x) = 0, where p(x) is a polynomial of degree\n2, is a quadratic equation. But when we write the terms of p(x) in descending order of\ntheir degrees, then we get the standard form of the equation. That is, ax? + bx +c =0,\na # 0 is called the standard form of a quadratic equation.\n\nQuadratic equations arise in several situations in the world around us and in\ndifferent fields of mathematics. Let us consider a few examples.\nExample 1 : Represent the following situations mathematically:\n\n(i) John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and\nthe product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find\nout how many marbles they had to start with.\n\n(ii) A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of\nproduction of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toys\nproduced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was\n= 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day.\n\nSolution :\n(i) Let the number of marbles John had be x.\nThen the number of marbles Jivanti had = 45 — x (Why’?).\nThe number of marbles left with John, when he lost 5 marbles = x — 5\nThe number of marbles left with Jivanti, when she lost 5 marbles = 45 — x —5\n= 40-x\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

If we replace x by 1 on the\nLHS of this equation, we get (2 x 1°) — (3 x 1) + 1 = 0 = RHS of the equation.\nWe say that | is a root of the quadratic equation 2x? — 3x + 1 = 0.

We also say that x = a is a solution of\nthe quadratic equation, or that o satisfies the quadratic equation. Note that the\nzeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax’ + bx + c and the roots of the quadratic\nequation ax’ + bx + c= 0 are the same.\n\nYou have observed, in Chapter 2, that a quadratic polynomial can have at most\ntwo zeroes. So, any quadratic equation can have atmost two roots.\n\nYou have learnt in Class IX, how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting\ntheir middle terms. We shall use this knowledge for finding the roots of a quadratic\nequation. Let us see how.\n\nExample 3 : Find the roots of the equation 2x” — 5x + 3 = 0, by factorisation.\nSolution : Let us first split the middle term — 5x as —2x —3x [because (—2x) x (—3x) =\n6x? = (2x7) x 3].\n\nSo, 2x?-— 5x +3 = 2x? -— 2x—-—3x+3 =2x (x-1)-3@-1) =(Qx-3)a-1)\nNow, 2x? — 5x + 3 = 0 can be rewritten as (2x — 3)(x — 1) = 0.\n\nSo, the values of x for which 2x\" — 5x + 3 = 0 are the same for which (2x — 3)(x — 1) =0,\ni.e., either 2x -3 = 0 orx—1=0.\n\n3\nNow, 2x — 3 = 0 gives x=5 and x— 1=0 gives x= 1.\n3\nSo, X= 5 and x = | are the solutions of the equation.\n\n3\nIn other words, 1 and 5 are the roots of the equation 2x? — 5x +3=0.\n\nVerify that these are the roots of the given equation.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

In some, we find that the\nsucceeding terms are obtained by adding a fixed number, in other by multiplying\nwith a fixed number, in another we find that they are squares of consecutive\nnumbers, and so on.\n\nIn this chapter, we shall discuss one of these patterns in which succeeding terms\nare obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding terms. We shall also see how\nto find their nth terms and the sum of 1 consecutive terms, and use this knowledge in\nsolving some daily life problems.\n\n5.2 Arithmetic Progressions\nConsider the following lists of numbers :\n(i) 1, 2, 3, 4,...\n(ii) 100, 70, 40, 10,...\nGi) —3, -2, -1, 0,...\n(iv) 3, 3, 3, 3,...\n(v) —1.0, -1.5, —2.0, -2.5,...\n\nEach of the numbers in the list is called a term.\n\nGiven a term, can you write the next term in each of the lists above? If so, how\nwill you write it? Perhaps by following a pattern or rule. Let us observe and write the\ntule.\n\nIn (1), each term is 1 more than the term preceding it.\n\nIn (11), each term is 30 less than the term preceding it.\nIn (iii), each term is obtained by adding | to the term preceding it.\n\nIn (iv), all the terms in the list are 3 , i.e., each term is obtained by adding\n(or subtracting) 0 to the term preceding it.\n\nIn (v), each term is obtained by adding — 0.5 to (i.e., subtracting 0.5 from) the\nterm preceding it.\n\nIn all the lists above, we see that successive terms are obtained by adding a fixed\nnumber to the preceding terms. Such list of numbers is said to form an Arithmetic\nProgression ( AP ).\n\nSo, an arithmetic progression is a list of numbers in which each term is\nobtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding term except the first\nterm.\n\nThis fixed number is called the common difference of the AP. Remember that\nit can be positive, negative or zero.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n52 MATHEMATICS\n\nLet us denote the first term of an AP by a,, second term by a,,.. ., nth term by\na, and the common difference by d. Then the AP becomes d,, d,, @,,.. ., d,.\n\nn\n\n0, @,—- 2, -a,—-t,—...=a,—a,_, =a.\nSome more examples of AP are:\n(a) The heights ( in cm ) of some students of a school standing in a queue in the\nmorning assembly are 147 , 148, 149, ..., 157.\n(b) The minimum temperatures ( in degree celsius ) recorded for a week in the\nmonth of January in a city, arranged in ascending order are\n3.1, — 3.0, — 2.9, — 2.8, — 2.7, — 2.6, — 2.5\n(c) The balance money ( in & ) after paying 5 % of the total loan of = 1000 every\nmonth is 950, 900, 850, 800, ..., 50.\n(d) The cash prizes ( in = ) given by a school to the toppers of Classes I to XII are,\nrespectively, 200, 250, 300, 350, ..., 750.\n(e) The total savings (in %) after every month for 10 months when = 50 are saved\neach month are 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500.\n\nIt is left as an exercise for you to explain why each of the lists above is an AP.\n\nYou can see that\na,a+d,at2d,a+3d,...\n\nrepresents an arithmetic progression where a is the first term and d the common\ndifference. This is called the general form of an AP.\n\nNote that in examples (a) to (e) above, there are only a finite number of terms.\nSuch an AP is called a finite AP. Also note that each of these Arithmetic Progressions\n(APs) has a last term. The APs in examples (1) to (v) in this section, are not finite APs\nand so they are called infinite Arithmetic Progressions. Such APs do not have a\nlast term.\n\nNow, to know about an AP, what is the minimum information that you need? Is it\nenough to know the first term? Or, is it enough to know only the common difference?\nYou will find that you will need to know both — the first term a and the common\ndifference d.\n\nFor instance if the first term a is 6 and the common difference d is 3, then\nthe AP is\n6, 9,12, 15,...\n\nand if a is 6 and d is — 3, then the AP is\n6, 3, 0,-3,...\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 53\n\nSimilarly, when\na=-7, d=-2, theAPis —7,—9,-11,-13,...\na= 1.0, d=0.1, the APis 1.0, 1.1, 1.2,1.3,...\n\n1 1\na= 0, d=1—, theAPis 0, 15,3,45,6.-..\n\na=2, d=0, fhe APY. 2,.2,.2, 25 00x\nSo, if you know what a and d are, you can list the AP. What about the other way\nround? That is, if you are given a list of numbers can you say that it is an AP and then\nfind a and d? Since ais the first term, it can easily be written. We know that in an AP,\nevery succeeding term is obtained by adding d to the preceding term. So, d found by\nsubtracting any term from its succeeding term, i.e., the term which immediately follows\nit should be same for an AP.\nFor example, for the list of numbers :\n6,9, 12, 15,...,\nWe have a,—a, QS 6>3,\na, —@, = 129 =3,\na, Ome — 12\nHere the difference of any two consecutive terms in each case is 3.

By looking at it, you can tell that the\ndifference between any two consecutive terms is not the same. So, this is not an AP.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n54 MATHEMATICS\n\nNote that to find din the AP: 6, 3, 0, —3,..., we have subtracted 6 from 3\nand not 3 from 6, i.e., we should subtract the Ath term from the (k + 1) th term\neven if the (k + 1) th term is smaller.\n\nLet us make the concept more clear through some examples.\n\nExample 1 : For the AP: : ; - — 7 = : ,..., write the first term a and the\ncommon difference d.\nSoluti H ; . 3\n\nolution : Here, a= >, a)\n\nRemember that we can find d using any two consecutive terms, once we know that\nthe numbers are in AP.\n\nExample 2 : Which of the following list of numbers form an AP?

How much\nmoney will be collected in the money\nbox by the time her daughter is 21\nyears old?\n\nHere, the amount of money (in ®) put in the money box on her first, second, third,\nfourth .. . birthday were respectively 100, 150, 200, 250, . . . till her 21st birthday. To\nfind the total amount in the money box on her 21st birthday, we will have to write each\nof the 21 numbers in the list above and then add them up. Don’t you think it would be\na tedious and time consuming process? Can we make the process shorter? This would\nbe possible if we can find a method for getting this sum. Let us see.\n\nWe consider the problem given to Gauss (about whom you read in\nChapter 1), to solve when he was just 10 years old. He was asked to find the sum of\nthe positive integers from 1 to 100. He immediately replied that the sum is 5050. Can\nyou guess how did he do? He wrote :\n\nS=1+2+3+...+99+ 100\nAnd then, reversed the numbers to write\nS= 100+99+...+34+2+1\nAdding these two, he got\n28 = (100+ 1) +(99 +2) +...+( +98) + (2 +99) + (1 + 100)\n= 101+ 101+...+101+101 (100 times)\nSo, S= RAAT = 5050 i. the sum = 5050.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n64 MATHEMATICS\n\nWe will now use the same technique to find the sum of the first n terms of an AP:\na,at+d,a+2d,...\n\nThe nth term of this AP is a+ (n — 1) d. Let S denote the sum of the first terms\nof the AP. We have\n\nS=at+(a+d)+(a+2d)+...+[a+(n-1)d] (1)\nRewriting the terms in reverse order, we have\nS=[a+(n—-1)d]+[a+(n—-2)d]+...+(at+d)+a (2)\n\nOn adding (1) and (2), term-wise. we get\n\n5- [2a+ (n— ld] +[2a+ (n-1)d]+...+[2a+ (n —-1)d] +[2a+ (n —-1)d]\n\nn times\n\no, 2S=n[2a+(n-1)d] (Since, there are n terms)\n\n« 8 5 at+(m—1)d]\n\nSo, the sum of the first ” terms of an AP is given by\n\nn\nS= 2 [2a + (n — 1) d]\nWe can also write this as S= 5 lata+(n-1)d|\nn\nLe., S= 5 ata) (3)\n\nNow, if there are only 7 terms in an AP, then a, = /, the last term.\nFrom (3), we see that\n\nS=— (il 4\n=F td (4)\n\nThis form of the result is useful when the first and the last terms of an AP are\ngiven and the common difference is not given.\n\nNow we return to the question that was posed to us in the beginning. The amount\nof money (in Rs) in the money box of Shakila’s daughter on Ist, 2nd, 3rd, 4th birthday,\n..., were 100, 150, 200, 250, .. ., respectively.\n\nThis is an AP. We have to find the total money collected on her 21st birthday, i.e.,\nthe sum of the first 21 terms of this AP.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 65\nHere, a= 100, d=50 and n=21. Using the formula :\n\nS= 5 [atin],\n21 21\nwe have S= y [2100 + 21-1) x50] = [200 + 1000]\n\n= ox 1200 = 12600\n\nSo, the amount of money collected on her 21st birthday is = 12600.\nHasn’t the use of the formula made it much easier to solve the problem?\n\nWe also use S, in place of S to denote the sum of first n terms of the AP. We\nwrite S,, to denote the sum of the first 20 terms of an AP. The formula for the sum of\nthe first n terms involves four quantities S, a, d and n. If we know any three of them,\nwe can find the fourth.\n\nRemark : The rth term of an AP is the difference of the sum to first m terms and the\nsum to first (n — 1) terms of it,ie.,a=-S =S__..\n\nLet us consider some examples.\n\nExample 11 : Find the sum of the first 22 terms of the AP: 8, 3,—2,...\nSolution : Here, a = 8, d=3 —-8 5, n=22.\n\nWe know that\n\nS = 5 atin Na]\n\n2A\nTherefore, S5€ [16 + 21 (-5)] = 11(16 — 105) = 11(-89) =—979\nSo, the sum of the first 22 terms of the AP is — 979.\n\nExample 12 : If the sum of the first 14 terms of an AP is 1050 and its first term is 10,\nfind the 20th term.\n\nSolution : Here, S,,= 1050, n= 14, a= 10.\nn\nAs S = 5 l2a+(n—Da],\n\n[20+13d] = 140 + 91d\n\n1050= i“\nSO, — 5\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n66 MATHEMATICS\nLe., 910= 91d\n\nOr, d= 10\nTherefore, a 10 + (20-1) x 10 = 200, i.e. 20th term is 200.\n\n20\n\nExample 13 : How many terms of the AP: 24, 21, 18, .. . must be taken so that their\nsum is 78?\n\nSolution : Here, a = 24, d=21—24=-3, S = 78. We need to find n.\n\nn\nWe know that S= 5 [24+ (n—-Dd]\nnN n\nSo, 78 = al48 + 1(-3)] = 5|51 3n]\nor 3n?—51n+ 156= 0\nor n—17n+52=0\nor (n— 4)(n — 13) = 0\nor n=4 or 13\n\nBoth values of 7 are admissible. So, the number of terms is either 4 or 13.\nRemarks:\n\n1. In this case, the sum of the first 4 terms = the sum of the first 13 terms = 78.\n\n2. Two answers are possible because the sum of the terms from Sth to 13th will be\nzero. This is because a is positive and d is negative, so that some terms will be\npositive and some others negative, and will cancel out each other.\n\nExample 14 : Find the sum of :\n(i) the first 1000 positive integers (ii) the first 7 positive integers\nSolution :\n\nG) LetS = 1 FQ 3 +...+ 1000\n\nn\nUsing the formula S| = 3A +1) for the sum of the first n terms of an AP, we\n\nhave\n\n1000\n= (1 + 1000) = 500 x 1001 = 500500\n\n1000\nSo, the sum of the first 1000 positive integers is 500500.\n(i) LetS =1+2+3+...+n\n\nHere a = | and the last term / is n.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 67\n\nn(1+n) n(a+l)\nTherefore, S,= a or S = a\n\nSo, the sum of first 1 positive integers is given by\n\nn(n + 1)\n2\nExample 15 : Find the sum of first 24 terms of the list of numbers whose nth term is\ngiven by\na,=3+2n\nSolution :\nAs w= Ae Dn,\nso, a= 342=35\nu,= Iranlay\na,=3+2xp=y\n\nList of numbers becomes 5, 7,9, 11,...\n\nHere, 7-5=9-—7=11-—9=2 and so on.\nSo, it forms an AP with common difference d= 2.\n\nTo find S,,, we haven=24, a=5, d=2.\n\n24?\n\n24\nTherefore, S,, = oy XS + 24-D xl = 12[10+ 46] = 672\n\n24\nSo, sum of first 24 terms of the list of numbers is 672.\n\nExample 16 : A manufacturer of TV sets produced 600 sets in the third year and 700\nsets in the seventh year.

The APs in examples (1) to (v) in this section, are not finite APs\nand so they are called infinite Arithmetic Progressions. Such APs do not have a\nlast term.\n\nNow, to know about an AP, what is the minimum information that you need? Is it\nenough to know the first term? Or, is it enough to know only the common difference?\nYou will find that you will need to know both — the first term a and the common\ndifference d.\n\nFor instance if the first term a is 6 and the common difference d is 3, then\nthe AP is\n6, 9,12, 15,...\n\nand if a is 6 and d is — 3, then the AP is\n6, 3, 0,-3,...\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

Recall that two figures\nare said to be congruent, if they have the same shape and the same size. In this\nchapter, we shall study about those figures which have the same shape but not necessarily\nthe same size. Two figures having the same shape (and not necessarily the same size)\nare called similar figures. In particular, we shall discuss the similarity of triangles and\napply this knowledge in giving a simple proof of Pythagoras Theorem learnt earlier.\n\nCan you guess how heights of mountains (say Mount Everest) or distances of\nsome long distant objects (say moon) have been found out? Do you think these have\n\nWAH! WAH!\nAAH! Soon T will\nIt is so easy reach the moon.\nto measure the\nheight of the\nmountain.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n74 MATHEMATICS\n\nbeen measured directly with the help of a measuring tape? In fact, all these heights\nand distances have been found out using the idea of indirect measurements, which is\nbased on the principle of similarity of figures (see Example 7, Q.15 of Exercise 6.3\nand also Chapters 8 and 9 of this book).\n\n6.2 Similar Figures\n\nIn Class IX, you have seen that all circles with the same radii are congruent, all\nsquares with the same side lengths are congruent and all equilateral triangles with the\n\nsame side lengths are congruent.\nNow consider any two (or more)\ncircles [see Fig. 6.1 (i)]. Are they\ncongruent? Since all of them do not\nhave the same radius, they are not\n(i)\n\ncongruent to each other. Note that\nsome are congruent and some are not,\n\nbut all of them have the same shape.\nSo they all are, what we call, similar.\nTwo similar figures have the same\nshape but not necessarily the same\nsize. Therefore, all circles are similar. | |\nWhat about two (or more) squares or\n\ntwo (or more) equilateral triangles (ii)\n[see Fig. 6.1 (ii) and (i1i)]? As observed\nin the case of circles, here also all\n\nsquares are similar and all equilateral\ntriangles are similar. P\nFrom the above, we can say\n\nthat all congruent figures are (iii)\nsimilar but the similar figures need\nnot be congruent. Fig. 6.1\n\nCan a circle and a square be\n\n¥ S\nsimilar? Can a triangle and a square + F\nbe similar? These questions can be\nanswered by just looking at the\nfigures (see Fig. 6.1). Evidently  B c Q\nR\n\nthese figures are not similar. (Why?)\nFig. 6.2\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nTRIANGLES Wis\n\nWhat can you say about the two quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS\n(see Fig 6.2)?Are they similar? These figures appear to be similar but we cannot be\ncertain about it. Therefore, we must have some definition of similarity of figures and\nbased on this definition some rules to decide whether the two given figures are similar\nor not. For this, let us look at the photographs given in Fig. 6.3:\n\nFig. 6.3\n\nYou will at once say that they are the photographs of the same monument\n(Taj Mahal) but are in different sizes. Would you say that the three photographs are\nsimilar? Yes,they are.\n\nWhat can you say about the two photographs of the same size of the same\nperson one at the age of 10 years and the other at the age of 40 years? Are these\nphotographs similar? These photographs are of the same size but certainly they are\nnot of the same shape. So, they are not similar.\n\nWhat does the photographer do when she prints photographs of different sizes\nfrom the same negative? You must have heard about the stamp size, passport size and\npostcard size photographs. She generally takes a photograph on a small size film, say\nof 35mm size and then enlarges it into a bigger size, say 45mm (or 55mm). Thus, if we\nconsider any line segment in the smaller photograph (figure), its corresponding line\n\n45 55\nsegment in the bigger photograph (figure) will be 35 [or 2) of that of the line segment.\n\nThis really means that every line segment of the smaller photograph is enlarged\n(increased) in the ratio 35:45 (or 35:55). It can also be said that every line segment\nof the bigger photograph is reduced (decreased) in the ratio 45:35 (or 55:35). Further,\nif you consider inclinations (or angles) between any pair of corresponding line segments\nin the two photographs of different sizes, you shall see that these inclinations(or angles)\nare always equal. This is the essence of the similarity of two figures and in particular\nof two polygons. We say that:\n\nTwo polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (i) their\ncorresponding angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the\nsame ratio (or proportion).\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n16 MATHEMATICS\n\nNote that the same ratio of the corresponding sides is referred to as the scale\nfactor (or the Representative Fraction) for the polygons. You must have heard that\nworld maps (i.e., global maps) and blue prints for the construction of a building are\nprepared using a suitable scale factor and observing certain conventions.\n\nIn order to understand similarity of figures more clearly, let us perform the following\nactivity:\nActivity 1: Place a lighted bulb at a Oo\npoint O on the ceiling and directly below\nit a table in your classroom. Let us cut a\npolygon, say a quadrilateral ABCD, from\na plane cardboard and place this\ncardboard parallel to the ground between\nthe lighted bulb and the table. Then a\nshadow of ABCD is cast on the table.\nMark the outline of this shadow as\nA’B’C’D’ (see Fig.6.4).\nNote that the quadrilateral A’B’C’D’ is\nan enlargement (or magnification) of the\nquadrilateral ABCD. This is because of\nthe property of light that light propogates\nin a straight line. You may also note that\nA’ lies on ray OA, B’ lies on ray OB, C’\nlies on OC and D’ lies on OD. Thus, quadrilaterals A’B’C’D’ and ABCD are of the\nsame shape but of different sizes.\n\nSo, quadrilateral A’B’C’D’ is similiar to quadrilateral ABCD. We can also say\nthat quadrilateral ABCD is similar to the quadrilateral A’B’C’D’.\n\nHere, you can also note that vertex A’ corresponds to vertex A, vertex B’\ncorresponds to vertex B, vertex C’ corresponds to vertex C and vertex D’ corresponds\nto vertex D.

So, we can state the same conditions\nfor the similarity of two triangles. That is:\n\nTwo triangles are similiar, if\n(i) their corresponding angles are equal and\n(ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).\n\nNote that if corresponding angles of two\ntriangles are equal, then they are known as\nequiangular triangles. A famous Greek\nmathematician Thales gave an important truth relating\nto two equiangular triangles which is as follows:\n\nThe ratio of any two corresponding sides in\ntwo equiangular triangles is always the same.\n\nIt is believed that he had used a result called\nthe Basic Proportionality Theorem (now known as\nthe Thales Theorem) for the same. Thales\n\n(640 — 546 B.C.)\n\nTo understand the Basic Proportionality\nTheorem, let us perform the following activity:\n\nActivity 2 : Draw any angle XAY and on its one\narm AX, mark points (say five points) P, Q, D, Rand\nB such that AP = PQ = QD = DR = RB.\n\nNow, through B, draw any line intersecting arm\nAY at C (see Fig. 6.9).\n\nAlso, through the point D, draw a line parallel\nto BC to intersect AC at E.

Symbolically, we write the similarity of these two triangles as\n‘A ABC ~ A DEF’ and read it as ‘triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF’. The\nsymbol ‘~’ stands for ‘is similar to’. Recall that you have used the symbol ‘=’ for\n“is congruent to’ in Class IX.\n\nNow a natural question arises : For checking the similarity of two triangles, say\nABC and DEF, should we always look for all the equality relations of their corresponding\nangles (ZA=2D, ZB=ZE, Z C= ZF) and all the equality relations of the ratios\n\n. : . AB _ BC _CA .\nof their corresponding sides & ~ oF i ? Let us examine. You may recall that\nin Class IX, you have obtained some criteria for congruency of two triangles involving\nonly three pairs of corresponding parts (or elements) of the two triangles. Here also,\nlet us make an attempt to arrive at certain criteria for similarity of two triangles involving\nrelationship between less number of pairs of corresponding parts of the two triangles,\ninstead of all the six pairs of corresponding parts. For this, let us perform the following\nactivity:\n\nActivity 4 : Draw two line segments BC and EF of two different lengths, say 3 cm\nand 5 cm respectively. Then, at the points B and C respectively, construct angles PBC\nand QCB of some measures, say, 60° and 40°. Also, at the points E and F, construct\nangles REF and SFE of 60° and 40° respectively (see Fig. 6.23).\n\npre 407 ¢\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nTRIANGLES 87\n\nLet rays BP and CQ intersect each other at A and rays ER and FS intersect each\nother at D. In the two triangles ABC and DEF, you can see that\nZB=ZE,2ZC=ZF and Z A= Z D. That is, corresponding angles of these two\ntriangles are equal. What can you say about their corresponding sides ? Note that\nBC 3\n\nAB CA\n= ==06. a“ <9\nEF 5 What about DE and FD. On measuring AB, DE, CA and FD, you\n\n. AB CA ‘ ‘\nwill find that TE and Ep ae also equal to 0.6 (or nearly equal to 0.6, if there is some\nAB_BC_ CA\n\nin th t). Thus, ——- = —— = ——- You can repeat this activity b\nerror in the measurement). Thus, DE EF ED p y by\n\nconstructing several pairs of triangles having their corresponding angles equal. Every\ntime, you will find that their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).\nThis activity leads us to the following criterion for similarity of two triangles.\n\nTheorem 6.3 : If in two triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their\ncorresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion) and hence the two\n\ntriangles are similar. D\nThis criterion is referred to as the AAA\n(Angle—Angle—Angle) criterion of A\nsimilarity of two triangles.\nThis theorem can be proved by taking two P Q\ntriangles ABC and DEF such that F\nZA=ZD,ZB=ZEandZC=ZF. B © E\n(see Fig. 6.24) Fig. 6.24\nCut DP = AB and DQ = AC and join PQ.\nSo, A ABC = A DPQ (Why ?)\nThis gives ZB=ZP =ZE and PQ|| EF (How?)\nheref oO hy?\nTherefore, PE OF (Why?)\n| AB _ AC Why?\n1Le., DE DF (Why?)\nSimilart AB BC d AB _ BC _ AC\nimilarly, De = pp 2480 De = ER pr:\n\nRemark : If two angles of a triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another\ntriangle, then by the angle sum property of a triangle their third angles will also be\nequal. Therefore, AAA similarity criterion can also be stated as follows:\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n88 MATHEMATICS\n\nIf two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another\ntriangle, then the two triangles are similar.\n\nThis may be referred to as the AA similarity criterion for two triangles.\n\nYou have seen above that if the three angles of one triangle are respectively\nequal to the three angles of another triangle, then their corresponding sides are\nproportional (i.e., in the same ratio). What about the converse of this statement? Is the\nconverse true? In other words, if the sides of a triangle are respectively proportional to\nthe sides of another triangle, is it true that their corresponding angles are equal? Let us\nexamine it through an activity :\n\nActivity 5 : Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB = 3 cm, BC = 6 cm,\nCA = 8 cm, DE = 4.5 cm, EF = 9 cm and FD = 12 cm (see Fig. 6.25).\n\nD\nA\n8 cm 4.5 cm LNG\n3cm\nB 6cm C E 9cm F\nFig. 6.25\n. h AB _ BC _ CA h It 2\no, you have : DE EF FD (each equal to 3 )\n\nNow measure Z A, ZB, Z C, Z D, Z E and Z F. You will observe that\nZA=Z2D,2ZB=2ZEand 7C=Z F,iie., the corresponding angles of the two\ntriangles are equal.\n\nYou can repeat this activity by drawing several such triangles (having their sides\nin the same ratio). Everytime you shall see that their corresponding angles are equal.\nItis due to the following criterion of similarity of two triangles:\n\nTheorem 6.4 : [f in two triangles, sides of one triangle are proportional to\n(i.e., in the same ratio of ) the sides of the other triangle, then their corresponding\nangles are equal and hence the two triangles are similiar.\n\nThis criterion is referred to as the SSS (Side—Side—Side) similarity criterion for\ntwo triangles.\n\nThis theorem can be proved by taking two triangles ABC and DEF such that\nAB_ BC _CA\nDE EF FD\n\n(< 1) (See Fig. 6.26):\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nTRIANGLES 89\n\nD\nA\nP Q\nB C E F\nFig. 6.26\nCut DP = AB and DQ = AC and join PQ.\nIt b that pr = a d P EF (How?\ncan be seen tha PE OF and PQ || (How?)\nSo, ZP=ZE and ZQ=ZF.\nDP DQ PQ\nTherefore, DE DF EF\nr DP DQ BC ah?\n“4 DE DF. EF ‘Why”)\nSo, BC= PQ (Why?)\nThus, A ABC = A DPQ (Why ?)\nSo, ZA=ZD, ZB=ZE and ZC=ZF (How?)\n\nRemark : You may recall that either of the two conditions namely, (1) corresponding\nangles are equal and (11) corresponding sides are in the same ratio is not sufficient for\ntwo polygons to be similar. However, on the basis of Theorems 6.3 and 6.4, you can\nnow Say that in case of similarity of the two triangles, it is not necessary to check both\nthe conditions as one condition implies the other.\n\nLet us now recall the various criteria for congruency of two triangles learnt in\nClass IX. You may observe that SSS similarity criterion can be compared with the SSS\ncongruency criterion. This suggests us to look for a similarity criterion comparable to\nSAS congruency criterion of triangles. For this, let us perform an activity.\n\nActivity 6 : Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB = 2 cm, Z A = 50°,\nAC =4cm, DE=3 cm, Z D=50° and DF = 6 cm (see Fig.6.27).\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n90 MATHEMATICS\n\nA\n\\>\n4cm 6 cm\n2 cm 3 cm\nB Cc E E\nFig. 6.27\nAC\n\n2\nHere, you may observe that (each equal to 3) and Z A (included\n\nDE DF\nbetween the sides AB and AC) = Z D (included between the sides DE and DF). That\nis, one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and sides including\nthese angles are in the same ratio (i.e., proportion). Now let us measure Z B, Z C,\nZEand ZF.\n\nYou will find that Z B= Z Eand Z C= ZF. Thatis, ZA= 2D, Z B= Z Eand\nZC=ZE. So, by AAA similarity criterion, A ABC ~ A DEF. You may repeat this\nactivity by drawing several pairs of such triangles with one angle of a triangle equal to\none angle of another triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional.\nEverytime, you will find that the triangles are similar. It is due to the following criterion\nof similarity of triangles:\n\nTheorem 6.5 : If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of the other\ntriangle and the sides including these angles are proportional, then the two\ntriangles are similar.\nThis criterion is referred to as\nthe SAS (Side—Angle—Side)\nsimilarity criterion for two\ntriangles. A\nAs before, this theorem can\nbe proved by taking two triangles\nABC and DEF = such that\n\nAB_ AC 7 B C E F\nDE. DF (< l)and ZA=ZD\n\n(see Fig. 6.28).

Recall that two figures\nare said to be congruent, if they have the same shape and the same size. In this\nchapter, we shall study about those figures which have the same shape but not necessarily\nthe same size. Two figures having the same shape (and not necessarily the same size)\nare called similar figures. In particular, we shall discuss the similarity of triangles and\napply this knowledge in giving a simple proof of Pythagoras Theorem learnt earlier.\n\nCan you guess how heights of mountains (say Mount Everest) or distances of\nsome long distant objects (say moon) have been found out?

In fact, all these heights\nand distances have been found out using the idea of indirect measurements, which is\nbased on the principle of similarity of figures (see Example 7, Q.15 of Exercise 6.3\nand also Chapters 8 and 9 of this book).\n\n6.2 Similar Figures\n\nIn Class IX, you have seen that all circles with the same radii are congruent, all\nsquares with the same side lengths are congruent and all equilateral triangles with the\n\nsame side lengths are congruent.\nNow consider any two (or more)\ncircles [see Fig. 6.1 (i)]. Are they\ncongruent? Since all of them do not\nhave the same radius, they are not\n(i)\n\ncongruent to each other. Note that\nsome are congruent and some are not,\n\nbut all of them have the same shape.\nSo they all are, what we call, similar.\nTwo similar figures have the same\nshape but not necessarily the same\nsize. Therefore, all circles are similar. | |\nWhat about two (or more) squares or\n\ntwo (or more) equilateral triangles (ii)\n[see Fig. 6.1 (ii) and (i1i)]? As observed\nin the case of circles, here also all\n\nsquares are similar and all equilateral\ntriangles are similar. P\nFrom the above, we can say\n\nthat all congruent figures are (iii)\nsimilar but the similar figures need\nnot be congruent. Fig. 6.1\n\nCan a circle and a square be\n\n¥ S\nsimilar? Can a triangle and a square + F\nbe similar? These questions can be\nanswered by just looking at the\nfigures (see Fig. 6.1). Evidently  B c Q\nR\n\nthese figures are not similar.

        "text": "TRIANGLES Wis\n\nWhat can you say about the two quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS\n(see Fig 6.2)?Are they similar? These figures appear to be similar but we cannot be\ncertain about it. Therefore, we must have some definition of similarity of figures and\nbased on this definition some rules to decide whether the two given figures are similar\nor not. For this, let us look at the photographs given in Fig. 6.3:\n\nFig. 6.3\n\nYou will at once say that they are the photographs of the same monument\n(Taj Mahal) but are in different sizes. Would you say that the three photographs are\nsimilar? Yes,they are.\n\nWhat can you say about the two photographs of the same size of the same\nperson one at the age of 10 years and the other at the age of 40 years? Are these\nphotographs similar? These photographs are of the same size but certainly they are\nnot of the same shape. So, they are not similar.\n\nWhat does the photographer do when she prints photographs of different sizes\nfrom the same negative? You must have heard about the stamp size, passport size and\npostcard size photographs. She generally takes a photograph on a small size film, say\nof 35mm size and then enlarges it into a bigger size, say 45mm (or 55mm). Thus, if we\nconsider any line segment in the smaller photograph (figure), its corresponding line\n\n45 55\nsegment in the bigger photograph (figure) will be 35 [or 2) of that of the line segment.\n\nThis really means that every line segment of the smaller photograph is enlarged\n(increased) in the ratio 35:45 (or 35:55). It can also be said that every line segment\nof the bigger photograph is reduced (decreased) in the ratio 45:35 (or 55:35). Further,\nif you consider inclinations (or angles) between any pair of corresponding line segments\nin the two photographs of different sizes, you shall see that these inclinations(or angles)\nare always equal. This is the essence of the similarity of two figures and in particular\nof two polygons. We say that:\n\nTwo polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (i) their\ncorresponding angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the\nsame ratio (or proportion).\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

You must have heard that\nworld maps (i.e., global maps) and blue prints for the construction of a building are\nprepared using a suitable scale factor and observing certain conventions.\n\nIn order to understand similarity of figures more clearly, let us perform the following\nactivity:\nActivity 1: Place a lighted bulb at a Oo\npoint O on the ceiling and directly below\nit a table in your classroom. Let us cut a\npolygon, say a quadrilateral ABCD, from\na plane cardboard and place this\ncardboard parallel to the ground between\nthe lighted bulb and the table. Then a\nshadow of ABCD is cast on the table.\nMark the outline of this shadow as\nA’B’C’D’ (see Fig.6.4).\nNote that the quadrilateral A’B’C’D’ is\nan enlargement (or magnification) of the\nquadrilateral ABCD. This is because of\nthe property of light that light propogates\nin a straight line. You may also note that\nA’ lies on ray OA, B’ lies on ray OB, C’\nlies on OC and D’ lies on OD. Thus, quadrilaterals A’B’C’D’ and ABCD are of the\nsame shape but of different sizes.\n\nSo, quadrilateral A’B’C’D’ is similiar to quadrilateral ABCD. We can also say\nthat quadrilateral ABCD is similar to the quadrilateral A’B’C’D’.\n\nHere, you can also note that vertex A’ corresponds to vertex A, vertex B’\ncorresponds to vertex B, vertex C’ corresponds to vertex C and vertex D’ corresponds\nto vertex D. Symbolically, these correspondences are represented as A’ <> A, B’ <> B,\nC’ © C and D’ © D.

AB _ BC _ CD __ DA\n\n) Vp BC CD DAY\n\nThis again emphasises that two polygons of the same number of sides are\n\nsimilar, if (i) all the corresponding angles are equal and (ii) all the corresponding\nsides are in the same ratio (or proportion).\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

The distance of a point from the y-axis is called its\nx-coordinate, or abscissa. The distance of a point from the x-axis is called its\ny-coordinate, or ordinate. The coordinates of a point on the x-axis are of the form\n(x, 0), and of a point on the y-axis are of the form (0, y).\n\nHere is a play for you. Draw a set of a pair of perpendicular axes on a graph\npaper. Now plot the following points and join them as directed: Join the point A(4, 8) to\nB(3, 9) to C(3, 8) to DI, 6) to EC, 5) to F(3, 3) to G(6, 3) to H(8, 5) to I(8, 6) to\nJ(6, 8) to K(6, 9) to L(5, 8) to A. Then join the points P(3.5, 7), Q (3, 6) and R(4, 6) to\nform a triangle. Also join the points X(5.5, 7), Y(5, 6) and Z(6, 6) to form a triangle.\nNow join S(4, 5), T(4.5, 4) and U(5, 5) to form a triangle. Lastly join S to the points\n(0, 5) and (0, 6) and join U to the points (9, 5) and (9, 6). What picture have you got?\n\nAlso, you have seen that a linear equation in two variables of the form\nax + by +c = 0, (a, 6 are not simultaneously zero), when represented graphically,\ngives a straight line. Further, in Chapter 2, you have seen the graph of\ny=ax’ + bx +c (a#0), is a parabola. In fact, coordinate geometry has been developed\nas an algebraic tool for studying geometry of figures. It helps us to study geometry\nusing algebra, and understand algebra with the help of geometry. Because of this,\ncoordinate geometry is widely applied in various fields such as physics, engineering,\nnavigation, seismology and art!\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn how to find the distance between the two points\nwhose coordinates are given. You will also study how to find the coordinates of the\npoint which divides a line segment joining two given points in a given ratio.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n100\n\n7.2 Distance Formula\nLet us consider the following situation:\n\nA town B is located 36 km east and 15\nkm north of the town A. How would you find\nthe distance from town A to town B without\nactually measuring it. Let us see. This situation\ncan be represented graphically as shown in\nFig. 7.1. You may use the Pythagoras Theorem\nto calculate this distance.\n\nNow, suppose two points lie on the x-axis.\nCan we find the distance between them? For\ninstance, consider two points A(4, 0) and B(6, 0)\nin Fig. 7.2. The points A and B lie on the x-axis.\n\nFrom the figure you can see that OA = 4\nunits and OB = 6 units.\n\nTherefore, the distance of B from A, ie.,\nAB = OB- OA = 6-4 =2 units.\n\nSo, if two points lie on the x-axis, we can\neasily find the distance between them.\n\nNow, suppose we take two points lying on\nthe y-axis. Can you find the distance between\nthem. If the points C(0, 3) and D(0, 8) lie on the\ny-axis, similarly we find that CD = 8 —3 =5 units\n(see Fig. 7.2).\n\nMATHEMATICS\n\nNorth\n\nB x\n1 2 374 5 6\n(4,0) Noo\n\nFig. 7.2\n\nNext, can you find the distance of A from C (in Fig. 7.2)? Since OA = 4 units and\nOC = 3 units, the distance of A from C, i.e., AC = ./3° + 4° =5 units. Similarly, you can\n\nfind the distance of B from D = BD = 10 units.\n\nNow, if we consider two points not lying on coordinate axis, can we find the\ndistance between them? Yes! We shall use Pythagoras theorem to do so. Let us see\n\nan example.\n\nIn Fig. 7.3, the points P(4, 6) and Q(6, 8) lie in the first quadrant.

Then join the points P(3.5, 7), Q (3, 6) and R(4, 6) to\nform a triangle. Also join the points X(5.5, 7), Y(5, 6) and Z(6, 6) to form a triangle.\nNow join S(4, 5), T(4.5, 4) and U(5, 5) to form a triangle.

Herbart (1890)\n8.1 Introduction\n\nYou have already studied about triangles, and in particular, right triangles, in your\nearlier classes. Let us take some examples from our surroundings where right triangles\ncan be imagined to be formed. For instance :\n1. Suppose the students of a school are\nvisiting Qutub Minar. Now, if a student\nis looking at the top of the Minar, a right\ntriangle can be imagined to be made,\nas shown in Fig 8.1. Can the student\nfind out the height of the Minar, without\nactually measuring it?\n\n2. Suppose a girl is sitting on the balcony\nof her house located on the bank of a Fig. 8.1\nriver. She is looking down at a flower\npot placed onastairofatemple situated\n\nnearby on the other bank of the river. __. a\nA right triangle is imagined to be made Acs f~. a, A\nin this situation as shown in Fig.8.2. If “a,\n\nyou know the height at which the ©\nperson is sitting, can you find the width\n\nof the river?\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n114 MATHEMATICS\n\n3. Suppose a hot air balloon is flying in\nthe air. A girl happens to spot the\nballoon in the sky and runs to her @, @)\nmother to tell her about it. Her mother A ain\nrushes out of the house to look at the\nballoon.Now when the girl had spotted\nthe balloon intially it was at point A.\nWhen both the mother and daughter La :\ncame out to see it, it had already _Af*-----~- See i a?\ntravelled to another point B. Can you ;\nfind the altitude of B from the ground? Fig. 8.3\n\nIn all the situations given above, the distances or heights can be found by using\nsome mathematical techniques, which come under a branch of mathematics called\n‘trigonometry’. The word ‘trigonometry’ is derived from the Greek words ‘tri’\n(meaning three), ‘gon’ (meaning sides) and ‘metron’ (meaning measure). In fact,\ntrigonometry is the study of relationships between the sides and angles of a triangle.\nThe earliest known work on trigonometry was recorded in Egypt and Babylon. Early\nastronomers used it to find out the distances of the stars and planets from the Earth.\nEven today, most of the technologically advanced methods used in Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences are based on trigonometrical concepts.\n\nIn this chapter, we will study some ratios of the sides of a right triangle with\nrespect to its acute angles, called trigonometric ratios of the angle. We will restrict\nour discussion to acute angles only. However, these ratios can be extended to other\nangles also. We will also define the trigonometric ratios for angles of measure 0° and\n90°. We will calculate trigonometric ratios for some specific angles and establish\nsome identities involving these ratios, called trigonometric identities.\n\n8.2 Trigonometric Ratios\n\nC\n\nIn Section 8.1, you have seen some right triangles <\nimagined to be formed in different situations. =\ns\n\nLet us take a right triangle ABC as shown s\n\nx at Hypotenuse ms\nin Fig. 8.4. =\nHere, Z CAB (or, in brief, angle A) is an 5\nacute angle. Note the position of the side BC 5\nwith respect to angle A. It faces Z A. We call it A 7 =\n\nthe side opposite to angle A. AC is the Side adjacent to\nhypotenuse of the right triangle and the side AB angle A\nis a part of Z A. So, we call it the side\n\nadjacent to angle A. Fig. 8.4\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nINTRODUCTION TO TRIGONOMETRY L15\n\nNote that the position of sides change C\nwhen you consider angle C in place of A .\n(see Fig. 8.5).\n\nYou have studied the concept of ‘ratio’ in H 3\n\n; : . ypotenuse &,\nyour earlier classes. We now define certain ratios ZU\ninvolving the sides of a right triangle, and call i F\nthem trigonometric ratios. as\n\nThe trigonometric ratios of the angle A A B\nin right triangle ABC (see Fig. 8.4) are defined Side opposite to\nas follows : aigle ©\n\n; side opposite to angle A = BC Pleas\nsine of ZA= =\nhypotenuse AC\n\n; side adjacent to angle A AB\n\ncosine of Z A= =\n\nhypotenuse AC\nside opposite toangle A = BC\ntangent of Z A= — ; =\nside adjacent to angle A AB\n1 hypotenuse AG\n\ncosecant of Z A= — =— =\nsine of ZA _ side opposite to angle A BC\n\n1 _ hypotenuse AC\n\nsecant of Z A= —~ = — - =\ncosine of Z A side adjacent to angle A =AB\n\n1 _ side adjacent to angle A — AB\ntangent of Z A side opposite to angle A BC\n\ncotangent of Z A=\n\nThe ratios defined above are abbreviated as sin A, cos A, tan A, cosec A, sec A\nand cot A respectively. Note that the ratios cosec A, sec A and cot A are respectively,\nthe reciprocals of the ratios sin A, cos A and tan A.\n\nBC\nBC ac. sinA cosA\nAlso, observe that tan A = AB = Ae = cos A and cot A= sinA :\nAC\n\nSo, the trigonometric ratios of an acute angle in a right triangle express the\nrelationship between the angle and the length of its sides.\n\nWhy don’t you try to define the trigonometric ratios for angle C in the right\ntriangle? (See Fig. 8.5)\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n116 MATHEMATICS\n\nThe first use of the idea of ‘sine’ in the way we use\nit today was in the work Aryabhatiyam by Aryabhata,\nin A.D. 500. Aryabhata used the word ardha-jya\nfor the half-chord, which was shortened to jya or\njiva in due course. When the Aryabhatiyam was\ntranslated into Arabic, the word jiva was retained as\nit is. The word jiva was translated into sinus, which\nmeans curve, when the Arabic version was translated\ninto Latin. Soon the word sinus, also used as sine,\n\nbecame common in mathematical texts throughout\nEurope. An English Professor of astronomy Edmund\nGunter (1581-1626), first used the abbreviated Aryabhata\n\nnotation ‘sin’. CE. Cp Se\nThe origin of the terms ‘cosine’ and ‘tangent’ was much later. The cosine function\narose from the need to compute the sine of the complementary angle. Aryabhatta\ncalled it kotijya. The name cosinus originated with Edmund Gunter. In 1674, the\nEnglish Mathematician Sir Jonas Moore first used the abbreviated notation ‘cos’.\n\nRemark : Note that the symbol sin A is used as an\n\nabbreviation for ‘the sine of the angle A’. sin A is not\n\nthe product of ‘sin’ and A. ‘sin’ separated from A\n\nhas no meaning. Similarly, cos A is not the product of\n\n‘cos’ and A. Similar interpretations follow for other P\ntrigonometric ratios also.\n\nHO\n\nNow, if we take a point P on the hypotenuse Hypotenuse\nAC or a point Q on AC extended, of the right triangle\nABC and draw PM perpendicular to AB and QN A a.\nperpendicular to AB extended (see Fig. 8.6), how M BN\nwill the trigonometric ratios of Z A in A PAM differ\nfrom those of Z Ain A CAB or from those of Z Ain Fig. 8.6\nA QAN?\n\nTo answer this, first look at these triangles. Is A PAM similar to A CAB? From\nChapter 6, recall the AA similarity criterion. Using the criterion, you will see that the\ntriangles PAM and CAB are similar. Therefore, by the property of similar triangles,\nthe corresponding sides of the triangles are proportional.\n\nAM AP _ MP\nAB AC. BC\n\nSo, we have\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nINTRODUCTION TO TRIGONOMETRY L17\n\nFrom this, we find wee\nrom this, we fin AP\n\n= —=snA,\nAC\nAM _ AB MP BC\n—— =—~ = cos A, —— = —\nAP AC AM AB\nThis shows that the trigonometric ratios of angle A in A PAM not differ from\nthose of angle A in A CAB.\n\nIn the same way, you should check that the value of sin A (and also of other\ntrigonometric ratios) remains the same in A QAN also.\n\nSimilarly, = tan A and so on.\n\nFrom our observations, it is now clear that the values of the trigonometric\nratios of an angle do not vary with the lengths of the sides of the triangle, if\nthe angle remains the same.\n\nNote : For the sake of convenience, we may write sin’A, cos’A, etc., in place of\n(sin A)’, (cos A)’, etc., respectively. But cosec A= (sin A)! # sin! A (it is called sine\ninverse A). sin! A has a different meaning, which will be discussed in higher classes.\nSimilar conventions hold for the other trigonometric ratios as well. Sometimes, the\nGreek letter 0 (theta) is also used to denote an angle.\n\nWe have defined six trigonometric ratios of an acute angle. If we know any one\nof the ratios, can we obtain the other ratios? Let us see.\n\n1 C\nIf in a right triangle ABC, sin A= 3°\n1\nthen this means that AC = 3 , 1.e., the 3h k\nlengths of the sides BC and AC of the triangle\nABC are in the ratio | : 3 (see Fig. 8.7).Soif A B\n\nBC is equal to k, then AC will be 3k, where\nk is any positive number. To determine other\ntrigonometric ratios for the angle A, we need to find the length of the third side\nAB. Do you remember the Pythagoras theorem? Let us use it to determine the\nrequired length AB.\n\nFig. 8.7\n\nAB? = AC? — BC? = (3k) — (k)? = 8 = (2V2 bP\nTherefore, AB= + 2/2 k\n\nSo, we get AB= 2J/2k (Why is AB not —2/2k?)\n\nAB 22k _ 2V2\nAC 3k 3\nSimilarly, you can obtain the other trigonometric ratios of the angle A.\n\nNow, cos A=\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n118 MATHEMATICS\n\nRemark : Since the hypotenuse is the longest side in a right triangle, the value of\nsin A or cos A 1s always less than 1 (or, in particular, equal to 1).\n\nLet us consider some examples.\n\nC\n4\nExample 1 : Given tan A = 3° find the other\ntrigonometric ratios of the angle A.\nSolution : Let us first draw a right A ABC\n. 4k\n(see Fig 8.8).\nN k that tan A = 8 =\now, we know that tanA= 75 = 73.\nTherefore, if BC = 4k, then AB = 34, where k is a A 3k B\npositive number. J\n; Fig. 8.8\nNow, by using the Pythagoras Theorem, we have\nAC? = AB* + BC? = (4k)° + (3h)? = 25k?\nSo, AC = 5k\nNow, we can write all the trigonometric ratios using their definitions.\nak BC 4k _ 4\nANAC Ste %\nnN AB 3k _ 3\nOy APE 5\nTherefe basa cosec A = 32 dsec A= ==.\nersnenss CO\" tan A 4 snA 4° cosA 3\nP\nExample 2: If Z B and Z Q are\nacute angles such that sin B = sin Q, A\nthen prove that Z B= Z Q.\nSolution : Let us consider two right\ntriangles ABC and PQR where\n: _ ai ‘ Cc B R Q\nsin B = sin Q (see Fig. 8.9).\nFig. 8.9\nnpe 2°\nWe have sin B= AB\nF now PR\nan sin Q= PQ\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nINTRODUCTION TO TRIGONOMETRY 119\n\nTh AC _ PR\nen AB PQ\n\nTheref AC _ AB Lk, say ;\nererore, PR — PQ 2 (1)\n\nNow, using Pythagoras theorem,\n\nand QR = ,/PQ* — PR’\n\nBC JAB? = AC? _ Ji?PQ?=k?PR? _ k/PQ?= PR?\n\n_ - =k\nSo, QR ~ (PQ? -PR? — PQ?

Consider an equilateral triangle ABC. Since\n\neach angle in an equilateral triangle is 60°, therefore, 30°\nZA=ZB=ZC=60°.\n\nDraw the perpendicular AD from A to the side BC B {60° Cc\n(see Fig. 8.15). _\n\nNow A ABD = AACD (Why?) Fig. 8.15\nTherefore, BD = DC\n\nand Z BAD = Z CAD (CPCT)\n\nNow observe that:\n\nA ABD is aright triangle, right- angled at D with Z BAD = 30° and Z ABD = 60°\n(see Fig. 8.15).\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nINTRODUCTION TO TRIGONOMETRY 123\n\nAs you know, for finding the trigonometric ratios, we need to know the lengths of the\nsides of the triangle. So, let us suppose that AB = 2a.\n\n1\nThen, BD = a =a\nand AD? = AB? — BD? = (2a) — (a) = 3a’,\nTherefore, AD= ay3\nNow, we have :\nsin 30° = BD c a cos 30° = AD _ V3 _ v3\nAB 2a 2’ AB 2a 2\n,.

As Z A gets smaller and\nsmaller, the length of the side BC decreases.The point C gets\ncloser to point B, and finally when Z A becomes very close a ; B\nto 0°, AC becomes almost the same as AB (see Fig. 8.17).

Also, when Z A is very close to 0°, AC is nearly the\n\nAB\nsame as AB and so the value of cos A= AC is very close to 1.\n\nThis helps us to see how we can define the values of sin A and cos A when\nA= 0°. We define : sin 0° = 0 and cos 0° = 1.\nUsing these, we have :\n\nsin 0 1\ntan 0° = = 0, cot 0° =\ncos 0° tan\n\n0° which is not defined.

As Z A gets larger and larger, 7 C gets\n\nsmaller and smaller. Therefore, as in the case above, the length of the side AB goes on\n\ndecreasing. The point A gets closer to point B. Finally when Z A is very close to 90°,\n\nZ C becomes very close to 0° and the side AC almost coincides with side BC\n(see Fig. 8.18).\n\nCc c Cc Cc\nA B “ — foneees ab\nFig. 8.18\n\nWhen Z C is very close to 0°, Z A is very close to 90°, side AC is nearly the\nsame as side BC, and so sin A is very close to 1.

Let us take some examples from our surroundings where right triangles\ncan be imagined to be formed. For instance :\n1. Suppose the students of a school are\nvisiting Qutub Minar. Now, if a student\nis looking at the top of the Minar, a right\ntriangle can be imagined to be made,\nas shown in Fig 8.1. Can the student\nfind out the height of the Minar, without\nactually measuring it?\n\n2. Suppose a girl is sitting on the balcony\nof her house located on the bank of a Fig. 8.1\nriver.

Can you ;\nfind the altitude of B from the ground? Fig. 8.3\n\nIn all the situations given above, the distances or heights can be found by using\nsome mathematical techniques, which come under a branch of mathematics called\n‘trigonometry’. The word ‘trigonometry’ is derived from the Greek words ‘tri’\n(meaning three), ‘gon’ (meaning sides) and ‘metron’ (meaning measure). In fact,\ntrigonometry is the study of relationships between the sides and angles of a triangle.\nThe earliest known work on trigonometry was recorded in Egypt and Babylon. Early\nastronomers used it to find out the distances of the stars and planets from the Earth.\nEven today, most of the technologically advanced methods used in Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences are based on trigonometrical concepts.\n\nIn this chapter, we will study some ratios of the sides of a right triangle with\nrespect to its acute angles, called trigonometric ratios of the angle. We will restrict\nour discussion to acute angles only. However, these ratios can be extended to other\nangles also. We will also define the trigonometric ratios for angles of measure 0° and\n90°. We will calculate trigonometric ratios for some specific angles and establish\nsome identities involving these ratios, called trigonometric identities.\n\n8.2 Trigonometric Ratios\n\nC\n\nIn Section 8.1, you have seen some right triangles <\nimagined to be formed in different situations. =\ns\n\nLet us take a right triangle ABC as shown s\n\nx at Hypotenuse ms\nin Fig. 8.4. =\nHere, Z CAB (or, in brief, angle A) is an 5\nacute angle. Note the position of the side BC 5\nwith respect to angle A. It faces Z A. We call it A 7 =\n\nthe side opposite to angle A. AC is the Side adjacent to\nhypotenuse of the right triangle and the side AB angle A\nis a part of Z A. So, we call it the side\n\nadjacent to angle A. Fig. 8.4\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

Aryabhata used the word ardha-jya\nfor the half-chord, which was shortened to jya or\njiva in due course. When the Aryabhatiyam was\ntranslated into Arabic, the word jiva was retained as\nit is. The word jiva was translated into sinus, which\nmeans curve, when the Arabic version was translated\ninto Latin. Soon the word sinus, also used as sine,\n\nbecame common in mathematical texts throughout\nEurope. An English Professor of astronomy Edmund\nGunter (1581-1626), first used the abbreviated Aryabhata\n\nnotation ‘sin’. CE. Cp Se\nThe origin of the terms ‘cosine’ and ‘tangent’ was much later. The cosine function\narose from the need to compute the sine of the complementary angle. Aryabhatta\ncalled it kotijya. The name cosinus originated with Edmund Gunter. In 1674, the\nEnglish Mathematician Sir Jonas Moore first used the abbreviated notation ‘cos’.\n\nRemark : Note that the symbol sin A is used as an\n\nabbreviation for ‘the sine of the angle A’. sin A is not\n\nthe product of ‘sin’ and A. ‘sin’ separated from A\n\nhas no meaning. Similarly, cos A is not the product of\n\n‘cos’ and A. Similar interpretations follow for other P\ntrigonometric ratios also.\n\nHO\n\nNow, if we take a point P on the hypotenuse Hypotenuse\nAC or a point Q on AC extended, of the right triangle\nABC and draw PM perpendicular to AB and QN A a.\nperpendicular to AB extended (see Fig. 8.6), how M BN\nwill the trigonometric ratios of Z A in A PAM differ\nfrom those of Z Ain A CAB or from those of Z Ain Fig. 8.6\nA QAN?\n\nTo answer this, first look at these triangles.

In this chapter,\nyou will be studying about some ways in which trigonometry is used in the life around\nyou.\n\nLet us consider Fig. 8.1 of prvious chapter, which is redrawn below in Fig. 9.1.\n\nC\nwo\noe\n.:\nPR a\nVe\nAngle of elevation ;\nNE anne :B\n\nFig. 9.1\n\nIn this figure, the line AC drawn from the eye of the student to the top of the\nminar is called the line of sight. The student is looking at the top of the minar. The\nangle BAC, so formed by the line of sight with the horizontal, is called the angle of\nelevation of the top of the minar from the eye of the student.\n\nThus, the line of sight is the line drawn from the eye of an observer to the point\nin the object viewed by the observer. The angle of elevation of the point viewed is\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n134 MATHEMATICS\n\nthe angle formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the point being viewed is\nabove the horizontal level, i.e., the case when we raise our head to look at the object\n(see Fig. 9.2).\n\nObject\n\nwee b eee e eee eee eee: Horizontal level\n\nel\n\nFig. 9.2\n\nNow, consider the situation given in Fig. 8.2. The girl sitting on the balcony is\nlooking down at a flower pot placed on a stair of the temple. In this case, the line of\nsight is below the horizontal level. The angle so formed by the line of sight with the\nhorizontal is called the angle of depression.\n\nThus, the angle of depression of a point on the object being viewed is the angle\nformed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the point is below the horizontal\nlevel, 1.e., the case when we lower our head to look at the point being viewed\n(see Fig. 9.3).\n\nFig. 9.3\n\nNow, you may identify the lines of sight, and the angles so formed in Fig. 8.3.\nAre they angles of elevation or angles of depression?\n\nLet us refer to Fig. 9.1 again. If you want to find the height CD of the minar\nwithout actually measuring it, what information do you need? You would need to know\nthe following:\n\n(1) the distance DE at which the student is standing from the foot of the minar\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nSOME APPLICATIONS OF TRIGONOMETRY 135\n\n(ii) the angle of elevation, Z BAC, of the top of the minar\n(it) the height AE of the student.\n\nAssuming that the above three conditions are known, how can we determine the\nheight of the minar?\n\nIn the figure, CD =CB + BD. Here, BD = AE, which is the height of the student.\nTo find BC, we will use trigonometric ratios of Z BAC or Z A.\n\nIn A ABC, the side BC is the opposite side in relation to the known Z A. Now,\nwhich of the trigonometric ratios can we use? Which one of them has the two values\nthat we have and the one we need to determine? Our search narrows down to using\neither tan A or cot A, as these ratios involve AB and BC.\n\nBC AB\nTherefore, tan A= AB ° cotA = BC which on solving would give us BC.\n\nBy adding AE to BC, you will get the height of the minar.\nNow let us explain the process, we have just discussed, by solving some problems.\n\nExample 1 : A tower stands vertically on the ground. From a point on the ground,\nwhich is 15 m away from the foot of the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the\ntower is found to be 60°. Find the height of the tower.\n\nSolution : First let us draw a simple diagram to\nrepresent the problem (see Fig. 9.4). Here AB\nrepresents the tower, CB is the distance of the point\nfrom the tower and Z ACB is the angle of elevation.\nWe need to determine the height of the tower, i.e.,\nAB. Also, ACB is a triangle, right- angled at B.\n\nTo solve the problem, we choose the trigonometric\nratio tan 60° (or cot 60°), as the ratio involves AB\nand BC.\n\nN tan 60° = AB\now, an = Bc\nAB\n\n1 V3 = —\n1.€., 15\n\nie., AB= 15y3\n\nHence, the height of the tower is 15/3 m.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n136 MATHEMATICS\n\nExample 2 : An electrician has to repair an\nelectric fault on a pole of height 5 m. She needs =\nto reach a point 1.3m below the top of the pole\nto undertake the repair work (see Fig. 9.5). What\nshould be the length of the ladder that she should\nuse which, when inclined at an angle of 60° to\nthe horizontal, would enable her to reach the\nrequired position? Also, how far from the foot\nof the pole should she place the foot of the\n\nladder?

You have\nalso studied various terms related to a circle like chord, segment, sector, arc etc.\nLet us now examine the different situations that can arise when a circle and a line\nare given in a plane.\n\nSo, let us consider a circle and a line PQ. There can be three possibilities given\nin Fig. 10.1 below:\n\neae\n\n(i) (ii) (iii)\nFig. 10.1\n\nIn Fig. 10.1 (i), the line PQ and the circle have no common point. In this case,\nPQ is called a non-intersecting line with respect to the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (ii), there\nare two common points A and B that the line PQ and the circle have. In this case, we\ncall the line PQ a secant of the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (iii), there is only one point A which\nis common to the line PQ and the circle. In this case, the line is called a tangent to the\ncircle.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nCIRCLES 145\n\nYou might have seen a pulley fitted over a well which is used\nin taking out water from the well. Look at Fig. 10.2. Here the rope\non both sides of the pulley, if considered as a ray, is like a tangent\nto the circle representing the pulley.\n\nIs there any position of the line with respect to the circle\nother than the types given above? You can see that there cannot\nbe any other type of position of the line with respect to the circle.\nIn this chapter, we will study about the existence of the tangents\nto a circle and also study some of their properties.\n\n10.2 Tangent to a Circle\n\nIn the previous section, you have seen that a tangent* to a circle is a line that\nintersects the circle at only one point.\n\nTo understand the existence of the tangent to a circle at a point, let us perform\nthe following activities:\n\nActivity 1 : Take a circular wire and attach a straight wire AB at a point P of the\ncircular wire so that it can rotate about the point P ina plane. Put the system on a table\nand gently rotate the wire AB about the point P to get different positions of the straight\nwire [see Fig. 10.3(i)].\n\nIn various positions, the wire intersects the\ncircular wire at P and at another point Q, or Q, or\nQ,, etc. In one position, you will see that it will\nintersect the circle at the point P only (see position\nA’B’ of AB). This shows that a tangent exists at\nthe point P of the circle. On rotating further, you\ncan observe that in all other positions of AB, it will\nintersect the circle at P and at another point, say R,\nor R, or R,, etc. So, you can observe that there is\nonly one tangent at a point of the circle. Fig. 10.3 (i)\n\nWhile doing activity above, you must have observed that as the position AB\nmoves towards the position A’ B’, the common point, say Q,, of the line AB and the\ncircle gradually comes nearer and nearer to the common point P. Ultimately, it coincides\nwith the point P in the position A’B’ of A”B”. Again note, what happens if ‘AB’ is\nrotated rightwards about P? The common point R, gradually comes nearer and nearer\nto P and ultimately coincides with P. So, what we see is:\n\nThe tangent to a circle is a special case of the secant, when the two end\npoints of its corresponding chord coincide.\n\n*The word ‘tangent’ comes from the Latin word ‘tangere’, which means to touch and was\nintroduced by the Danish mathematician Thomas Fineke in 1583.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n146 MATHEMATICS\n\nActivity 2 : On a paper, draw a circle and a\nsecant PQ of the circle. Draw various lines\nparallel to the secant on both sides of it. You\nwill find that after some steps, the length of p’\nthe chord cut by the lines will gradually\ndecrease, i.e., the two points of intersection of\nthe line and the circle are coming closer and\ncloser [see Fig. 10.3(ii)]. In one case, it\nbecomes zero on one side of the secant and in\nanother case, it becomes zero on the other side\nof the secant. See the positions P’Q’ and P”Q”\nof the secant in Fig. 10.3 (11). These are the\ntangents to the circle parallel to the given secant\nPQ. This also helps you to see that there cannot Fig. 10.3 (ii)\nbe more than two tangents parallel to a given\n\nsecant.\n\nPp”\n\nQ’\n\nThis activity also establishes, what you must have observed, while doing\nActivity 1, namely, a tangent is the secant when both of the end points of the\ncorresponding chord coincide.\n\nThe common point of the tangent and the circle is called the point of contact\n[the point A in Fig. 10.1 (i1i)]and the tangent is said to touch the circle at the\ncommon point.\n\nNow look around you. Have you seen a bicycle\nor a cart moving? Look at its wheels. All the spokes\nof a wheel are along its radii. Now note the position\nof the wheel with respect to its movement on the\nground. Do you see any tangent anywhere?\n(See Fig. 10.4). In fact, the wheel moves along a line\nwhich is a tangent to the circle representing the wheel.\nAlso, notice that in all positions, the radius through\nthe point of contact with the ground appears to be at\nright angles to the tangent (see Fig. 10.4). We shall Fig. 10.4\nnow prove this property of the tangent.\n\nTheorem 10.1 : The tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the\nradius through the point of contact.\n\nProof : We are given a circle with centre O and a tangent XY to the circle at a\npoint P. We need to prove that OP is perpendicular to XY.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nCIRCLES 147\n\nTake a point Q on XY other than P and join OQ (see Fig. 10.5).\n\nSince this happens for every point on the\nline XY except the point P, OP is the\nshortest of all the distances of the point O to the\npoints of XY. So OP is perpendicular to XY.\n(as shown in Theorem A1.7.)\n\nThe point Q must lie outside the circle.\n(Why? Note that if Q lies inside the circle, XY\nwill become a secant and not a tangent to the\ncircle). Therefore, OQ is longer than the radius\nOP of the circle. That is,\n\nOQ > OP.\n\nRemarks\n\n1. By theorem above, we can also conclude that at any point on a circle there can be\none and only one tangent.\n\n2. The line containing the radius through the point of contact is also sometimes called\nthe ‘normal’ to the circle at the point.\n\n10.3\n\nEXERCISE 10.1\n\n. How many tangents can a circle have?\n. Fillin the blanks :\n\n(i) A tangent to a circle intersects it in ______ point (s).\n(ii) A line intersecting a circle in two points is called a\n(iii) A circle can have ____ parallel tangents at the most.\n\n(iv) The common point of a tangent to a circle and the circle is called\n\n. A tangent PQ at a point P of a circle of radius 5 cm meets a line through the centre O at\n\na point Q so that OQ = 12 cm. Length PQ is:\n(A) 12cm (B) 13cm (C) 85cm (D) 119 cm.\n\n. Draw a circle and two lines parallel to a given line such that one is a tangent and the\n\nother, a secant to the circle.\n\nNumber of Tangents from a Point on a Circle\n\nTo get an idea of the number of tangents from a point on a circle, let us perform the\nfollowing activity:\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n148\n\nActivity 3: Draw a circle on a paper. Take a\npoint P inside it. Can you draw a tangent to the\ncircle through this point? You will find that all\nthe lines through this point intersect the circle in\ntwo points. So, it is not possible to draw any\ntangent to a circle through a point inside it\n[see Fig. 10.6 (i)].\n\nNext take a point P on the circle and draw\ntangents through this point. You have already\nobserved that there is only one tangent to the\ncircle at such a point [see Fig. 10.6 (11)].\n\nFinally, take a point P outside the circle and\ntry to draw tangents to the circle from this point.\nWhat do you observe? You will find that you\ncan draw exactly two tangents to the circle\nthrough this point [see Fig. 10.6 (iii)].\n\nWe can summarise these facts as follows:\n\nCase 1 : There is no tangent to a circle passing\nthrough a point lying inside the circle.\n\nCase 2: There is one and only one tangent to a\ncircle passing through a point lying on the circle.\n\nCase 3 : There are exactly two tangents to a\ncircle through a point lying outside the circle.\n\nIn Fig. 10.6 (iii), T,and T, are the points of\ncontact of the tangents PT, and PT,\nrespectively.\n\nThe length of the segment of the tangent\nfrom the external point P and the point of contact\nwith the circle is called the length of the tangent\nfrom the point P to the circle.\n\nMATHEMATICS\n\now\nXN\n\n(i)\n\nT,\n(iii)\nFig. 10.6\n\nNote that in Fig. 10.6 (iii), PT, and PT, are the lengths of the tangents from P to\nthe circle. The lengths PT, and PT, have a common property. Can you find this?\n\nMeasure PT, and PT,. Are these equal? In fact, this is always so. Let us give a proof\n\nof this fact in the following theorem.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nCIRCLES\n\nTheorem 10.2 : The lengths of tangents drawn\nfrom an external point to a circle are equal.\n\nProof : We are given a circle with centre O, a\npoint P lying outside the circle and two tangents\nPQ, PR on the circle from P (see Fig. 10.7). We\nare required to prove that PQ = PR.\n\nFor this, we join OP, OQ and OR. Then\nZ OQP and Z ORP are right angles, because\nthese are angles between the radii and tangents,\nand according to Theorem 10.1 they are right\nangles. Now in right triangles OQP and ORP,\n\nOQ = OR\n\nOP = OP\nTherefore, A OQP = A ORP\nThis gives PQ = PR\n\nRemarks\n\n1. The theorem can also be proved by using the Pythagoras Theorem as follows:\n\nR\n\nFig. 10.7\n\n149\n\n(Radii of the same circle)\n\nPQ? = OP? — OQ? = OP? — OR? = PR? (As OQ = OR)\n\nwhich gives PQ = PR.\n\n(Common)\n(RHS)\n(CPCT)\n\n2. Note also that Z OPQ = Z OPR. Therefore, OP is the angle bisector of Z QPR,\ni.e., the centre lies on the bisector of the angle between the two tangents.\n\nLet us take some examples.\n\nExample 1 : Prove that in two concentric circles,\nthe chord of the larger circle, which touches the\nsmaller circle, is bisected at the point of contact.\n\nSolution : We are given two concentric circles\nC, and C, with centre O and a chord AB of the\nlarger circle C, which touches the smaller circle\nC, at the point P (see Fig. 10.8). We need to prove\nthat AP = BP.\n\nLet us join OP. Then, AB is a tangent to C, at P\nand OP is its radius. Therefore, by Theorem 10.1,\n\nOP L AB\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFig. 10.8\n\n\n150 MATHEMATICS\n\nNow AB 1s a chord of the circle C, and OP | AB. Therefore, OP is the bisector of the\nchord AB, as the perpendicular from the centre bisects the chord,\n\nL€., AP = BP\n\nExample 2 : Two tangents TP and TQ are drawn\nto a circle with centre O from an external point T. i\nProve that Z PTQ =2 Z OPQ.\n\nSolution : We are given a circle with centre O,\n\n. T\nan external point T and two tangents TP and TQ “4\nto the circle, where P, Q are the points of contact\n(see Fig. 10.9). We need to prove that 0\nZ PTQ = 2 Z OPQ Fig. 10.9\n\nLet ZPTQ=0\n\nNow, by Theorem 10.2, TP = TQ. So, TPQ is an isosceles triangle.\n\n1 1\nTherefore, Z TPQ = Z TQP = 2 (180° — 8) = 90° — 5°\nAlso, by Theorem 10.1, Z OPT = 90°\nSo, Z OPQ = Z OPT —- Z TPQ = w0° (90° 50)\n\n1 1\n\n= —09=— /PT\n\n2 Z Q\n\nThis gives Z PTQ= 2 Z OPQ\n\nExample 3 : PQ is a chord of length 8 cm of a\ncircle of radius 5 cm. The tangents at P and Q\nintersect at a point T (see Fig. 10.10). Find the\nlength TP.\n\nSolution : Join OT. Let it intersect PQ at the\npoint R. Then A TPQ is isosceles and TO is the\nangle bisector of Z PTQ. So, OT L PQ\nand therefore, OT bisects PQ which gives\nPR=RQ=4cm.\n\nFig. 10.10\n\nAlso, OR= OP? —PR*? = JS —-4 cm =3cm.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nCIRCLES 131\n\nNow, 2ZTPR+ ZRPO=90° = Z TPR + Z PTR (Why?)\nSo, ZRPO=ZPTR\nTherefore, right triangle TRP is similar to the right triangle PRO by AA similarity.\n\nThis gives TP = RP , 1e., TP = 4 or TP = 20 cm.\nPO RO 5 3 3\nNote : TP can also be found by using the Pythagoras Theorem, as follows:\nLet TP =x and TR=y.

In fact, the wheel moves along a line\nwhich is a tangent to the circle representing the wheel.\nAlso, notice that in all positions, the radius through\nthe point of contact with the ground appears to be at\nright angles to the tangent (see Fig. 10.4).

Recall\nthat the portion (or part) of the circular region enclosed\nby two radii and the corresponding arc is called a\nsector of the circle and the portion (or part) of the\ncircular region enclosed between a chord and the\ncorresponding arc is called a segment of the circle.\nThus, in Fig. 11.1, shaded region OAPB is a sector\nof the circle with centre O. Z AOB is called the\n\nFig. 11.1\n\nangle of the sector. Note that in this figure, unshaded region OAQB is also a sector of\nthe circle. For obvious reasons, OAPB is called the minor sector and\nOAQB is called the major sector. You can also see that angle of the major sector is\n\n360° — Z AOB.\n\nNow, look at Fig. 11.2 in which AB is a chord\nof the circle with centre O. So, shaded region APB is\na segment of the circle. You can also note that\nunshaded region AQB is another segment of the circle\nformed by the chord AB. For obvious reasons, APB\nis called the minor segment and AQB is called the\nmajor segment.\n\nRemark : When we write ‘segment’ and ‘sector’\nwe will mean the ‘minor segment’ and the ‘minor\nsector’ respectively, unless stated otherwise.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nAREAS RELATED TO CIRCLES 155\n\nNow with this knowledge, let us try to find some\nrelations (or formulae) to calculate their areas.\n\nLet OAPB be a sector of a circle with centre\nO and radius r (see Fig. 11.3). Let the degree\nmeasure of Z AOB be 0.\n\nYou know that area of a circle (in fact of a\ncircular region or disc) is 17”.\n\nIna way, we can consider this circular region to A B\nbe a sector forming an angle of 360° (i.e., of degree\nmeasure 360) at the centre O. Now by applying the Fig. 11.3\nUnitary Method, we can arrive at the area of the\nsector OAPB as follows:\n\nWhen degree measure of the angle at the centre is 360, area of the\nsector = mr?\n\nSo, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is 1, area of the\nmr?\n\n360\n\nTherefore, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is 0, area of the\n\nsector =\n\n2\n\ntor: _ 9 .®\nseer 360 360\n\nThus, we obtain the following relation (or formula) for area of a sector of a\ncircle:\n\n9 2\nx Tr\n360\n\nwhere + is the radius of the circle and 0 the angle of the sector in degrees.\n\nArea of the sector of angle 0 =\n\nNow, a natural question arises : Can we find\nthe length of the arc APB corresponding to this\nsector? Yes. Again, by applying the Unitary\nMethod and taking the whole length of the circle\n(of angle 360°) as 2mr, we can obtain the required\n\n0\nlength of th APB as ~~ x 20r.\nength of the arc as 36\n\nA)\n= — x2\nSo, length of an arc of a sector of angle 0 360 x “TY , Fig. 11.4\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n156 MATHEMATICS\n\nNow let us take the case of the area of the\nsegment APB of a circle with centre O and radius r\n(see Fig. 11.4).

Recall\nthat the portion (or part) of the circular region enclosed\nby two radii and the corresponding arc is called a\nsector of the circle and the portion (or part) of the\ncircular region enclosed between a chord and the\ncorresponding arc is called a segment of the circle.\nThus, in Fig. 11.1, shaded region OAPB is a sector\nof the circle with centre O. Z AOB is called the\n\nFig. 11.1\n\nangle of the sector. Note that in this figure, unshaded region OAQB is also a sector of\nthe circle. For obvious reasons, OAPB is called the minor sector and\nOAQB is called the major sector. You can also see that angle of the major sector is\n\n360° — Z AOB.\n\nNow, look at Fig. 11.2 in which AB is a chord\nof the circle with centre O. So, shaded region APB is\na segment of the circle. You can also note that\nunshaded region AQB is another segment of the circle\nformed by the chord AB. For obvious reasons, APB\nis called the minor segment and AQB is called the\nmajor segment.\n\nRemark : When we write ‘segment’ and ‘sector’\nwe will mean the ‘minor segment’ and the ‘minor\nsector’ respectively, unless stated otherwise.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

You have also learnt how to find their surface areas and volumes.\n\n(i) (ii) (iii) (iv)\n\nFig. 12.1\n\nIn our day-to-day life, we come across a number of solids made up of combinations\nof two or more of the basic solids as shown above.\n\nYou must have seen a truck with a\ncontainer fitted on its back (see Fig. 12.2),\ncarrying oil or water from one place to\nanother. Is it in the shape of any of the four\nbasic solids mentioned above? You may\nguess that it is made of a cylinder with two\nhemispheres as its ends.\n\nFig. 12.2\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n162 MATHEMATICS\n\nAgain, you may have seen an object like the\none in Fig. 12.3. Can you name it? A test tube, right! 3\n)\n\nYou would have used one in your science laboratory.\nThis tube is also a combination of a cylinder and a\nhemisphere. Similarly, while travelling, you may have\nseen some big and beautiful buildings or monuments\nmade up of a combination of solids mentioned above.\n\nIf for some reason you wanted to find the\nsurface areas, or volumes, or capacities of such\nobjects, how would you do it? We cannot classify\n\nthese under any of the solids you have already studied. Fig. 12.3\n\nIn this chapter, you will see how to find surface areas and volumes of such\nobjects.\n\n12.2 Surface Area of a Combination of Solids\n\nLet us consider the container seen in Fig. 12.2. How do we find the surface area of\nsuch a solid? Now, whenever we come across a new problem, we first try to see, if\nwe can break it down into smaller problems, we have earlier solved. We can see that\nthis solid is made up of a cylinder with two hemispheres stuck at either end. It would\nlook like what we have in Fig. 12.4, after we put the pieces all together.\n\n(Gil )\n\nFig. 12.4\nIf we consider the surface of the newly formed object, we would be able to see\nonly the curved surfaces of the two hemispheres and the curved surface of the cylinder.\n\nSo, the total surface area of the new solid is the sum of the curved surface\nareas of each of the individual parts. This gives,\n\nTSA of new solid = CSA of one hemisphere + CSA of cylinder\n+ CSA of other hemisphere\n\nwhere TSA, CSA stand for ‘Total Surface Area’ and ‘Curved Surface Area’\nrespectively.\n\nLet us now consider another situation. Suppose we are making a toy by putting\ntogether a hemisphere and a cone. Let us see the steps that we would be going\nthrough.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nSURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 163\n\nFirst, we would take a cone and a hemisphere and bring their flat faces together.\nHere, of course, we would take the base radius of the cone equal to the radius of the\nhemisphere, for the toy is to have a smooth surface. So, the steps would be as shown\n\nin Fig. 12.5. .\n\n-\nFig. 12.5\n\nAt the end of our trial, we have got ourselves a nice round-bottomed toy. Now if\nwe want to find how much paint we would require to colour the surface of this toy,\nwhat would we need to know? We would need to know the surface area of the toy,\nwhich consists of the CSA of the hemisphere and the CSA of the cone.\n\nSo, we can say:\nTotal surface area of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone\n\nNow, let us consider some examples.\n\nExample 1 : Rasheed gota playing top (/attu) as his\nbirthday present, which surprisingly had no colour on\nit. He wanted to colour it with his crayons. The top is\nshaped like a cone surmounted by a hemisphere\n(see Fig 12.6). The entire top is 5 cm in height and\nthe diameter of the top is 3.5 cm. Find the area he\n\nFig. 12.6\n\n22\nhas to colour. (Take m = > )\n\nSolution : This top is exactly like the object we have discussed in Fig. 12.5. So, we\ncan conveniently use the result we have arrived at there. That is :\n\nTSA of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone\n\n: 1 2 2\nNow, the curved surface area of the hemisphere = zo ) = 2mr\n\n22 3.5 3.5 2\n= |2x x x cm\n7 2 2\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n164 MATHEMATICS\n\nAlso, the height of the cone = height of the top — height (radius) of the hemispherical part\n\n3.5\n= | 3 3 cm = 3,25 cm\n\n2\n3.5\nSo, the slant height of the cone (/) = Vr +h? = V8) + (3.25)? cm =3,7 cm (approx.)\n\n22 | 3.5\nTherefore, CSA of cone = nr/ = 7% 5 x 3.7\n\nThis gives the surface area of the top as\n\n= ae\n\n7 2 2\n22 11\n=x = (3.5 + 3.7) cm? = = 3% (3.5 + 3.7) em? = 39.6 cm?

Here, we shall see how to calculate their\nvolumes. It may be noted that in calculating the surface area, we have not added the\nsurface areas of the two constituents, because some part of the surface area disappeared\nin the process of joining them. However, this will not be the case when we calculate\nthe volume. The volume of the solid formed by joining two basic solids will actually be\nthe sum of the volumes of the constituents, as we see in the examples below.\n\nExample 5 : Shanta runs an industry in\na shed which is in the shape of a cuboid\nsurmounted by a half cylinder (see Fig.\n12.12).

Similarly, while travelling, you may have\nseen some big and beautiful buildings or monuments\nmade up of a combination of solids mentioned above.\n\nIf for some reason you wanted to find the\nsurface areas, or volumes, or capacities of such\nobjects, how would you do it? We cannot classify\n\nthese under any of the solids you have already studied. Fig. 12.3\n\nIn this chapter, you will see how to find surface areas and volumes of such\nobjects.\n\n12.2 Surface Area of a Combination of Solids\n\nLet us consider the container seen in Fig. 12.2. How do we find the surface area of\nsuch a solid? Now, whenever we come across a new problem, we first try to see, if\nwe can break it down into smaller problems, we have earlier solved. We can see that\nthis solid is made up of a cylinder with two hemispheres stuck at either end. It would\nlook like what we have in Fig. 12.4, after we put the pieces all together.\n\n(Gil )\n\nFig. 12.4\nIf we consider the surface of the newly formed object, we would be able to see\nonly the curved surfaces of the two hemispheres and the curved surface of the cylinder.\n\nSo, the total surface area of the new solid is the sum of the curved surface\nareas of each of the individual parts. This gives,\n\nTSA of new solid = CSA of one hemisphere + CSA of cylinder\n+ CSA of other hemisphere\n\nwhere TSA, CSA stand for ‘Total Surface Area’ and ‘Curved Surface Area’\nrespectively.\n\nLet us now consider another situation. Suppose we are making a toy by putting\ntogether a hemisphere and a cone. Let us see the steps that we would be going\nthrough.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

You have also learnt to represent the data pictorially\nin the form of various graphs such as bar graphs, histograms (including those of varying\nwidths) and frequency polygons. In fact, you went a step further by studying certain\nnumerical representatives of the ungrouped data, also called measures of central\ntendency, namely, mean, median and mode. In this chapter, we shall extend the study\nof these three measures, i.e., mean, median and mode from ungrouped data to that of\ngrouped data. We shall also discuss the concept of cumulative frequency, the\ncumulative frequency distribution and how to draw cumulative frequency curves, called\nogives.\n\n13.2 Mean of Grouped Data\n\nThe mean (or average) of observations, as we know, is the sum of the values of all the\nobservations divided by the total number of observations. From Class IX, recall that if\nX,, Xy..., X, are observations with respective frequencies f,, f,, . . ., f, then this\nmeans observation x, occurs f, times, x, occurs f, times, and so on.\n\nNow, the sum of the values of all the observations =fix,+fx,+...+fx,, and\nthe number of observations =f, +f,+...+f,.\n\nSo, the mean x of the data is given by\nxX _ AX + fyX tot LX\nSith tort th\n\nRecall that we can write this in short form by using the Greek letter X (capital\nsigma) which means summation. That is,\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nYe\n\nLSI x,\n\nEf , 1f it is understood that i varies from\n\ni\n\nwhich, more briefly, is written as ¥ =\n1 ton.\n\nLet us apply this formula to find the mean in the following example.\n\nThe marks obtained by 30 students of Class X of a certain school in a\nMathematics paper consisting of 100 marks are presented in table below. Find the\nmean of the marks obtained by the students.\n\nMarks obtained | 10 | 20 | 36 | 40 | 50 | 56 70 | 72 88 | 92 | 95\n(x;)\n\nNumber of {| 1/1 /3 }/4]3]/2)])4]4y]1)14)2~4)3~41\nstudents (/))\n\nRecall that to find the mean marks, we require the product of each x, with\nthe corresponding frequency f. So, let us put them in a column as shown in Table 13.1.\n\nMarks obtained (x,) Number of students (/)) Te\n\n6 SoS IS SS Ses IS eS Ss\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nSTATISTICS 173\n\nZfx, 1779\nMi = —— = 593\n=f 30\n\nNow, x=\n\nTherefore, the mean marks obtained is 59.3.\n\nIn most of our real life situations, data is usually so large that to make a meaningful\nstudy it needs to be condensed as grouped data. So, we need to convert given ungrouped\ndata into grouped data and devise some method to find its mean.\n\nLet us convert the ungrouped data of Example | into grouped data by forming\nclass-intervals of width, say 15. Remember that, while allocating frequencies to each\nclass-interval, students falling in any upper class-limit would be considered in the next\nclass, e.g., 4 students who have obtained 40 marks would be considered in the class-\ninterval 40-55 and not in 25-40. With this convention in our mind, let us form a grouped\nfrequency distribution table (see Table 13.2).\n\nTable 13.2\n\nNow, for each class-interval, we require a point which would serve as the\nrepresentative of the whole class. Jt is assumed that the frequency of each class-\ninterval is centred around its mid-point. So the mid-point (or class mark) of each\nclass can be chosen to represent the observations falling in the class. Recall that we\nfind the mid-point of a class (or its class mark) by finding the average of its upper and\nlower limits. That is,\n\nUpper class limit + Lower class limit\n2\n\nClass mark =\n\n10+ 25\n2\n17.5. Similarly, we can find the class marks of the remaining class intervals. We put\nthem in Table 13.3. These class marks serve as our x,’s. Now, in general, for the ith\nclass interval, we have the frequency f, corresponding to the class mark x,. We can\n\nnow proceed to compute the mean in the same manner as in Example 1.\n\nWith reference to Table 13.2, for the class 10-25, the class mark is ,1€.,\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n174 MATHEMATICS\n\nTable 13.3\n\nThe sum of the values in the last column gives us 2 f.x,. So, the mean x of the\ngiven data is given by\n\nUx; _ 1860.0 _ 62\nXf, 30\nThis new method of finding the mean is known as the Direct Method.\n\nX=\n\nWe observe that Tables 13.1 and 13.3 are using the same data and employing the\nsame formula for the calculation of the mean but the results obtained are different.\nCan you think why this is so, and which one is more accurate? The difference in the\ntwo values is because of the mid-point assumption in Table 13.3, 59.3 being the exact\nmean, while 62 an approximate mean.\n\nSometimes when the numerical values of x, and f, are large, finding the product\nof x, and f, becomes tedious and time consuming. So, for such situations, let us think of\na method of reducing these calculations.\n\nWe can do nothing with the fs, but we can change each x, to a smaller number\nso that our calculations become easy. How do we do this? What about subtracting a\nfixed number from each of these x,’s? Let us try this method.\n\nThe first step is to choose one among the x’ as the assumed mean, and denote\nit by ‘a’. Also, to further reduce our calculation work, we may take ‘a’ to be that x,\nwhich lies in the centre of x,, x,, . . ., x,. So, we can choose a = 47.5 or a = 62.5. Let\nus choose a = 47.5.\n\nThe next step is to find the difference d, between a and each of the x,’s, that is,\nthe deviation of ‘a’ from each of the x,’s.\n\nie., d,=x,-a=x,— 47.5\n\nL\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nSTATISTICS 5\n\nThe third step is to find the product of d, with the corresponding f,, and take the sum\nof all the f,d,’s. The calculations are shown in Table 13.4.\n\nTable 13.4\n\n4 Yfd.\nSo, from Table 13.4, the mean of the deviations, d = > -\n\nNow, let us find the relation between d and xX.\nSince in obtaining d,, we subtracted ‘a’ from each x,, so, in order to get the mean\n\n¥ , we need to add ‘a’ to d . This can be explained mathematically as:\n\nFa Yfd.\nMean of deviations, d= 7\n= Lf, (x, -— a\nSo, d= Wii = @)\nXf\nLx, Ufia\n> >:\nLf.\n= XxX acti\n“fi\n=x-a\nSo, X=atd\nYf.d.\nie X= 4 hide ;\nS D2\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n176 MATHEMATICS\n\nSubstituting the values of a, Ufd, and Xf, from Table 13.4, we get\n\nx= 415+ > = 4754145 =62.\n\nTherefore, the mean of the marks obtained by the students is 62.\nThe method discussed above is called the Assumed Mean Method.\n\nActivity 1 : From the Table 13.3 find the mean by taking each of x, (i.e., 17.5, 32.5,\nand so on) as ‘a’. What do you observe? You will find that the mean determined in\neach case is the same, i.e., 62. (Why ?)\n\nSo, we can say that the value of the mean obtained does not depend on the\nchoice of ‘a’.\n\nObserve that in Table 13.4, the values in Column 4 are all multiples of 15. So, if\nwe divide the values in the entire Column 4 by 15, we would get smaller numbers to\nmultiply with f. (Here, 15 is the class size of each class interval.)\n\nXj\n\na . , .\n, where a is the assumed mean and /1 is the class size.\n\nSo, let u, =\n\nNow, we calculate wu, in this way and continue as before (i.e., find fu, and\nthen Yfu,). Taking h = 15, let us form Table 13.5.\n\nTable 13.5\n\nLiu;\nXfi\n\nHere, again let us find the relation between w and x.\n\nLet u =\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nSTATISTICS 177\n\nxX,-a\nWe have, “=\n; h\n(x; — 4)\nxp Si :\nTherefore, a = hn _1| 2x, — ahi\nxf h| Sf\n1| 2x; a >,\n> >?\n1,_\n= —|xX-a\nMeal\nSo, hu = x - a\n1.€., x=athu\nSo xS@t i 2)\nb yf,\n\nNow, substituting the values of a, h, Xfu, and Xf, from Table 14.5, we get\nx = 475+15~x (+)\n30\n\n= 47.5+14.5=62\nSo, the mean marks obtained by a student is 62.\nThe method discussed above is called the Step-deviation method.\nWe note that :\n\ne the step-deviation method will be convenient to apply if all the d,s have a\ncommon factor.\n\ne The mean obtained by all the three methods is the same.\n\ne The assumed mean method and step-deviation method are just simplified\nforms of the direct method.\n\ne The formula ¥ =a+ hu still holds ifa and / are not as given above, but are\n\n-—a\n\nx;\n\nany non-zero numbers such that wu, =\n\nLet us apply these methods in another example.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nThe table below gives the percentage distribution of female teachers in\nthe primary schools of rural areas of various states and union territories (U.T.) of\nIndia.

So the choice of\nmethod to be used depends on the numerical values of x, and f. If x, and f, are\nsufficiently small, then the direct method is an appropriate choice. If x, and f, are\nnumerically large numbers, then we can go for the assumed mean method or\nstep-deviation method. If the class sizes are unequal, and x, are large numerically, we\ncan still apply the step-deviation method by taking / to be a suitable divisor of all the d,’s.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n3: The distribution below shows the number of wickets taken by bowlers in\none-day cricket matches.

Mode of Grouped Data\n\nRecall from Class IX, a mode is that value among the observations which occurs most\noften, that is, the value of the observation having the maximum frequency. Further, we\ndiscussed finding the mode of ungrouped data. Here, we shall discuss ways of obtaining\na mode of grouped data. It is possible that more than one value may have the same\nmaximum frequency. In such situations, the data is said to be multimodal. Though\ngrouped data can also be multimodal, we shall restrict ourselves to problems having a\nsingle mode only.\n\nLet us first recall how we found the mode for ungrouped data through the following\nexample.\n\nExample 4 : The wickets taken by a bowler in 10 cricket matches are as follows:\nZ 6 4 5 0 2 1 3 2 3\nFind the mode of the data.\n\nSolution : Let us form the frequency distribution table of the given data as follows:\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n184 MATHEMATICS\n\nClearly, 2 is the number of wickets taken by the bowler in the maximum number\n(i.e., 3) of matches. So, the mode of this data is 2.\n\nIn a grouped frequency distribution, it is not possible to determine the mode by\nlooking at the frequencies. Here, we can only locate a class with the maximum\nfrequency, called the modal class. The mode is a value inside the modal class, and is\ngiven by the formula:\n\nMode = 1{ Ah)\n2f, a 07 f; 9,\nwhere /= lower limit of the modal class,\nh = size of the class interval (assuming all class sizes to be equal),\nJ, = frequency of the modal class,\nJ, = frequency of the class preceding the modal class,\nJ, = frequency of the class succeeding the modal class.\nLet us consider the following examples to illustrate the use of this formula.\nExample 5: A survey conducted on 20 households in a locality by a group of students\n\nresulted in the following frequency table for the number of family members in a\nhousehold:\n\nFind the mode of this data.\n\nSolution : Here the maximum class frequency is 8, and the class corresponding to this\nfrequency is 3 — 5. So, the modal class is 3 — 5.\n\nNow\nmodal class = 3—5, lower limit (/) of modal class = 3, class size (h) = 2\nfrequency (/,) of the modal class = 8,\nfrequency (f,) of class preceding the modal class = 7,\nfrequency ( f,) of class succeeding the modal class = 2.\n\nNow, let us substitute these values in the formula :\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nSTATISTICS 185\n\nMode = 1+ fix So J\n\n2fhi- fo — fy\n\n= 34 an7 x 2=3+2=3,286\nIx8—-7-2 7\n\nTherefore, the mode of the data above is 3.286.\n\nExample 6 : The marks distribution of 30 students in a mathematics examination are\ngiven in Table 13.3 of Example 1. Find the mode of this data. Also compare and\ninterpret the mode and the mean.\n\nSolution : Refer to Table 13.3 of Example 1. Since the maximum number of students\n(i.e., 7) have got marks in the interval 40 - 55, the modal class is 40 - 55. Therefore,\n\nthe lower limit (/) of the modal class = 40,\n\nthe class size (h) = 15,\n\nthe frequency (f,) of modal class = 7,\n\nthe frequency (f,) of the class preceding the modal class = 3,\nthe frequency (f,) of the class succeeding the modal class = 6.\n\nNow, using the formula:\n\nMode = (Aah Joa,\n\n73\n14-6-3\n\nwe get Mode = sor }. 15 = 52\n\nSo, the mode marks is 52.\nNow, from Example 1, you know that the mean marks is 62.\n\nSo, the maximum number of students obtained 52 marks, while on an average a\nstudent obtained 62 marks.\n\nRemarks :\n\n1. In Example 6, the mode is less than the mean. But for some other problems it may\nbe equal or more than the mean also.\n\n2. It depends upon the demand of the situation whether we are interested in finding the\naverage marks obtained by the students or the average of the marks obtained by most\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n186 MATHEMATICS\n\nof the students. In the first situation, the mean is required and in the second situation,\nthe mode is required.\n\nActivity 3 : Continuing with the same groups as formed in Activity 2 and the situations\nassigned to the groups. Ask each group to find the mode of the data. They should also\ncompare this with the mean, and interpret the meaning of both.\n\nRemark : The mode can also be calculated for grouped data with unequal class sizes.\nHowever, we shall not be discussing it.\n\nEXERCISE 13.2\n\n1.

Recall that for finding the\nmedian of ungrouped data, we first arrange the data values of the observations in\n\nn+1\nascending order. Then, if 7 1s odd, the median is the ae) th observation. And, ifn\n\nis even, then the median will be the average of the 5th and the (4 + th observations.\n\nSuppose, we have to find the median of the following data, which gives the\nmarks, out of 50, obtained by 100 students in a test :\n\nFirst, we arrange the marks in ascending order and prepare a frequency table as\nfollows :\n\nTable 13.9\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nHere 1 = 100, which is even. The median will be the average of the 5th and the\n\nG + i observations, i.e., the 50th and 5lst observations. To find these\n\nobservations, we proceed as follows:\nTable 13.10\n\nMarks obtained Number of students\n\n6\n655 20'=26\n26 + 24=50\nS028 78\n78 + 1593\n93Nyd S 97\nMBs Oe\n997 1=100\n\nNow we add another column depicting this information to the frequency table\nabove and name it as cumulative frequency column.\n\nTable 13.11\n\nMarks obtained Number of students Cumulative frequency\n\n6\n20\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n190 MATHEMATICS\n\nFrom the table above, we see that:\n50th observaton is 28 (Why?)\n\n51st observation is 29\n\n28 + 29\n\nSo, Median = = 28.5\n\nRemark : The part of Table 13.11 consisting Column 1 and Column 3 is known as\nCumulative Frequency Table. The median marks 28.5 conveys the information that\nabout 50% students obtained marks less than 28.5 and another 50% students obtained\nmarks more than 28.5.\n\nNow, let us see how to obtain the median of grouped data, through the following\nsituation.\n\nConsider a grouped frequency distribution of marks obtained, out of 100, by 53\nstudents, in a certain examination, as follows:\n\nTable 13.12\n\nFrom the table above, try to answer the following questions:\n\nHow many students have scored marks less than 10? The answer is clearly 5.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nSTATISTICS 191\n\nHow many students have scored less than 20 marks? Observe that the number\nof students who have scored less than 20 include the number of students who have\nscored marks from 0 - 10 as well as the number of students who have scored marks\nfrom 10 - 20. So, the total number of students with marks less than 20 is 5 + 3, i.e., 8.\nWe say that the cumulative frequency of the class 10-20 is 8.\n\nSimilarly, we can compute the cumulative frequencies of the other classes, i.e.,\nthe number of students with marks less than 30, less than 40, . . ., less than 100. We\ngive them in Table 13.13 given below:\n\nTable 13.13\n\nThe distribution given above is called the cumulative frequency distribution of\nthe less than type. Here 10, 20, 30, . . . 100, are the upper limits of the respective\nclass intervals.\n\nWe can similarly make the table for the number of students with scores, more\nthan or equal to 0, more than or equal to 10, more than or equal to 20, and so on. From\nTable 13.12, we observe that all 53 students have scored marks more than or equal to\n0. Since there are 5 students scoring marks in the interval 0 - 10, this means that there\n\nare 53 — 5 = 48 students getting more than or equal to 10 marks. Continuing in the\nsame manner, we get the number of students scoring 20 or above as 48 — 3 = 45, 30 or\nabove as 45 — 4 = 41, and so on, as shown in Table 13.14.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nTable 13.14\n\nMarks obtained Number of students\n(Cumulative frequency)\n\nMore than or equal to 0\n\nMore than or equal to 10\nMore than or equal to 20\nMore than or equal to 30\n\nMore than or equal to 40\nMore than or equal to 50\nMore than or equal to 60\nMore than or equal to 70\nMore than or equal to 80\nMore than or equal to 90\n\nThe table above is called a cumulative frequency distribution of the more\nthan type. Here 0, 10, 20, . . ., 90 give the lower limits of the respective class intervals.\n\nNow, to find the median of grouped data, we can make use of any of these\ncumulative frequency distributions.\n\nLet us combine Tables 13.12 and 13.13 to get Table 13.15 given below:\nTable 13.15\n\nNumber of students (f) Cumulative frequency (cf)\n\n5\n3\n4\n3\n3\n4\n7\n9\n7\n8\n\nNow in a grouped data, we may not be able to find the middle observation by\nlooking at the cumulative frequencies as the middle observation will be some value in\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nSTATISTICS 193\n\na class interval. It is, therefore, necessary to find the value inside a class that divides\nthe whole distribution into two halves. But which class should this be?\n\nn\n5:\nWe now locate the class whose cumulative frequency is greater than (and nearest to)\n\nTo find this class, we find the cumulative frequencies of all the classes and\n\nn\nae This is called the median class.

So, > = 26.5.\n\nNow 60 — 70 is the class whose cumulative frequency 29 is greater than (and nearest\n\nnN .\nto) > , 1.e., 26.5.\n\nTherefore, 60 — 70 is the median class.\n\nAfter finding the median class, we use the following formula for calculating the\nmedian.\n\n-cf\n\nn\nMedian= / +| 2 xh,\n\nwhere 1= lower limit of median class,\nn= number of observations,\ncf = cumulative frequency of class preceding the median class,\nf= frequency of median class,\n\nh= class size (assuming class size to be equal).\n\nn\nSubstituting the values on. 26.5, 1= 60, cf= 22, f=7, h= 10\n\nin the formula above, we get\n\nMedian = 60 + [5-2] x 10\n\n45\n= 60+ 7\n= 66.4\nSo, about half the students have scored marks less than 66.4, and the other half have\nscored marks more than 66.4.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nExan A survey regarding the heights (in cm) of 51 girls of Class X of a school\nwas conducted and the following data was obtained:\n\nHeight (in cm) Number of girls\n4\n11\n\nLess than 140\nLess than 145\nLess than 150 29\nLess than 155 40\nLess than 160 46\nLess than 165 51\n\nFind the median height.\n\n1: To calculate the median height, we need to find the class intervals and their\ncorresponding frequencies.\n\nThe given distribution being of the /ess than type, 140, 145, 150,..., 165 give the\nupper limits of the corresponding class intervals. So, the classes should be below 140,\n140 - 145, 145 - 150, .. ., 160 - 165. Observe that from the given distribution, we find\nthat there are 4 girls with height less than 140, 1.e., the frequency of class interval\nbelow 140 is 4. Now, there are 11 girls with heights less than 145 and 4 girls with\nheight less than 140. Therefore, the number of girls with height in the interval\n140 - 145 is 11 —4 = 7. Similarly, the frequency of 145 - 150 is 29 — 11 = 18, for\n150 - 155, it is 40 — 29 = 11, and so on. So, our frequency distribution table with the\ngiven cumulative frequencies becomes:\n\nTable 13.16\n\nBelow 140\n140 - 145\n\n145 - 150\n150-155\n155 - 160\n160 - 165\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nSTATISTICS 195\n\nn_5l ; oe\nNow n=51.So, . 3s 25.5 .

It also enables us to compare two or\nmore distributions. For example, by comparing the average (mean) results of students\nof different schools of a particular examination, we can conclude which school has a\n\nbetter performance.\n\nHowever, extreme values in the data affect the mean. For example, the mean of\nclasses having frequencies more or less the same is a good representative of the data.\nBut, if one class has frequency, say 2, and the five others have frequency 20, 25, 20,\n21, 18, then the mean will certainly not reflect the way the data behaves. So, in such\ncases, the mean is not a good representative of the data.\n\nIn problems where individual observations are not important, and we wish to find\nout a ‘typical’ observation, the median is more appropriate, e.g., finding the typical\nproductivity rate of workers, average wage in a country, etc. These are situations\nwhere extreme values may be there. So, rather than the mean, we take the median as\n\na better measure of central tendency.\n\nIn situations which require establishing the most frequent value or most popular\nitem, the mode is the best choice, e.g., to find the most popular T. V. programme being\nwatched, the consumer item in greatest demand, the colour of the vehicle used by\nmost of the people, etc.\n\nRemarks :\n\n1. There is a empirical relationship between the three measures of central tendency :\n3 Median = Mode + 2 Mean\n\n2. The median of grouped data with unequal class sizes can also be calculated.

You have also learnt to represent the data pictorially\nin the form of various graphs such as bar graphs, histograms (including those of varying\nwidths) and frequency polygons. In fact, you went a step further by studying certain\nnumerical representatives of the ungrouped data, also called measures of central\ntendency, namely, mean, median and mode. In this chapter, we shall extend the study\nof these three measures, i.e., mean, median and mode from ungrouped data to that of\ngrouped data. We shall also discuss the concept of cumulative frequency, the\ncumulative frequency distribution and how to draw cumulative frequency curves, called\nogives.\n\n13.2 Mean of Grouped Data\n\nThe mean (or average) of observations, as we know, is the sum of the values of all the\nobservations divided by the total number of observations. From Class IX, recall that if\nX,, Xy..., X, are observations with respective frequencies f,, f,, . . ., f, then this\nmeans observation x, occurs f, times, x, occurs f, times, and so on.\n\nNow, the sum of the values of all the observations =fix,+fx,+...+fx,, and\nthe number of observations =f, +f,+...+f,.\n\nSo, the mean x of the data is given by\nxX _ AX + fyX tot LX\nSith tort th\n\nRecall that we can write this in short form by using the Greek letter X (capital\nsigma) which means summation.

So, we need to convert given ungrouped\ndata into grouped data and devise some method to find its mean.\n\nLet us convert the ungrouped data of Example | into grouped data by forming\nclass-intervals of width, say 15. Remember that, while allocating frequencies to each\nclass-interval, students falling in any upper class-limit would be considered in the next\nclass, e.g., 4 students who have obtained 40 marks would be considered in the class-\ninterval 40-55 and not in 25-40. With this convention in our mind, let us form a grouped\nfrequency distribution table (see Table 13.2).\n\nTable 13.2\n\nNow, for each class-interval, we require a point which would serve as the\nrepresentative of the whole class. Jt is assumed that the frequency of each class-\ninterval is centred around its mid-point. So the mid-point (or class mark) of each\nclass can be chosen to represent the observations falling in the class. Recall that we\nfind the mid-point of a class (or its class mark) by finding the average of its upper and\nlower limits. That is,\n\nUpper class limit + Lower class limit\n2\n\nClass mark =\n\n10+ 25\n2\n17.5. Similarly, we can find the class marks of the remaining class intervals. We put\nthem in Table 13.3. These class marks serve as our x,’s. Now, in general, for the ith\nclass interval, we have the frequency f, corresponding to the class mark x,. We can\n\nnow proceed to compute the mean in the same manner as in Example 1.\n\nWith reference to Table 13.2, for the class 10-25, the class mark is ,1€.,\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

It also enables us to compare two or\nmore distributions. For example, by comparing the average (mean) results of students\nof different schools of a particular examination, we can conclude which school has a\n\nbetter performance.\n\nHowever, extreme values in the data affect the mean. For example, the mean of\nclasses having frequencies more or less the same is a good representative of the data.\nBut, if one class has frequency, say 2, and the five others have frequency 20, 25, 20,\n21, 18, then the mean will certainly not reflect the way the data behaves. So, in such\ncases, the mean is not a good representative of the data.\n\nIn problems where individual observations are not important, and we wish to find\nout a ‘typical’ observation, the median is more appropriate, e.g., finding the typical\nproductivity rate of workers, average wage in a country, etc. These are situations\nwhere extreme values may be there. So, rather than the mean, we take the median as\n\na better measure of central tendency.\n\nIn situations which require establishing the most frequent value or most popular\nitem, the mode is the best choice, e.g., to find the most popular T.

Woodward\n\n14.1 Probability — A Theoretical Approach\n\nLet us consider the following situation :\n\nSuppose a coin is tossed at random.\n\nWe know, in advance, that the coin can only land in one of two possible ways —\neither head up or tail up (we dismiss the possibility of its ‘landing’ on its edge, which\nmay be possible, for example, if it falls on sand). We can reasonably assume that each\noutcome, head or tail, is as likely to occur as the other. We refer to this by saying that\nthe outcomes head and tail, are equally likely.\n\nFor another example of equally likely outcomes, suppose we throw a die\nonce. For us, a die will always mean a fair die. What are the possible outcomes?\nThey are 1, 2, 3, 4,5, 6. Each number has the same possibility of showing up. So\nthe equally likely outcomes of throwing a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nPROBABILITY 203\n\nAre the outcomes of every experiment equally likely? Let us see.\n\nSuppose that a bag contains 4 red balls and 1 blue ball, and you draw a ball\nwithout looking into the bag. What are the outcomes? Are the outcomes — a red ball\nand a blue ball equally likely? Since there are 4 red balls and only one blue ball, you\nwould agree that you are more likely to get a red ball than a blue ball. So, the outcomes\n(a red ball or a blue ball) are not equally likely. However, the outcome of drawing a\nball of any colour from the bag is equally likely. So, all experiments do not necessarily\nhave equally likely outcomes.\n\nHowever, in this chapter, from now on, we will assume that all the experiments\nhave equally likely outcomes.\n\nIn Class IX, we defined the experimental or empirical probability P(E) of an\nevent E as\n\nNumber of trials in which the event happened\n\nP(E) = Total number of trials\n\nThe empirical interpretation of probability can be applied to every event associated\nwith an experiment which can be repeated a large number of times. The requirement\nof repeating an experiment has some limitations, as it may be very expensive or\nunfeasible in many situations. Of course, it worked well in coin tossing or die throwing\nexperiments. But how about repeating the experiment of launching a satellite in order\nto compute the empirical probability ofits failure during launching, or the repetition of\nthe phenomenon of an earthquake to compute the empirical probability of a multi-\nstoreyed building getting destroyed in an earthquake?\n\nIn experiments where we are prepared to make certain assumptions, the repetition\nof an experiment can be avoided, as the assumptions help in directly calculating the\nexact (theoretical) probability. The assumption of equally likely outcomes (which is\nvalid in many experiments, as in the two examples above, of a coin and of a die) is one\nsuch assumption that leads us to the following definition of probability of an event.\n\nThe theoretical probability (also called classical probability) of an event E,\nwritten as P(E), is defined as\n\nP(E) = Number of outcomes favourable to E\n\nbd\nNumber of all possible outcomes of the experiment\n\nwhere we assume that the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely.\nWe will briefly refer to theoretical probability as probability.\nThis definition of probability was given by Pierre Simon Laplace in 1795.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n204 MATHEMATICS\n\nProbability theory had its origin in the 16th century when\nan Italian physician and mathematician J.Cardan wrote the\nfirst book on the subject, The Book on Games of Chance.\nSince its inception, the study of probability has attracted\nthe attention of great mathematicians. James Bernoulli\n(1654 — 1705), A. de Moivre (1667 — 1754), and\nPierre Simon Laplace are among those who made significant\ncontributions to this field. Laplace’s Theorie Analytique\ndes Probabilités, 1812, is considered to be the greatest\ncontribution by a single person to the theory of probability. Pierre Simon Laplace\nIn recent years, probability has been used extensively in (1749 — 1827)\nmany areas such as biology, economics, genetics, physics,\n\nsociology etc.\n\nLet us find the probability for some of the events associated with experiments\nwhere the equally likely assumption holds.\n\nExample 1 : Find the probability of getting a head when a coin is tossed once. Also\nfind the probability of getting a tail.\n\nSolution : In the experiment of tossing a coin once, the number of possible outcomes\nis two — Head (H) and Tail (T). Let E be the event ‘getting a head’. The number of\noutcomes favourable to E, (i.e., of getting a head) is 1. Therefore,\n\nNumber of outcomes favourable to E 1\n\nP(E) = P (head) =\n) Piet) Number of all possible outcomes 2\n\nSimilarly, if F is the event ‘getting a tail’, then\n\nP(F) = P(tail) = > (Why ?)\n\nExample 2 : A bag contains a red ball, a blue ball and a yellow ball, all the balls being\nof the same size. Kritika takes out a ball from the bag without looking into it. What is\nthe probability that she takes out the\n\n(1) yellow ball? (ii) red ball? (iti) blue ball?\n\nSolution : Kritika takes out a ball from the bag without looking into it. So, itis equally\nlikely that she takes out any one of them.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nPROBABILITY 205\n\nLet Y be the event ‘the ball taken out is yellow’, B be the event ‘the ball taken\nout is blue’, and R be the event ‘the ball taken out is red’.\n\nNow, the number of possible outcomes = 3.\n\n(i) The number of outcomes favourable to the event Y = 1.\n\nSo, P(Y) =\n\nand (iii) P(B) = !\n\nSimilarly, (ii) P(R) = 3\n\nWile wile\n\nRemarks :\n\n1. An event having only one outcome of the experiment is called an elementary\nevent. In Example 1, both the events E and F are elementary events. Similarly, in\nExample 2, all the three events, Y, B and R are elementary events.\n\n2. In Example 1, we note that : P(E) + P(F) = 1\nIn Example 2, we note that : P(Y) + P(R) + P(B) = 1\n\nObserve that the sum of the probabilities of all the elementary events of\nan experiment is |. This is true in general also.\n\nExample 3 : Suppose we throw a die once. (1) What is the probability of getting a\nnumber greater than 4 ? (11) What is the probability of getting a number less than or\nequal to 4?\n\nSolution : (4) Here, let E be the event ‘getting a number greater than 4’. The number\nof possible outcomes is six : 1, 2,3, 4,5 and 6, and the outcomes favourable to E are 5\nand 6. Therefore, the number of outcomes favourable to E is 2. So,\n\n2 1\nP(E) = P(number greater than 4) = 63\n\n(ii) Let F be the event ‘getting a number less than or equal to 4’.\nNumber of possible outcomes = 6\nOutcomes favourable to the event F are 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nSo, the number of outcomes favourable to F is 4.\n\nTherefore, P(F)= >=\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n206 MATHEMATICS\n\nAre the events E and F in the example above elementary events? No, they are\nnot because the event E has 2 outcomes and the event F has 4 outcomes.\n\nRemarks : From Example 1, we note that\n\n1 1\nP(E) + P(F) = a tan 4 (1)\n\nwhere E is the event ‘getting a head’ and F is the event ‘getting a tail’.\nFrom (1) and (11) of Example 3, we also get\n\n1 2\nP(E) + P(F) = atg (2)\n\nwhere E is the event ‘getting a number >4’ and F is the event ‘getting a number < 4’.\n\nNote that getting a number not greater than 4 is same as getting a number less\nthan or equal to 4, and vice versa.\n\nIn (1) and (2) above, is F not the same as ‘not E’? Yes, it is. We denote the event\n\n‘not E’ by E.\nSo, P(E) + P(not E) = 1\nLe., P(E) + P(E) = 1, which givesus P(E) =1-— P(E).\n\nIn general, it is true that for an event E,\nP(E) = 1- P(E)\nThe event E, representing ‘not E’, is called the complement of the event E.\nWe also say that E and E are complementary events.\nBefore proceeding further, let us try to find the answers to the following questions:\n(i) What is the probability of getting a number 8 in a single throw of a die?\n(ii) What is the probability of getting a number less than 7 ina single throw of a die?\nLet us answer (i) :\n\nWe know that there are only six possible outcomes in a single throw of a die. These\n\noutcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Since no face of the die is marked 8, so there is no\noutcome favourable to 8, i.e., the number of such outcomes is zero. In other words,\ngetting 8 in a single throw of a die, is impossible.\n\n0\nSo, P(getting 8) = 6° 0\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nPROBABILITY 207\n\nThat is, the probability of an event which is impossible to occur is 0. Such an\nevent is called an impossible event.\n\nLet us answer (ii) :\n\nSince every face of a die is marked with a number less than 7, it is sure that we\nwill always get a number less than 7 when it is thrown once. So, the number of\nfavourable outcomes is the same as the number of all possible outcomes, which is 6.\n\n6\nTherefore, P(E) = P(getting a number less than 7) = a 1\nSo, the probability of an event which is sure (or certain) to occur is 1. Such an event\nis called a sure event or a certain event.\n\nNote : From the definition of the probability P(E), we see that the numerator (number\nof outcomes favourable to the event E) is always less than or equal to the denominator\n\n(the number of all possible outcomes). Therefore,\n0 < P(E) <1\n\nNow, let us take an example related to playing cards. Have you seen a deck of\nplaying cards? It consists of 52 cards which are divided into 4 suits of 13 cards each—\nspades (#), hearts (¥), diamonds (#) and clubs (#). Clubs and spades are of black\ncolour, while hearts and diamonds are of red colour. The cards in each suit are ace,\nking, queen, jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6,5, 4, 3 and 2. Kings, queens and jacks are called face\ncards.\n\nExample 4 : One card is drawn from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. Calculate the\nprobability that the card will\n\n(1) be an ace,\n(ii) not be an ace.\nSolution : Well-shuffling ensures equally likely outcomes.\n(i) There are 4 aces in a deck. Let E be the event ‘the card is an ace’.\nThe number of outcomes favourable to E = 4\nThe number of possible outcomes = 52. (Why ?)\n\n4 1\nTherefore, P(E) = 52 = B\n\n(ii) Let F be the event ‘card drawn is not an ace’.\n\nThe number of outcomes favourable to the event F = 52 -4=48 (Why?)\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n208 MATHEMATICS\n\nThe number of possible outcomes = 52\n\n48 12\nTherefore, P(F) = 32 = B\n\nRemark : Note that F is nothing but E. Therefore, we can also calculate P(F) as\n\nfollows: P(F) = P(E) = 1- P(E) = 1->=—-\n\nExample 5 : Two players, Sangeeta and Reshma, play a tennis match. It is known\nthat the probability of Sangeeta winning the match is 0.62. What is the probability of\nReshma winning the match?\n\nSolution : Let S and R denote the events that Sangeeta wins the match and Reshma\nwins the match, respectively.\n\nThe probability of Sangeeta’s winning = P(S) = 0.62 (given)\nThe probability of Reshma’s winning = P(R) = | — P(S)\n[As the events R and S are complementary]\n= 1-0.62 = 0.38\nExample 6 : Savita and Hamida are friends. What is the probability that both will\nhave (1) different birthdays? (ii) the same birthday? (ignoring a leap year).\n\nSolution : Out of the two friends, one girl, say, Savita’s birthday can be any day of the\nyear. Now, Hamida’s birthday can also be any day of 365 days in the year.\n\nWe assume that these 365 outcomes are equally likely.\n\n(1) If Hamida’s birthday is different from Savita’s, the number of favourable outcomes\nfor her birthday is 365 — 1 =364\n\n364\nSo, P (Hamida’s birthday is different from Savita’s birthday) = 365\n(ii) P(Savita and Hamida have the same birthday)\n= 1—P (both have different birthdays)\n364 . _\n= |-—— Using P =1-P(E\n565 [Using P(E ) (E)]\nos\n365\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nPROBABILITY 209\n\nExample 7 : There are 40 students in Class X of a school of whom 25 are girls and 15\nare boys. The class teacher has to select one student as a class representative. She\nwrites the name of each student on a separate card, the cards being identical. Then\nshe puts cards in a bag and stirs them thoroughly. She then draws one card from the\nbag. What is the probability that the name written on the card is the name of (1) a girl?\n(ii) a boy?\n\nSolution : There are 40 students, and only one name card has to be chosen.\n\n(i) The number of all possible outcomes is 40\n\nThe number of outcomes favourable for a card with the name of a girl = 25 (Why?)\n\n5\nTherefore, P (card with name of a girl) = P(Girl) = 40 = 8\n(it) The number of outcomes favourable for a card with the name of a boy = 15 (Why?)\n3\nTherefore, P(card with name of a boy) = P(Boy) = 20 = .\n\nNote : We can also determine P(Boy), by taking\n\n5 3\nP(Boy) = 1 — P(mot Boy) = 1 — P(Girl) = 1 - 3° 8\n\nExample 8 : A box contains 3 blue, 2 white, and 4 red marbles. If a marble is drawn\nat random from the box, what 1s the probability that it will be\n\n(i) white? (ii) blue? (iii) red?\n\nSolution : Saying that a marble is drawn at random is a short way of saying that all the\nmarbles are equally likely to be drawn. Therefore, the\n\nnumber of possible outcomes = 3 +2 +4 =9 (Why?)\n\nLet W denote the event ‘the marble is white’, B denote the event ‘the marble is blue’\nand R denote the event ‘marble is red’.\n\n(i) The number of outcomes favourable to the event W = 2\n\nSo, P(W) =\n\nSimilarly, (ii) P(B) =\n\nOlW Oly\n\n-1 ng Gay prey 4\n=3 an (iii) P(R)= 9\n\nNote that P(W) + P(B) + P(R) = 1.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n210 MATHEMATICS\n\nExample 9 : Harpreet tosses two different coins simultaneously (say, one is of = 1\nand other of % 2). What is the probability that she gets at least one head?\n\nSolution : We write H for ‘head’ and T for ‘tail’. When two coins are tossed\nsimultaneously, the possible outcomes are (H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T), which are all\nequally likely. Here (H, H) means head up on the first coin (say on ® 1) and head up\non the second coin (% 2). Similarly (H, T) means head up on the first coin and tail up on\nthe second coin and so on.\n\nThe outcomes favourable to the event E, ‘at least one head’ are (H, H), (H, T)\nand (T, H). (Why?)\n\nSo, the number of outcomes favourable to E is 3.\n3\nTherefore, P(E) = a\n\n3\ni.e., the probability that Harpreet gets at least one head is 4\nNote : You can also find P(E) as follows:\n\n_ > % . a =3)\n= = — Since P(E) = P(no head) = —\nP(E)= 1-P(E)=1 uP 4 sine (E) = P(no head) r\n\nDid you observe that in all the examples discussed so far, the number of possible\noutcomes in each experiment was finite? If not, check it now.\n\nThere are many experiments in which the outcome is any number between two\n\ngiven numbers, or in which the outcome is every point within a circle or rectangle, etc.\nCan you now count the number of all possible outcomes? As you know, this is not\npossible since there are infinitely many numbers between two given numbers, or there\nare infinitely many points within a circle. So, the definition of (theoretical) probability\nwhich you have learnt so far cannot be applied in the present form. What is the way\nout? To answer this, let us consider the following example :\nExample 10* : In a musical chair game, the person playing the music has been\nadvised to stop playing the music at any time within 2 minutes after she starts\nplaying. What is the probability that the music will stop within the first half-minute\nafter starting?\n\nSolution : Here the possible outcomes are all the numbers between 0 and 2. This is\nthe portion of the number line from 0 to 2 (see Fig. 14.1).\n\n—\n1\n051 2\n\nFig. 14.1\n\n* Not from the examination point of view.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nPROBABILITY 211\n\nLet E be the event that ‘the music is stopped within the first half-minute’.\n\n. . 1\nThe outcomes favourable to E are points on the number line from 0 to 3\"\n\n1\n\n1\nThe distance from 0 to 2 is 2, while the distance from 0 to 5 iS 5°\n\nSince all the outcomes are equally likely, we can argue that, of the total distance\n\n1\nof 2, the distance favourable to the event E is >:\n\nSo, P(E) =\n\n|\nDistance favourable to the event E _ 2 l\nTotal distance in which outcomes can lie 2\n\nCan we now extend the idea of Example 10 for finding the probability as the ratio of\nthe favourable area to the total area?\n\nExample 11* : A missing helicopter is reported to have crashed somewhere in the\nrectangular region shown in Fig. 14.2. What is the probability that it crashed inside the\nlake shown in the figure?\n\n<< ———.  okm —-~——-— +»\n\n+— 2km—>\n\nSolution : The helicopter is equally likely to crash anywhere in the region.\nArea of the entire region where the helicopter can crash\n= (4.5 x 9) km? = 40.5 km?\n\n* Not from the examination point of view.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n212 MATHEMATICS\n\nArea of the lake = (2.5 x 3) km* = 7.5 km?\n\n. . To 73 _ 3\nTherefore, P (helicopter crashed in the lake) = 405. 405.27\n\nExample 12 : A carton consists of 100 shirts of which 88 are good, 8 have minor\ndefects and 4 have major defects. Jimmy, a trader, will only accept the shirts which\nare good, but Sujatha, another trader, will only reject the shirts which have major\ndefects. One shirt is drawn at random from the carton. What is the probability that\n\n(i) it is acceptable to Jimmy?\n(ii) it is acceptable to Sujatha?\n\nSolution : One shirt is drawn at random from the carton of 100 shirts. Therefore,\nthere are 100 equally likely outcomes.\n\n(1) The number of outcomes favourable (i.e., acceptable) to Jimmy = 88 (Why?)\n\noe . 88\nTherefore, P (shirt is acceptable to Jimmy) = 100 = 0.88\n\n(ii) The number of outcomes favourable to Sujatha = 88+ 8=96 (Why?)\nos . 96\nSo, P (shirt is acceptable to Sujatha) = 100 ~ 0.96\n\nExample 13 : Two dice, one blue and one grey, are thrown at the same time. Write\ndown all the possible outcomes. What is the probability that the sum of the two numbers\nappearing on the top of the dice is\n\n(i) 8? (ii) 13? (iii) less than or equal to 12?\n\nSolution : When the blue die shows ‘1’, the grey die could show any one of the\nnumbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The same is true when the blue die shows ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘4’, ‘5’ or\n‘6’.

An event having only one outcome is called an elementary event. The sum of the\nprobabilities of all the elementary events of an experiment is 1.\n\n6.

As the number of trials in an experiment, go on\nincreasing we may expect the experimental and theoretical\nprobabilities to be nearly the same.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

Woodward\n\n14.1 Probability — A Theoretical Approach\n\nLet us consider the following situation :\n\nSuppose a coin is tossed at random.\n\nWe know, in advance, that the coin can only land in one of two possible ways —\neither head up or tail up (we dismiss the possibility of its ‘landing’ on its edge, which\nmay be possible, for example, if it falls on sand). We can reasonably assume that each\noutcome, head or tail, is as likely to occur as the other. We refer to this by saying that\nthe outcomes head and tail, are equally likely.\n\nFor another example of equally likely outcomes, suppose we throw a die\nonce. For us, a die will always mean a fair die. What are the possible outcomes?\nThey are 1, 2, 3, 4,5, 6. Each number has the same possibility of showing up. So\nthe equally likely outcomes of throwing a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

Let us see.\n\nSuppose that a bag contains 4 red balls and 1 blue ball, and you draw a ball\nwithout looking into the bag. What are the outcomes? Are the outcomes — a red ball\nand a blue ball equally likely? Since there are 4 red balls and only one blue ball, you\nwould agree that you are more likely to get a red ball than a blue ball. So, the outcomes\n(a red ball or a blue ball) are not equally likely. However, the outcome of drawing a\nball of any colour from the bag is equally likely. So, all experiments do not necessarily\nhave equally likely outcomes.\n\nHowever, in this chapter, from now on, we will assume that all the experiments\nhave equally likely outcomes.\n\nIn Class IX, we defined the experimental or empirical probability P(E) of an\nevent E as\n\nNumber of trials in which the event happened\n\nP(E) = Total number of trials\n\nThe empirical interpretation of probability can be applied to every event associated\nwith an experiment which can be repeated a large number of times. The requirement\nof repeating an experiment has some limitations, as it may be very expensive or\nunfeasible in many situations. Of course, it worked well in coin tossing or die throwing\nexperiments. But how about repeating the experiment of launching a satellite in order\nto compute the empirical probability ofits failure during launching, or the repetition of\nthe phenomenon of an earthquake to compute the empirical probability of a multi-\nstoreyed building getting destroyed in an earthquake?\n\nIn experiments where we are prepared to make certain assumptions, the repetition\nof an experiment can be avoided, as the assumptions help in directly calculating the\nexact (theoretical) probability. The assumption of equally likely outcomes (which is\nvalid in many experiments, as in the two examples above, of a coin and of a die) is one\nsuch assumption that leads us to the following definition of probability of an event.\n\nThe theoretical probability (also called classical probability) of an event E,\nwritten as P(E), is defined as\n\nP(E) = Number of outcomes favourable to E\n\nbd\nNumber of all possible outcomes of the experiment\n\nwhere we assume that the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely.\nWe will briefly refer to theoretical probability as probability.\nThis definition of probability was given by Pierre Simon Laplace in 1795.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

James Bernoulli\n(1654 — 1705), A. de Moivre (1667 — 1754), and\nPierre Simon Laplace are among those who made significant\ncontributions to this field.

The theoretical (classical) probability of an event E, written as P(E), is defined as\n\nNumber of outcomes favourable to E\n\nP(E\n&) Number of all possible outcomes of the experiment\n\nwhere we assume that the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely.\n2. The probability of a sure event (or certain event) is 1.\n3. The probability of an impossible event is 0.\n4. The probability of an event E is a number P(E) such that\nO<P(E)<1\n\n5. An event having only one outcome is called an elementary event. The sum of the\nprobabilities of all the elementary events of an experiment is 1.\n\n6. For any event E, P (E) + P(E) =1, where £ stands for ‘not E’. E and § are called\ncomplementary events.\n\nA NOTE TO THE READER\n\nThe experimental or empirical probability of an event is based on\nwhat has actually happened while the theoretical probability of the\n\nevent attempts to predict what will happen on the basis of certain\nassumptions. As the number of trials in an experiment, go on\nincreasing we may expect the experimental and theoretical\nprobabilities to be nearly the same.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",
