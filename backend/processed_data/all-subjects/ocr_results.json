It was\nbelieved that resources are free gifts of nature.\nAs a result, human beings used them\nindiscriminately and this has led to the\nfollowing major problems.\n\ne Depletion of resources for satisfying the\ngreed of a few individuals.\n\ne Accumulation ofresources in few hands, which,\nin turn, divided the society into two segments\ni.e. haves and have nots or rich and poor.\n\ne Indiscriminate exploitation of resources has\nled to global ecological crises such as, global\nwarming, ozone layer depletion, environmental\npollution and land degradation.\n\nActivity\n\n1. Imagine, if the oil supply gets exhausted\none day, how would this affect our life style?\n2. Plan a survey in your colony/village to |\ninvestigate people’s attitude towards\nrecycling of the domestic/agricultural\nwastes. Ask questions about :\n(a) What do they think about resources\nthey use?\n(b) What is their opinion about the |\nwastes, and its utilisation?\n(c) Collage your results.\n\nAn equitable distribution of resources has\nbecome essential for a sustained quality of life\nand global peace. If the present trend of\nresource depletion by a few individuals and\ncountries continues, the future of our planet\nis in danger.\n\nTherefore, resource planning is essential for\nsustainable existence of all forms of life.\nSustainable existence is a component of\nsustainable development.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\n(YA oO\n\neo\nSustainable development 4\n\nSustainable economic development means\n‘development should take place without\ndamaging the environment, and development\nin the present should not compromise with the\nneeds of the future generations.’\n\nRio de Janeiro Earth Summit, 1992\n\nIn June 1992, more than 100 heads of states\nmet in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, for the first\nInternational Earth Summit. The Summit was\nconvened for addressing urgent problems of\nenvironmental protection and socio-\neconomic development at the global level.\nThe assembled leaders signed the\nDeclaration on Global Climatic Change and\nBiological Diversity. The Rio Convention\nendorsed the global Forest Principles and\nadopted Agenda 21 for achieving\nSustainable Development in the 21* century.\n\nAgenda 21\n\nIt is the declaration signed by world leaders\nin 1992 at the United Nations Conference\non Environment and Development (UNCED),\nwhich took place at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It\naims at achieving global sustainable\ndevelopment. It is an agenda to combat\nenvironmental damage, poverty, disease\nthrough global co-operation on common\ninterests, mutual needs and shared\n- responsibilities. One major objective of the\n\nshould draw its own local Agenda 21.\n\n5 Agenda 21 is that every local government\n\nRESOURCE PLANNING\n\nPlanning is the widely accepted strategy for\njudicious use of resources. It has importance\nin a country like India, which has enormous\ndiversity in the availability of resources. There\nare regions which are rich in certain types of\nresources but are deficient in some other\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nresources. There are some regions which can\nbe considered self sufficient in terms of the\navailability of resources and there are some\nregions which have acute shortage of some vital\nresources. For example, the states of\nJharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya\nPradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits.\nArunachal Pradesh has abundance of water\nresources but lacks in infrastructural\ndevelopment. The state of Rajasthan is very well\nendowed with solar and wind energy but lacks\nin water resources. The cold desert of Ladakh\nis relatively isolated from the rest of the\ncountry. It has very rich cultural heritage but\nit is deficient in water, infrastructure and some\nvital minerals. This calls for balanced resource\nplanning at the national, state, regional and\nlocal levels.\n\nActivity\n\nPrepare a list of resources found in your state\nand also identify the resources that are\nimportant but deficit in your state.\n\nResource Planning in India\n\nResource planning is a complex process\nwhich involves : (i) identification and\ninventory of resources across the regions of\nthe country. This involves surveying,\nmapping and qualitative and quantitative\nestimation and measurement of the\nresources. (ii) Evolving a planning structure\nendowed with appropriate technology, skill\nand institutional set up for implementing\nresource development plans. (iii) Matching\nthe resource development plans with overall\nnational development plans.\n\nIndia has made concerted efforts for\nachieving the goals of resource planning right\nfrom the First Five Year Plan launched after\nIndependence.\n\nThe availability of resources is a necessary\ncondition for the development of any region,\nbut mere availability of resources in the\nabsence of corresponding changes in\n\nFind out\n\nWhat resources are being developed in your\nsurroundings by the community/village\npanchayats/ward level communities with the\nhelp of community participation?\n\ntechnology and institutions may hinder\ndevelopment. There are many regions in our\ncountry that are rich in resources but these\nare included in economically backward\nregions. On the contrary there are some regions\nwhich have a poor resource base but they are\neconomically developed.\n\nCan you name some resource rich but\neconomically backward regions and some\nresource poor but economically developed\nregions? Give reasons for such a situation.\n\nThe history of colonisation reveals that\nrich resources in colonies were the main\nattractions for the foreign invaders. It was\nprimarily the higher level of technological\ndevelopment of the colonising countries that\nhelped them to exploit resources of other\nregions and establish their supremacy over\nthe colonies. Therefore, resources can\ncontribute to development only when they are\naccompanied by appropriate technological\ndevelopment and institutional changes. India\nhas experienced all this in different phases of\ncolonisation. Therefore, in India, development,\nin general, and resource development in\nparticular does not only involve the\navailability of resources, but also the\ntechnology, quality of human resources and\nthe historical experiences of the people.\n\nConservation of Resources: Resources are\nvital for any developmental activity. But\nirrational consumption and over-utilisation\nof resources may lead to socio-economic and\nenvironmental problems. To overcome these\nproblems, resource conservation at various\nlevels is important. This had been the main\nconcern of the leaders and thinkers in the\npast. For example, Gandhiji was very apt in\nvoicing his concern about resource ~\nconservation in these words: “There is enough\n\nRESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nfor everybody’s need and not for any body’s\ngreed.” He placed the greedy and selfish\nindividuals and exploitative nature of modern\ntechnology as the root cause for resource\ndepletion at the global level. He was against\nmass production and wanted to replace it with\nthe production by the masses.\n\n]\n\nAt the international level, the Club of Rome \\\nadvocated resource conservation for the first —\ntime in a more systematic way in 1968.\nSubsequently, in 1974, Gandhian philosophy\nwas once again presented by Schumacher\nin his book Small is Beautiful. The seminal\ncontribution with respect to resource\nconservation at the global level was made\nby the Brundtland Commission Report, 1987.\nThis report introduced the concept of\n‘Sustainable Development’ and advocated\nit as a means for resource conservation,\nwhich was subsequently published in a book\nentitled Our Common Future. Another\n\nsignificant contribution was made at the Earth\nSummit at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992.\nLAND RESOURCES\n\nWe live on land, we perform our economic\nactivities on land and we use it in different\nways. Thus, land is a natural resource of\nutmost importance. It supports natural\nvegetation, wild life, human life, economic\nactivities, transport and communication\nsystems. However, land is an asset of a finite\nmagnitude, therefore, it is important to use the\n\n[] Plains\n[| Mountains\n\n[ ] Plateaus\n\n30%\n\nFig 1.3: India : Land under important Relief\nFeatures\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\navailable land for various purposes with careful\nplanning.\n\nIndia has land under a variety of relief\nfeatures, namely; mountains, plateaus, plains\nand islands. About 43 per cent of the land area\nis plain, which provides facilities for agriculture\nand industry. Mountains account for 30 per\ncent of the total surface area of the country and\nensure perennial flow of some rivers, provide\nfacilities for tourism and ecological aspects.\nAbout 27 per cent of the area of the country is\nthe plateau region. It possesses rich reserves\nof minerals, fossil fuels and forests.\n\nLanbD UTILISATION\n\nLand resources are used for the following\npurposes:\n\n1. Forests\n\n2. Land not available for cultivation\n(a) Barren and waste land\n(b) Land put to non-agricultural uses, e.g.\nbuildings, roads, factories, etc.\n3.

Land use data, however, is\navailable only for 93 per cent of the total\ngeographical area because the land use\nreporting for most of the north-east states\nexcept Assam has not been done fully.\nMoreover, some areas of Jammu and Kashmir\noccupied by Pakistan and China have also not\nbeen surveyed.\n\nActivity\nTry to do a comparison between the two pie\ncharts (Fig. 1.4 ) given for land use and find\nout why the net sown area and the land\nunder forests have changed from 1960-61\nto 2019-20 very marginally.\n\nThe land under permanent pasture has\nalso decreased.

Hence, these lands\nare cultivated once or twice in about two to\nthree years and if these are included in the\nnet sown area then the percentage of NSA in\nIndia comes to about 54 per cent of the total\nreporting area.\n\nThe pattern of net sown area varies greatly\nfrom one state to another.

A part\nof the land is termed as waste land and land\nput to other non-agricultural uses. Waste land\nincludes rocky, arid and desert areas and land\nput to other non-agricultural uses includes\nsettlements, roads, railways, industry etc.\nContinuous use of land over a long period of\ntime without taking appropriate measures to\nconserve and manage it, has resulted in land\ndegradation. This, in turn, has serious\nrepercussions on _ society and the\nenvironment.\n\nLAND DEGRADATION AND CONSERVATION\nMEASURES\n\nWe have shared our land with the past\ngenerations and will have to do so with the future\ngenerations too. Ninety-five per cent of our basic\nneeds for food, shelter and clothing are obtained\nfrom land. Human activities have not only\nbrought about degradation of land but have\nalso aggravated the pace of natural forces to\ncause damage to land.\n\nSome human activities such as\ndeforestation, over grazing, mining and\nquarrying too have contributed significantly in\nland degradation.\n\nMining sites are abandoned after\nexcavation work is complete leaving deep\nscars and traces of over-burdening. In states\nlike Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya\nPradesh and Odisha deforestation due to\nmining have caused severe land degradation.\nIn states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya\nPradesh and Maharashtra overgrazing is one\nof the main reasons for land degradation. In\nthe states of Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar\nPradesh, over irrigation is responsible for land\ndegradation due to water logging leading to\nincrease in salinity and alkalinity in the soil.\nThe mineral processing like grinding of\nlimestone for cement industry and calcite and\nsoapstone for ceramic industry generate huge\nquantity of dust in the atmosphere. It retards\nthe process of infiltration of water into the soil\nafter it settles down on the land. In recent\nyears, industrial effluents as waste have\nbecome a major source of land and water\npollution in many parts of the country.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nThere are many ways to solve the problems\nof land degradation. Afforestation and proper\nmanagement of grazing can help to some extent.\nPlanting of shelter belts of plants, control on\nover grazing, stabilisation of sand dunes by\ngrowing thorny bushes are some of the\nmethods to check land degradation in arid\nareas. Proper management of waste lands,\ncontrol of mining activities, proper discharge\nand disposal of industrial effluents and wastes\nafter treatment can reduce land and water\ndegradation in industrial and suburban areas.\n\nSor as A RESOURCE\n\nSoil is the most important renewable natural\nresource. It is the medium of plant growth\nand supports different types of living organisms\non the earth. The soil is a living system. It\ntakes millions of years to form soil upto a few\ncm in depth. Relief, parent rock or bed rock,\nclimate, vegetation and other forms of life and\ntime are important factors in the formation of\nsoil. Various forces of nature such as change\nin temperature, actions of running water, wind\nand glaciers, activities of decomposers etc.\ncontribute to the formation of soil. Chemical\nand organic changes which take place in the\n\n-\\ Unweathered  « A\n\\_/ «parent bed rock\noe Sa eee ah\nam ee > =~ § a Sed\n\nFig. 1.5: Soil Profile\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nsoil are equally important. Soil also consists\nof organic (humus) and inorganic materials\n(Fig. 1.5).\n\nOn the basis of the factors responsible for\nsoil formation, colour, thickness, texture, age,\nchemical and physical properties, the soils of\nIndia are classified in different types.\n\nClassification of Soils\n\nIndia has varied relief features, landforms,\nclimatic realms and vegetation types. These\nhave contributed in the development of various\ntypes of soils.\n\nAlluvial Soils\n\nThis is the most widely spread and important\nsoil. In fact, the entire northern plains are\nmade of alluvial soil. These have been\ndeposited by three important Himalayan river\nsystems- the Indus, the Ganga and the\nBrahmaputra. These soils also extend in\nRajasthan and Gujarat through a narrow\ncorridor. Alluvial soil is also found in the\n\neastern coastal plains particularly in the deltas\nof the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna\nand the Kaveri rivers.\n\nFig. 1.6: Alluvial Soil\n\nThe alluvial soil consists of various\nproportions of sand, silt and clay. As we move\ninlands towards the river valleys, soil particles\nappear some what bigger in size. In the upper\nreaches of the river valley i.e. near the place\nof the break of slope, the soils are coarse. Such\nsoils are more common in piedmont plains\nsuch as Duars, Chos and Terai.\n\nApart from the size of their grains or\ncomponents, soils are also described on the\nbasis of their age. According to their age\nalluvial soils can be classified as old alluvial\n(Bangar) and new alluvial (Khadar). The\nbangar soil has higher concentration of kanker\n\nnodules than the Khadar. It has more fine\nparticles and is more fertile than the bangar.\n\nAlluvial soils as a whole are very fertile.\nMostly these soils contain adequate proportion\nof potash, phosphoric acid and lime which\nare ideal for the growth of sugarcane, paddy,\nwheat and other cereal and pulse crops. Due\nto its high fertility, regions of alluvial soils are\nintensively cultivated and densely populated.\nSoils in the drier areas are more alkaline and\ncan be productive after proper treatment and\nirrigation.\n\nBlack Soil\n\nThese soils are black in colour and are also\nknown as regur soils. Black soil is ideal for\ngrowing cotton and is also known as black\ncotton soil. It is believed that climatic condition\nalong with the parent rock material are the\nimportant factors for the formation of black\nsoil. This type of soil is typical of the Deccan\ntrap (Basalt) region spread over northwest\nDeccan plateau and is made up of lava flows.\nThey cover the plateaus of Maharashtra,\nSaurashtra, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh and\nChhattisgarh and extend in the south east\ndirection along the Godavari and the Krishna\nvalleys.\n\nFig. 1.7: Black Soil\n\nThe black soils are made up of extremely\nfine i.e. clayey material. They are well-known\nfor their capacity to hold moisture. In addition,\n\nthey are rich in soil nutrients, such as calcium ¥\n\ncarbonate, magnesium, potash and lime.

Yellow\nand red soils are also found in parts of\nOdisha, Chhattisgarh, southern parts of the\nmiddle Ganga plain and along the piedmont\nzone of the Western Ghats. These soils develop\na reddish colour due to diffusion of iron in\ncrystalline and metamorphic rocks. It looks\nyellow when it occurs in a hydrated form.\n\nLaterite Soil\n\nLaterite has been derived from the Latin word\n‘later’ which means brick. The laterite soil\ndevelops under tropical and subtropical\nclimate with alternate wet and dry season.\nThis soil is the result of intense leaching due\nto heavy rain. Lateritic soils are mostly deep\nto very deep, acidic (pH<6.0), generally\ndeficient in plant nutrients and occur mostly\nin southern states, Western Ghats region of\nMaharashtra, Odisha, some parts of West\nBengal and North-east regions. Where these\nsoils support deciduous and evergreen\nforests, it is humus rich, but under sparse\n\nFig. 1.8: Laterite Soil\n\nvegetation and in semi-arid environment, it is\ngenerally humus poor. They are prone to\nerosion and degradation due to their position\non the landscape. After adopting appropriate\nsoil conservation techniques particularly in\nthe hilly areas of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil\nNadu, this soil is very useful for growing tea\nand coffee. Red laterite soils in Tamil Nadu,\nAndhra Pradesh and Kerala are more suitable\nfor crops like cashew nut.\n\nArid Soils\n\nArid soils range from red to brown in colour.\nThey are generally sandy in texture and saline\nin nature. In some areas the salt content is\nvery high and common salt is obtained by\nevaporating the water. Due to the dry climate,\nhigh temperature, evaporation is faster and\nthe soil lacks humus and moisture. The lower\nhorizons of the soil are occupied by Kankar\nbecause of the increasing calcium content\ndownwards. The Kankar layer formations in\nthe bottom horizons restrict the infiltration of\nwater. After proper irrigation these soils\nbecome cultivable as has been in the case of\nwestern Rajasthan.\n\nFig. 1.9: Arid Soil\n\nForest Soils\n\nThese soils are found in the hilly and\nmountainous areas where sufficient rain\nforests are available. The soils texture varies\naccording to the mountain environment\nwhere they are formed. They are loamy and\n\nsilty in valley sides and coarse grained in\n\nthe upper slopes. In the snow covered areas\n\nRESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nof Himalayas, these soils experience\ndenudation and are acidic with low humus\ncontent. The soils found in the lower parts of\nthe valleys particularly on the river terraces\nand alluvial fans are fertile.\n\nSoil Erosion and Soil Conservation\n\nThe denudation of the soil cover and\nsubsequent washing down is described as soil\nerosion. The processes of soil formation and\nerosion, go on simultaneously and generally\nthere is a balance between the two. Sometimes,\nthis balance is disturbed due to human\nactivities like deforestation, over-grazing,\nconstruction and mining etc., while natural\nforces like wind, glacier and water lead to\nsoil erosion. The running water cuts through\nthe clayey soils and makes deep channels as\ngullies. The land becomes unfit for cultivation\nand is known as bad land. In the Chambal\n\nbasin such lands are called ravines.\nSometimes water flows as a sheet over large\nareas down a slope. In such cases the top\n\nFig. 1.10: Soil Erosion\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig. 1.11: Gully Erosion\n\nsoil is washed away. This is known as sheet\nerosion. Wind blows loose soil off flat or\nsloping land known as wind erosion. Soil\nerosion is also caused due to defective methods\nof farming. Ploughing in a wrong way i.e. up\nand down the slope form channels for the\nquick flow of water leading to soil erosion.\n\nPloughing along the contour lines can\ndecelerate the flow of water down the slopes.\nThis is called contour ploughing. Steps can\nbe cut out on the slopes making terraces.\nTerrace cultivation restricts erosion. Western\nand central Himalayas have well developed\nterrace farming. Large fields can be divided into\nstrips. Strips of grass are left to grow between\nthe crops. This breaks up the force of the wind.\nThis method is known as strip cropping.\nPlanting lines of trees to create shelter also\nworks in a similar way. Rows of such trees are\ncalled shelter belts. These shelter belts have\ncontributed significantly to the stabilisation of\nsand dunes and in stabilising the desert in\nwestern India.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nExercises EXERCISES Exercises\n\n1.

There are some regions which can\nbe considered self sufficient in terms of the\navailability of resources and there are some\nregions which have acute shortage of some vital\nresources. For example, the states of\nJharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya\nPradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits.\nArunachal Pradesh has abundance of water\nresources but lacks in infrastructural\ndevelopment. The state of Rajasthan is very well\nendowed with solar and wind energy but lacks\nin water resources. The cold desert of Ladakh\nis relatively isolated from the rest of the\ncountry. It has very rich cultural heritage but\nit is deficient in water, infrastructure and some\nvital minerals. This calls for balanced resource\nplanning at the national, state, regional and\nlocal levels.\n\nActivity\n\nPrepare a list of resources found in your state\nand also identify the resources that are\nimportant but deficit in your state.\n\nResource Planning in India\n\nResource planning is a complex process\nwhich involves : (i) identification and\ninventory of resources across the regions of\nthe country. This involves surveying,\nmapping and qualitative and quantitative\nestimation and measurement of the\nresources. (ii) Evolving a planning structure\nendowed with appropriate technology, skill\nand institutional set up for implementing\nresource development plans. (iii) Matching\nthe resource development plans with overall\nnational development plans.\n\nIndia has made concerted efforts for\nachieving the goals of resource planning right\nfrom the First Five Year Plan launched after\nIndependence.\n\nThe availability of resources is a necessary\ncondition for the development of any region,\nbut mere availability of resources in the\nabsence of corresponding changes in\n\nFind out\n\nWhat resources are being developed in your\nsurroundings by the community/village\npanchayats/ward level communities with the\nhelp of community participation?\n\ntechnology and institutions may hinder\ndevelopment. There are many regions in our\ncountry that are rich in resources but these\nare included in economically backward\nregions. On the contrary there are some regions\nwhich have a poor resource base but they are\neconomically developed.\n\nCan you name some resource rich but\neconomically backward regions and some\nresource poor but economically developed\nregions? Give reasons for such a situation.\n\nThe history of colonisation reveals that\nrich resources in colonies were the main\nattractions for the foreign invaders. It was\nprimarily the higher level of technological\ndevelopment of the colonising countries that\nhelped them to exploit resources of other\nregions and establish their supremacy over\nthe colonies. Therefore, resources can\ncontribute to development only when they are\naccompanied by appropriate technological\ndevelopment and institutional changes. India\nhas experienced all this in different phases of\ncolonisation. Therefore, in India, development,\nin general, and resource development in\nparticular does not only involve the\navailability of resources, but also the\ntechnology, quality of human resources and\nthe historical experiences of the people.\n\nConservation of Resources: Resources are\nvital for any developmental activity. But\nirrational consumption and over-utilisation\nof resources may lead to socio-economic and\nenvironmental problems. To overcome these\nproblems, resource conservation at various\nlevels is important. This had been the main\nconcern of the leaders and thinkers in the\npast.

Waste land\nincludes rocky, arid and desert areas and land\nput to other non-agricultural uses includes\nsettlements, roads, railways, industry etc.\nContinuous use of land over a long period of\ntime without taking appropriate measures to\nconserve and manage it, has resulted in land\ndegradation. This, in turn, has serious\nrepercussions on _ society and the\nenvironment.\n\nLAND DEGRADATION AND CONSERVATION\nMEASURES\n\nWe have shared our land with the past\ngenerations and will have to do so with the future\ngenerations too. Ninety-five per cent of our basic\nneeds for food, shelter and clothing are obtained\nfrom land. Human activities have not only\nbrought about degradation of land but have\nalso aggravated the pace of natural forces to\ncause damage to land.\n\nSome human activities such as\ndeforestation, over grazing, mining and\nquarrying too have contributed significantly in\nland degradation.\n\nMining sites are abandoned after\nexcavation work is complete leaving deep\nscars and traces of over-burdening. In states\nlike Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya\nPradesh and Odisha deforestation due to\nmining have caused severe land degradation.\nIn states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya\nPradesh and Maharashtra overgrazing is one\nof the main reasons for land degradation. In\nthe states of Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar\nPradesh, over irrigation is responsible for land\ndegradation due to water logging leading to\nincrease in salinity and alkalinity in the soil.\nThe mineral processing like grinding of\nlimestone for cement industry and calcite and\nsoapstone for ceramic industry generate huge\nquantity of dust in the atmosphere. It retards\nthe process of infiltration of water into the soil\nafter it settles down on the land. In recent\nyears, industrial effluents as waste have\nbecome a major source of land and water\npollution in many parts of the country.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nThere are many ways to solve the problems\nof land degradation. Afforestation and proper\nmanagement of grazing can help to some extent.\nPlanting of shelter belts of plants, control on\nover grazing, stabilisation of sand dunes by\ngrowing thorny bushes are some of the\nmethods to check land degradation in arid\nareas. Proper management of waste lands,\ncontrol of mining activities, proper discharge\nand disposal of industrial effluents and wastes\nafter treatment can reduce land and water\ndegradation in industrial and suburban areas.\n\nSor as A RESOURCE\n\nSoil is the most important renewable natural\nresource.

Soil also consists\nof organic (humus) and inorganic materials\n(Fig. 1.5).\n\nOn the basis of the factors responsible for\nsoil formation, colour, thickness, texture, age,\nchemical and physical properties, the soils of\nIndia are classified in different types.\n\nClassification of Soils\n\nIndia has varied relief features, landforms,\nclimatic realms and vegetation types. These\nhave contributed in the development of various\ntypes of soils.\n\nAlluvial Soils\n\nThis is the most widely spread and important\nsoil. In fact, the entire northern plains are\nmade of alluvial soil. These have been\ndeposited by three important Himalayan river\nsystems- the Indus, the Ganga and the\nBrahmaputra. These soils also extend in\nRajasthan and Gujarat through a narrow\ncorridor. Alluvial soil is also found in the\n\neastern coastal plains particularly in the deltas\nof the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna\nand the Kaveri rivers.\n\nFig. 1.6: Alluvial Soil\n\nThe alluvial soil consists of various\nproportions of sand, silt and clay. As we move\ninlands towards the river valleys, soil particles\nappear some what bigger in size. In the upper\nreaches of the river valley i.e. near the place\nof the break of slope, the soils are coarse. Such\nsoils are more common in piedmont plains\nsuch as Duars, Chos and Terai.\n\nApart from the size of their grains or\ncomponents, soils are also described on the\nbasis of their age. According to their age\nalluvial soils can be classified as old alluvial\n(Bangar) and new alluvial (Khadar). The\nbangar soil has higher concentration of kanker\n\nnodules than the Khadar. It has more fine\nparticles and is more fertile than the bangar.\n\nAlluvial soils as a whole are very fertile.\nMostly these soils contain adequate proportion\nof potash, phosphoric acid and lime which\nare ideal for the growth of sugarcane, paddy,\nwheat and other cereal and pulse crops. Due\nto its high fertility, regions of alluvial soils are\nintensively cultivated and densely populated.\nSoils in the drier areas are more alkaline and\ncan be productive after proper treatment and\nirrigation.\n\nBlack Soil\n\nThese soils are black in colour and are also\nknown as regur soils. Black soil is ideal for\ngrowing cotton and is also known as black\ncotton soil. It is believed that climatic condition\nalong with the parent rock material are the\nimportant factors for the formation of black\nsoil. This type of soil is typical of the Deccan\ntrap (Basalt) region spread over northwest\nDeccan plateau and is made up of lava flows.\nThey cover the plateaus of Maharashtra,\nSaurashtra, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh and\nChhattisgarh and extend in the south east\ndirection along the Godavari and the Krishna\nvalleys.\n\nFig. 1.7: Black Soil\n\nThe black soils are made up of extremely\nfine i.e. clayey material. They are well-known\nfor their capacity to hold moisture. In addition,\n\nthey are rich in soil nutrients, such as calcium ¥\n\ncarbonate, magnesium, potash and lime.

Yellow\nand red soils are also found in parts of\nOdisha, Chhattisgarh, southern parts of the\nmiddle Ganga plain and along the piedmont\nzone of the Western Ghats. These soils develop\na reddish colour due to diffusion of iron in\ncrystalline and metamorphic rocks.

The laterite soil\ndevelops under tropical and subtropical\nclimate with alternate wet and dry season.\nThis soil is the result of intense leaching due\nto heavy rain. Lateritic soils are mostly deep\nto very deep, acidic (pH<6.0), generally\ndeficient in plant nutrients and occur mostly\nin southern states, Western Ghats region of\nMaharashtra, Odisha, some parts of West\nBengal and North-east regions.

They are prone to\nerosion and degradation due to their position\non the landscape. After adopting appropriate\nsoil conservation techniques particularly in\nthe hilly areas of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil\nNadu, this soil is very useful for growing tea\nand coffee. Red laterite soils in Tamil Nadu,\nAndhra Pradesh and Kerala are more suitable\nfor crops like cashew nut.\n\nArid Soils\n\nArid soils range from red to brown in colour.\nThey are generally sandy in texture and saline\nin nature. In some areas the salt content is\nvery high and common salt is obtained by\nevaporating the water. Due to the dry climate,\nhigh temperature, evaporation is faster and\nthe soil lacks humus and moisture. The lower\nhorizons of the soil are occupied by Kankar\nbecause of the increasing calcium content\ndownwards. The Kankar layer formations in\nthe bottom horizons restrict the infiltration of\nwater.

The processes of soil formation and\nerosion, go on simultaneously and generally\nthere is a balance between the two. Sometimes,\nthis balance is disturbed due to human\nactivities like deforestation, over-grazing,\nconstruction and mining etc., while natural\nforces like wind, glacier and water lead to\nsoil erosion.

In such cases the top\n\nFig. 1.10: Soil Erosion\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig. 1.11: Gully Erosion\n\nsoil is washed away. This is known as sheet\nerosion. Wind blows loose soil off flat or\nsloping land known as wind erosion. Soil\nerosion is also caused due to defective methods\nof farming. Ploughing in a wrong way i.e. up\nand down the slope form channels for the\nquick flow of water leading to soil erosion.\n\nPloughing along the contour lines can\ndecelerate the flow of water down the slopes.\nThis is called contour ploughing. Steps can\nbe cut out on the slopes making terraces.\nTerrace cultivation restricts erosion. Western\nand central Himalayas have well developed\nterrace farming. Large fields can be divided into\nstrips. Strips of grass are left to grow between\nthe crops. This breaks up the force of the wind.\nThis method is known as strip cropping.\nPlanting lines of trees to create shelter also\nworks in a similar way. Rows of such trees are\ncalled shelter belts.

It also preserves the genetic diversity of\nplants and animals for better growth of species\nand breeding. For example, in agriculture,\nwe are still dependent on traditional crop\nvarieties. Fisheries too are heavily dependent\non the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, conservationists\ndemanded a national wildlife protection\nprogramme.

An all-\nIndia list of protected species was also\npublished. The thrust of the programme was\ntowards protecting the remaining population\nof certain endangered species by banning\nhunting, giving legal protection to their\nhabitats, and restricting trade in wildlife.\nSubsequently, central and many state\ngovernments established national parks and\nwildlife sanctuaries about which you have\nalready studied. The central government also\nannounced several projects for protecting\nspecific animals, which were gravely\nthreatened, including the tiger, the one-\nhorned rhinoceros, the Kashmir stag or\nhangul, three types of crocodiles — fresh\nwater crocodile, saltwater crocodile and the\nGharial, the Asiatic lion, and others. Most\nrecently, the Indian elephant, black buck\n(chinkara), the great Indian bustard\n(godawan) and the snow leopard, etc. have\n\n~ been given full or partial legal protection\n\n{wv against hunting and trade throughout India.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\ntd\nProject Tiger\nTiger is one of the key wildlife species in\n\nthe faunal web. In 1973, the authorities\nrealised that the tiger population had\ndwindled to 1,827 from an estimated\n55,000 at the turn of the century. The major\nthreats to tiger population are numerous,\nsuch as poaching for trade, shrinking\nhabitat, depletion of prey base species,\ngrowing human population, etc. The trade\nof tiger skins and the use of their bones in\ntraditional medicines, especially in the\nAsian countries left the tiger population on\nthe verge of extinction. Since India and\nNepal provide habitat to about two-thirds\nof the surviving tiger population in the\nworld, these two nations became prime\ntargets for poaching and illegal trading.\n“Project Tiger”, one of the well-\npublicised wildlife campaigns in the world,\nwas launched in 1973. Tiger conservation\nhas been viewed not only as an effort to\nsave an endangered species, but with\n\n\n\nFig. 2.2: Rhino and deer in Kaziranga National Park\n\nequal importance as a means of\npreserving biotypes of sizeable magnitude.\nCorbett National Park in Uttarakhand,\nSunderbans National Park in West Bengal,\nBandhavgarh National Park in Madhya\nPradesh, Sariska Wildlife Sanctuary in\nRajasthan, Manas Tiger Reserve in Assam\n\ne . . .\nand Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala are\n} some of the tiger reserves of India.\n\nThe conservation projects are now focusing\non biodiversity rather than on a few of its\ncomponents. There is now a more intensive\nsearch for different conservation measures.\nIncreasingly, even insects are beginning to find\na place in conservation planning. In the\nnotification under Wildlife Act of 1980 and\n1986, several hundred butterflies, moths,\nbeetles, and one dragonfly have been added to\nthe list of protected species. In 1991, for the\nfirst time plants were also added to the list,\nstarting with six species.\n\n- Activity\nCollect more information on the wildlife\nsanctuaries and national parks of India and\ncite their locations on the map of India.\n\nTypes and Distribution of Forest and\nWildlife Resources\n\nEven if we want to conserve our vast forest and\nwildlife resources, it is rather difficult to\nmanage, control and regulate them. In India,\n\nmuch of its forest and wildlife resources are\neither owned or managed by the government\nthrough the Forest Department or other\ngovernment departments. These are classified\nunder the following categories.\n\n(j) Reserved Forests: More than half of the\ntotal forest land has been declared\nreserved forests. Reserved forests are\nregarded as the most valuable as far as the\nconservation of forest and wildlife resources\nare concerned.\n\n(ii) Protected Forests: Almost one-third of the\ntotal forest area is protected forest, as\ndeclared by the Forest Department. This\nforest land are protected from any further\ndepletion.\n\n(iii) Unclassed Forests: These are other\nforests and wastelands belonging to\nboth government and private individuals\nand communities.\n\nReserved and protected forests are also\nreferred to as permanent forest estates\nmaintained for the purpose of producing\ntimber and other forest produce, and for\nprotective reasons. Madhya Pradesh has the\nlargest area under permanent forests,\nconstituting 75 per cent of its total forest area.\nJammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh,\nUttarakhand, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West\nBengal, and Maharashtra have large\npercentages of reserved forests of its total forest\narea whereas Bihar, Haryana, Punjab, |\nHimachal Pradesh, Odisha and Rajasthan have\n\na bulk of it under protected forests.

We often ignore that in India, forests\nare also home to some of the traditional\ncommunities. In some areas of India, local\ncommunities are struggling to conserve these\nhabitats along with government officials,\nrecognising that only this will secure their\nown long-term livelihood. In Sariska Tiger\nReserve, Rajasthan, villagers have fought\nagainst mining by citing the Wildlife Protection\nAct. In many areas, villagers themselves are\nprotecting habitats and explicitly rejecting\ngovernment involvement. The inhabitants of\nfive villages in the Alwar district of Rajasthan\nwy have declared 1,200 hectares of forest as the\nyw Bhairodev Dakav ‘Sonchuri’, declaring their\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nown set of rules and regulations which do not\nallow hunting, and are protecting the wildlife\nagainst any outside encroachments.\n\nThe famous Chipko movement in the\nHimalayas has not only successfully resisted\ndeforestation in several areas but has also\nshown that community afforestation with\nindigenous species can be enormously\nsuccessful. Attempts to revive the traditional\nconservation methods or developing new\nmethods of ecological farming are now\nwidespread. Farmers and citizen’s groups like\nthe Beej Bachao Andolan in Tehri and\nNavdanya have shown that adequate levels of\ndiversified crop production without the use of\nsynthetic chemicals are possible and\neconomically viable.\n\nIn India joint forest management (JFM)\nprogramme furnishes a good example for\ninvolving local communities in the\nmanagement and restoration of degraded\n\n\n\n®\nSacred groves - a wealth of diverse and rare\n\nspecies\n\nNature worship is an age old tribal belief based on\nthe premise that all creations of nature have to be\nprotected. Such beliefs have preserved several virgin\nforests in pristine form called Sacred Groves (the\nforests of God and Goddesses). These patches of\nforest or parts of large forests have been left\nuntouched by the local people and any interference\nwith them is banned.\n\nCertain societies revere a particular tree which\nthey have preserved from time immemorial. The\nMundas and the Santhal of Chota Nagpur region\nworship mahua (Bassia latifolia) and kadamba\n(Anthocaphalus cadamba) trees, and the tribals of\nOdisha and Bihar worship the tamarind (Tamarindus\nindica) and mango (Mangijfera indica) trees during\nweddings. To many of us, peepal and banyan trees\nare considered sacred.\n\nIndian society comprises several cultures, each\nwith its own set of traditional methods of conserving\nnature and its creations. Sacred qualities are often\nascribed to springs, mountain peaks, plants and\nanimals which are closely protected. You will find\ntroops of macaques and langurs around many\ntemples. They are fed daily and treated as a part of\ntemple devotees.

The programme has been in formal\nexistence since 1988 when the state of\nOdisha passed the first resolution for joint\nforest management.

In return, the members of\nthese communities are entitled to\nintermediary benefits like non-timber\nforest produces and share in the timber\nharvested by ‘successful protection’.\n\nThe clear lesson from the dynamics of\nboth environmental destruction and\nreconstruction in India is that local\ncommunities everywhere have to be\ninvolved in some kind of natural resource\nmanagement. But there is still a long way\nto go before local communities are at the\ncentre-stage in decision-making.

What\n\nYou already know that three-fourth of the\nearth’s surface is covered with water, but only\na small proportion of it accounts for\nfreshwater that can be put to use. This\nfreshwater is mainly obtained from surface\nrun off and ground water that is continually\nbeing renewed and recharged through the\nhydrological cycle. All water moves within the\nhydrological cycle ensuring that water is a\nrenewable resource.\n\nYou might wonder that if three-fourth of\nthe world is covered with water and water is\na renewable resource, then how is it that\ncountries and regions around the globe suffer\nfrom water scarcity? Why is it predicted that\nby 2025, nearly two billion people will live in\nabsolute water scarcity?\n\nhavoc they have created it has destroyed and\nswept away everything in its path.\n\nYes, Chintu, I did. Isn't it strange that\nwater can give life and take life as well.\nWhat would we do without water?\n\nWe need water to drink, cook our\nfood, wash our clothes and wash\nourselves as well. My father was\ntelling me that in his factory they\nneed a lot of water for a number of\nthings. Did you know that they even\nneed water for cooling the machines?\nIn fact, the factory runs on the power supplied by the\nhydel power plant. Now, I can understand why\nthrough the ages we humans have chosen to live\n\nnear water courses along the rivers and other water\nsources like springs, lakes, ponds and oases.\n\nWATER SCARCITY AND THE NEED FOR WATER\nCONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT\n\nGiven the abundance and renewability of\nwater, it is difficult to imagine that we may\nsuffer from water scarcity. The moment we\nspeak of water shortages, we immediately\nassociate it with regions having low rainfall\nor those that are drought prone. We\ninstantaneously visualise the deserts of\nRajasthan and women balancing many\n‘matkas’ (earthen pots) used for collecting\nand storing water and travelling long\ndistances to get water. True, the availability\nof water resources varies over space and time,\nmainly due to the variations in seasonal and\nannual precipitation, but water scarcity in\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nmost cases is caused by over-exploitation,\nexcessive use and unequal access to water\namong different social groups.\n\nWhere is then water scarcity likely to\noccur? As you have read in the hydrological\ncycle, freshwater can be obtained directly\nfrom precipitation, surface run off and\ngroundwater.\n\nIs it possible that an area or region may\nhave ample water resources but is still facing\nwater scarcity? Many of our cities are such\nexamples. Thus, water scarcity may be an\noutcome of large and growing population and\n\nconsequent greater demands for water, and\nunequal access to it. A large population\nrequires more water not only for domestic\nuse but also to produce more food. Hence, to\nfacilitate higher food-grain production, water\nresources are being over-exploited to expand\nirrigated areas for dry-season agriculture.\nIrrigated agriculture is the largest consumer\nof water. Now it is needed to revolutionise the\nagriculture through developing drought\nresistant crops and dry farming techniques.\nYou may have seen in many television\nadvertisements that most farmers have their\n\nUe sit Sasa WA 25 Veh. sitaa artis aat are eer AW ae ar ats\nare Tet F at Ga site 114 Set, sitea anfttee aut are eat Sor\nufa aed fenet srr Y qar saya User Fi Ser A ser at Sacrerar siz\nWAR ST H arya BAfad Hears + BA a aA Ht aat sr se\nadl-arelt & asit @ agent ay F aen are & rae sat SH are\nerrern At Tet aor HH fore Ure ant apett SH era Fi A et yer areor Fer\n\nWater, Water Everywhere, Not a Drop to Drink:\nAfter a heavy downpour, a boy collects drinking\nwater in Kolkata.

But have\nyou ever wondered what this could result in?\nThat it may lead to falling groundwater levels,\nadversely affecting water availability and food\nsecurity of the people.\n\nPost-independent India witnessed\nintensive industrialisation and urbanisation,\ncreating vast opportunities for us. Today, large\nindustrial houses are as commonplace as the\nindustrial units of many MNCs (Multinational\nCorporations). The ever-increasing number of\nindustries has made matters worse by exerting\npressure on existing freshwater resources.\nIndustries, apart from being heavy users of\nwater, also require power to run them. Much\nof this energy comes from hydroelectric power.\nMoreover, multiplying urban centres with\nlarge and dense populations and urban\nlifestyles have not only added to water and\nenergy requirements but have further\naggravated the problem. If you look into the\nhousing societies or colonies in the cities, you\nwould find that most of these have their own\ngroundwater pumping devices to meet their\nwater needs. Not surprisingly, we find that\nfragile water resources are being over-\nexploited and have caused their depletion in\nseveral of these cities.\n\nDo you know?\n\nAtal Bhujal Yojana (Atal Jal) is being\nimplemented in 8220 water stressed Gram\nPanchayats of 229 administrative blocks /\ntalukas in 80 districts of seven states, viz.\nGujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya\nPradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and\nUttar Pradesh. The selected States account\nfor about 37 per cent of the total number\nof water— stressed (over-exploited, critical\nand semi-critical) blocks in India. One of\nthe key aspects of Atal Jal is to bring in\nbehavioural changes in the community,\nfrom the prevailing attitude of\nconsumption to conservation and smart\nwater management.\n\nSource: Annual Report, Ministry of Jal Shakti,\nGovernment of India 2022-23\n\nSo far we have focused on the quantitative\naspects of water scarcity. Now, let us consider\nanother situation where water is sufficiently\n\navailable to meet the needs of the people, but,\nthe area still suffers from water scarcity. This\nscarcity may be due to bad quality of water.\nLately, there has been a growing concern that\neven if there is ample water to meet the needs\nof the people, much of it may be polluted by\ndomestic and industrial wastes, chemicals,\npesticides and fertilisers used in agriculture,\nthus, making it hazardous for human use.\nGovernment of India has accorded highest\npriority to improve the quality of life and\nenhance ease of living of people especially those\nliving in rual areas by announcing the Jal\nJeevan Mission (JJM). The Goal of JJM is to\nenable every rural household get assured\nsupply of potable piped water at a service level\nof 55 litres per capita per day regularly on\nlong-term basis by ensuring functionality of\nthe tap water connections. (Source: Economic\nSurvey 2020-21, p.357)\n\nYou may have already realised that the need\nof the hour is to conserve and manage our\nwater resources, to safeguard ourselves from\nhealth hazards, to ensure food security,\ncontinuation of our livelihoods and productive\nactivities and also to prevent degradation of our\nnatural ecosystems. Over exploitation and\nmismanagement of water resources will\nimpoverish this resource and cause ecological\ncrisis that may have profound impact on\nour lives.\n\nActivity\nFrom your everyday experiences, write a short\nproposal on how you can conserve water.\n\nMULTI-PURPOSE RIVER PROJECTS AND\nINTEGRATED WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT\n\nBut, how do we conserve and manage water?\nArchaeological and historical records show\nthat from ancient times we have been\nconstructing sophisticated hydraulic\nstructures like dams built of stone rubble,\nreservoirs or lakes, embankments and canals\nfor irrigation.

Dams also fragment rivers making it\ndifficult for aquatic fauna to migrate, especially\nfor spawning. The reservoirs that are created\non the floodplains also submerge the existing\nvegetation and soil leading to its\ndecomposition over a period of time.\n\nDo you know?\n\nSardar Sarovar Dam has been built over\nthe Narmada River in Gujarat.

In\nancient India, along with the sophisticated\nhydraulic structures, there existed an\nextraordinary tradition of water-harvesting\nsystem. People had in-depth knowledge of\nrainfall regimes and soil types and developed\nwide ranging techniques to harvest\nrainwater, groundwater, river water and flood\nwater in keeping with the local ecological\nconditions and their water needs. In hill and\nmountainous regions, people built diversion\nchannels like the ‘guls’ or ‘kuls’ of the\nWestern Himalayas for agriculture. ‘Rooftop\nrainwater harvesting’ was commonly\n\nBasic Safety Precautions To Be Taken :\n\npractised to store drinking water,\nparticularly in Rajasthan. In the flood plains\nof Bengal, people developed inundation\nchannels to irrigate their fields. In arid and\nsemi-arid regions, agricultural fields were\nconverted into rain fed storage structures\nthat allowed the water to stand and moisten\nthe soil like the ‘khadins’ in Jaisalmer and\n‘JJohads’ in other parts of Rajasthan.\n\nIn the semi-arid and arid regions of\nRajasthan, particularly in Bikaner, Phalodi\nand Barmer, almost all the houses\ntraditionally had underground tanks or\ntankas for storing drinking water. The tanks\ncould be as large as a big room; one\nhousehold in Phalodi had a tank that was\n6.1 metres deep, 4.27 metres long and 2.44\nmetres wide.

It is interesting because\nCherapunjee and Mawsynram situated\nat a distance of 55 km. from Shillong\nreceive the highest rainfall in the world,\nyet the state capital Shillong faces acute\nshortage of water. Nearly every\nhousehold in the city has a rooftop\nrainwater harvesting structure. Nearly\n15-25 per cent of the total water\nrequirement of the household comes\nfrom rooftop water harvesting.\n\nActivity\nFind out other rainwater harvesting systems\nexisting in and around your locality.\n\nroom cool.\n\nToday, in western Rajasthan, sadly the\npractice of rooftop rainwater harvesting is on\nthe decline as plenty of water is available due\nto the perennial Indira Gandhi Canal, though\nsome houses still maintain the tankas since\nthey do not like the taste of tap water.\nFortunately, in many parts of rural and urban\nIndia, rooftop rainwater harvesting is being\nsuccessfully adapted to store and conserve\nwater. In Gendathur, a remote backward\nvillage in Mysuru, Karnataka, villagers have\ninstalled, in their household’s rooftop,\nrainwater harvesting system to meet their\nwater needs. Nearly 200 households have\ninstalled this system and the village has earned\nthe rare distinction of being rich in rainwater.\nSee Fig. 3.6 for a better understanding of the\nrooftop rainwater harvesting system which is\n\nadapted here. Gendathur receives an annual\nprecipitation of 1,000 mm, and with 80 per\ncent of collection efficiency and of about 10\nfillings, every house can collect and use about\n50,000 litres of water annually. From the 200\nhouses, the net amount of rainwater harvested\nannually amounts to 1,00,000 litres.\n\nRooftop harvesting was common across the towns\nand villages of the Thar. Rainwater that falls on\nthe sloping roofs of houses is taken through a\npipe into an underground tanka (circular holes in\nthe ground). built in the main house or in the\ncourtyard. The picture above shows water being\n\ntaken from a neighbour’s roof through a long pipe.\n\nHere the neighbour’s rooftop has been used for\ncollection of rainwater. The picture shows a hole\nthrough which rainwater flows down into an\nunderground tanka.\n\nFig. 3.6\n\n@\n\nInteresting Fact\n\nTamil Nadu is the first state in India\nwhich has made rooftop rainwater\nharvesting structure compulsory to all\nthe houses across the state.

In Gendathur, a remote backward\nvillage in Mysuru, Karnataka, villagers have\ninstalled, in their household’s rooftop,\nrainwater harvesting system to meet their\nwater needs. Nearly 200 households have\ninstalled this system and the village has earned\nthe rare distinction of being rich in rainwater.\nSee Fig. 3.6 for a better understanding of the\nrooftop rainwater harvesting system which is\n\nadapted here.

From the 200\nhouses, the net amount of rainwater harvested\nannually amounts to 1,00,000 litres.\n\nRooftop harvesting was common across the towns\nand villages of the Thar. Rainwater that falls on\nthe sloping roofs of houses is taken through a\npipe into an underground tanka (circular holes in\nthe ground). built in the main house or in the\ncourtyard.

Over these years, cultivation\nmethods have changed significantly depending\nupon the characteristics of physical\nenvironment, technological know-how and\nsocio-cultural practices. Farming varies from\nsubsistence to commercial type. At present,\nin different parts of India, the following\nfarming systems are practised.\n\nPrimitive Subsistence Farming\n\nThis type of farming is still practised in few\npockets of India. Primitive subsistence\nagriculture is practised on small patches of\nland with the help of primitive tools like hoe,\ndao and digging sticks, and family/\ncommunity labour. This type of farming\ndepends upon monsoon, natural fertility of\nthe soil and suitability of other environmental\nconditions to the crops grown.\n\nIt is a ‘slash and burn’ agriculture.\nFarmers clear a patch of land and produce\ncereals and other food crops to sustain their\nfamily. When the soil fertility decreases, the\nfarmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land\nfor cultivation. This type of shifting allows\nNature to replenish the fertility of the soil\n\nthrough natural processes; land productivity\nin this type of agriculture is low as the farmer\ndoes not use fertilisers or other modern\n\ninputs. It is known by different names in\ndifferent parts of the country.\n\nCan you name some such types of farmings?\n\nIt is jhumming in north-eastern states like\nAssam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland;\nPamlou in Manipur, Dipa in Bastar district\nof Chhattishgarh, and in Andaman and\n\nNicobar Islands.\n8\n\nJhumming: The ‘slash and burn’ agriculture\nis known as ‘Milpa’ in Mexico and Central\nAmerica, ‘Conuco’ in Venzuela, ‘Roca’ in\nBrazil, ‘Masole’ in Central Africa, ‘Ladang’\nin Indonesia, ‘Ray’ in Vietnam.\n\nIn India, this primitive form of cultivation\nis called ‘Bewar’ or ‘Dahiya’ in Madhya\nPradesh, ‘Podu’ or ‘Penda’ in Andhra Pradesh,\n‘Pama Dabi’ or ‘Koman’ or Bringa’ in Odisha,\n‘Kumari’ in Western Ghats, ‘Valre’ or ‘Waltre’\nin South-eastern Rajasthan, ‘Khil’ in the\nHimalayan belt, ‘Kuruwa’ in Jharkhand, and\nJhumming’ in the North-eastern region.\n\naa\npies &\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\ne—,\nRinjha lived with her family in a small village\n\nat the outskirts of Diphu in Assam. She enjoys \\\nwatching her family members clearing, ~\nslashing and burning a patch of land for\ncultivation. She often helps them in irrigating\nthe fields with water running through a\nbamboo canal from the nearby spring. She\nloves the surroundings and wants to stay\nhere as long as she can, but this little girl\ne has no idea about the declining fertility of\n© the soil and her family’s search for fresh a\ny patch of land in the next season.\n\nCan you name the type of farming Rinjha’s\nfamily is engaged in?\n\nCan you enlist some crops which are grown\nin such farming?\n\nIntensive Subsistence Farming\n\nThis type of farming is practised in areas of\nhigh population pressure on land. It is labour-\nintensive farming, where high doses of\nbiochemical inputs and irrigation are used\nfor obtaining higher production.\n\nCan you name some of the states of India\nwhere such farming is practised?\n\nThough the ‘right of inheritance’ leading\nto the division of land among successive\ngenerations has rendered land-holding size\nuneconomical, the farmers continue to take\nmaximum output from the limited land in\nthe absence of alternative source of livelihood.\nThus, there is enormous pressure on\nagricultural land.\n\nCommercial Farming\n\nThe main characteristic of this type of farming\nis the use of higher doses of modern inputs,\ne.g. high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, chemical\nfertilisers, insecticides and pesticides in order\nto obtain higher productivity. The degree of\ncommercialisation of agriculture varies from\none region to another. For example, rice is a\ncommercial crop in Haryana and Punjab, but\nin Odisha, it is a subsistence crop.\n\nCan you give some more examples of crops\nwhich may be commercial in one region and\nmay provide subsistence in another region?\n\nPlantation is also a type of commercial\nfarming. In this type of farming, a single crop\nis grown on a large area. The plantation has\nan interface of agriculture and industry.\nPlantations cover large tracts of land, using\ncapital intensive inputs, with the help of\nmigrant labourers. All the produce is used\nas raw material in respective industries.\n\nIn India, tea, coffee, rubber, sugarcane,\nbanana, etc., are important plantation crops.\nTea in Assam and North Bengal coffee in\nKarnataka are some of the important\nplantation crops grown in these states. Since\nthe production is mainly for market, a well-\ndeveloped network of transport and\ncommunication connecting the plantation\nareas, processing industries and markets\nplays an important role in the development\nof plantations.\n\nReo 5e we pie Pa ks a5 aed\nirae “yee tS oe oe\n\nFig. 4.2: Banana plantation in Southern\npart of India\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nCRopPING PATTERN\n\nYou have studied the physical diversities and\nplurality of cultures in India. These are also\nreflected in agricultural practices and\ncropping patterns in the country. Various\ntypes of food and fibre crops, vegetables and\nfruits, spices and condiments, etc. constitute\nsome of the important crops grown in the\ncountry. India has three cropping seasons\n— rabi, kharif and zaid.\n\nRabi crops are sown in winter from October\nto December and harvested in summer from\nApril to June. Some of the important rabi\ncrops are wheat, barley, peas, gram and\nmustard. Though, these crops are grown in\nlarge parts of India, states from the north\nand north-western parts such as Punjab,\nHaryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and\nKashmir, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are\nimportant for the production of wheat and\nother rabi crops. Availability of precipitation\nduring winter months due to the western\ntemperate cyclones helps in the success of\nthese crops. However, the success of the green\nrevolution in Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar\nPradesh and parts of Rajasthan has also been\nan important factor in the growth of the above-\nmentioned rabi crops.\n\nKharif crops are grown with the onset of\nmonsoon in different parts of the country and\nthese are harvested in September-October.\nImportant crops grown during this season\nare paddy, maize, jowar, bajra, tur (arhar),\nmoong, urad, cotton, jute, groundnut and\nsoyabean. Some of the most important rice-\ngrowing regions are Assam, West Bengal,\ncoastal regions of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh,\nTelangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and\nMaharashtra, particularly the (Konkan coast)\nalong with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Recently,\npaddy has also become an important crop of\nPunjab and Haryana. In states like Assam,\nWest Bengal and Odisha, three crops of paddy\nare grown in a year. These are Aus, Aman\nand Boro.\n\n| In between the rabi and the kharif seasons,\n‘there is a short season during the summer\nmonths known as the Zaid season. Some of\nthe crops produced during ‘zaid’ are\n\nCN CONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nwatermelon, muskmelon, cucumber,\nvegetables and fodder crops. Sugarcane takes\nalmost a year to grow.\n\nMajor Crops\n\nA variety of food and non food crops are\ngrown in different parts of the country\ndepending upon the variations in soil, climate\nand cultivation practices. Major crops grown\nin India are rice, wheat, millets, pulses, tea,\ncoffee, sugarcane, oil seeds, cotton and jute,\netc.\n\nRice: It is the staple food crop of a majority of\nthe people in India. Our country is the second\nlargest producer of rice in the world after\nChina. It is a kharif crop which requires high\ntemperature, (above 25°C) and high humidity\nwith annual rainfall above 100 cm.

It is the main food crop, in north\nand north-western part of the country. This\nrabi crop requires a cool growing season and\na bright sunshine at the time of ripening. It\nrequires 50 to 75 cm of annual rainfall evenly-\ndistributed over the growing season.

Though,\nthese are known as coarse grains, they have\nvery high nutritional value. For example, ragi\nis very rich in iron, calcium, other micro\nnutrients and roughage. Jowar is the third\nmost important food crop with respect to area\nand production. It is a rain-fed crop mostly\ngrown in the moist areas which hardly needs\nlirrigation.

Sustained uses of land\nwithout compatible techno-institutional\nchanges have hindered the pace of agricultural\ndevelopment. Inspite of development of sources\nof irrigation most of the farmers in large parts\nof the country still depend upon monsoon and\nnatural fertility in order to carry on their\nagriculture. For a growing population, this\nposes a serious challenge. Agriculture which\nprovides livelihood for more than 60 per cent of\nits population, needs some serious technical\nand institutional reforms. Thus,\ncollectivisation, consolidation of holdings,\ncooperation and abolition of zamindari, etc.\nwere given priority to bring about institutional\nreforms in the country after Independence.\n‘Land reform’ was the main focus of our First\nFive Year Plan. The right of inheritance had\nalready led to fragmentation of land holdings\nnecessitating consolidation of holdings.\n\nThe laws of land reforms were enacted but\nthe implementation was lacking or lukewarm.\nThe Government of India embarked upon\nintroducing agricultural reforms to improve\nIndian agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe Green Revolution based on the use of\npackage technology and the White Revolution\n(Operation Flood) were some of the strategies\ninitiated to improve the lot of Indian agriculture.\nBut, this too led to the concentration of\ndevelopment in few selected areas.

Besides food grains, it also\nproduces raw material for various industries.\n\nCan you name some industries based on\nagricultural raw material?\n\nMoreover, some agricultural products like tea,\ncoffee, spices, etc. are also exported.\n\nTYPES OF FARMING\n\nAgriculture is an age-old economic activity in\nour country. Over these years, cultivation\nmethods have changed significantly depending\nupon the characteristics of physical\nenvironment, technological know-how and\nsocio-cultural practices. Farming varies from\nsubsistence to commercial type. At present,\nin different parts of India, the following\nfarming systems are practised.\n\nPrimitive Subsistence Farming\n\nThis type of farming is still practised in few\npockets of India. Primitive subsistence\nagriculture is practised on small patches of\nland with the help of primitive tools like hoe,\ndao and digging sticks, and family/\ncommunity labour. This type of farming\ndepends upon monsoon, natural fertility of\nthe soil and suitability of other environmental\nconditions to the crops grown.\n\nIt is a ‘slash and burn’ agriculture.\nFarmers clear a patch of land and produce\ncereals and other food crops to sustain their\nfamily. When the soil fertility decreases, the\nfarmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land\nfor cultivation. This type of shifting allows\nNature to replenish the fertility of the soil\n\nthrough natural processes; land productivity\nin this type of agriculture is low as the farmer\ndoes not use fertilisers or other modern\n\ninputs. It is known by different names in\ndifferent parts of the country.\n\nCan you name some such types of farmings?\n\nIt is jhumming in north-eastern states like\nAssam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland;\nPamlou in Manipur, Dipa in Bastar district\nof Chhattishgarh, and in Andaman and\n\nNicobar Islands.\n8\n\nJhumming: The ‘slash and burn’ agriculture\nis known as ‘Milpa’ in Mexico and Central\nAmerica, ‘Conuco’ in Venzuela, ‘Roca’ in\nBrazil, ‘Masole’ in Central Africa, ‘Ladang’\nin Indonesia, ‘Ray’ in Vietnam.\n\nIn India, this primitive form of cultivation\nis called ‘Bewar’ or ‘Dahiya’ in Madhya\nPradesh, ‘Podu’ or ‘Penda’ in Andhra Pradesh,\n‘Pama Dabi’ or ‘Koman’ or Bringa’ in Odisha,\n‘Kumari’ in Western Ghats, ‘Valre’ or ‘Waltre’\nin South-eastern Rajasthan, ‘Khil’ in the\nHimalayan belt, ‘Kuruwa’ in Jharkhand, and\nJhumming’ in the North-eastern region.\n\naa\npies &\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

She\nloves the surroundings and wants to stay\nhere as long as she can, but this little girl\ne has no idea about the declining fertility of\n© the soil and her family’s search for fresh a\ny patch of land in the next season.\n\nCan you name the type of farming Rinjha’s\nfamily is engaged in?\n\nCan you enlist some crops which are grown\nin such farming?\n\nIntensive Subsistence Farming\n\nThis type of farming is practised in areas of\nhigh population pressure on land. It is labour-\nintensive farming, where high doses of\nbiochemical inputs and irrigation are used\nfor obtaining higher production.\n\nCan you name some of the states of India\nwhere such farming is practised?\n\nThough the ‘right of inheritance’ leading\nto the division of land among successive\ngenerations has rendered land-holding size\nuneconomical, the farmers continue to take\nmaximum output from the limited land in\nthe absence of alternative source of livelihood.\nThus, there is enormous pressure on\nagricultural land.\n\nCommercial Farming\n\nThe main characteristic of this type of farming\nis the use of higher doses of modern inputs,\ne.g. high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, chemical\nfertilisers, insecticides and pesticides in order\nto obtain higher productivity. The degree of\ncommercialisation of agriculture varies from\none region to another. For example, rice is a\ncommercial crop in Haryana and Punjab, but\nin Odisha, it is a subsistence crop.\n\nCan you give some more examples of crops\nwhich may be commercial in one region and\nmay provide subsistence in another region?\n\nPlantation is also a type of commercial\nfarming. In this type of farming, a single crop\nis grown on a large area.

These are also\nreflected in agricultural practices and\ncropping patterns in the country. Various\ntypes of food and fibre crops, vegetables and\nfruits, spices and condiments, etc. constitute\nsome of the important crops grown in the\ncountry. India has three cropping seasons\n— rabi, kharif and zaid.\n\nRabi crops are sown in winter from October\nto December and harvested in summer from\nApril to June. Some of the important rabi\ncrops are wheat, barley, peas, gram and\nmustard. Though, these crops are grown in\nlarge parts of India, states from the north\nand north-western parts such as Punjab,\nHaryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and\nKashmir, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are\nimportant for the production of wheat and\nother rabi crops. Availability of precipitation\nduring winter months due to the western\ntemperate cyclones helps in the success of\nthese crops. However, the success of the green\nrevolution in Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar\nPradesh and parts of Rajasthan has also been\nan important factor in the growth of the above-\nmentioned rabi crops.\n\nKharif crops are grown with the onset of\nmonsoon in different parts of the country and\nthese are harvested in September-October.\nImportant crops grown during this season\nare paddy, maize, jowar, bajra, tur (arhar),\nmoong, urad, cotton, jute, groundnut and\nsoyabean. Some of the most important rice-\ngrowing regions are Assam, West Bengal,\ncoastal regions of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh,\nTelangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and\nMaharashtra, particularly the (Konkan coast)\nalong with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Recently,\npaddy has also become an important crop of\nPunjab and Haryana. In states like Assam,\nWest Bengal and Odisha, three crops of paddy\nare grown in a year. These are Aus, Aman\nand Boro.\n\n| In between the rabi and the kharif seasons,\n‘there is a short season during the summer\nmonths known as the Zaid season. Some of\nthe crops produced during ‘zaid’ are\n\nCN CONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nwatermelon, muskmelon, cucumber,\nvegetables and fodder crops. Sugarcane takes\nalmost a year to grow.\n\nMajor Crops\n\nA variety of food and non food crops are\ngrown in different parts of the country\ndepending upon the variations in soil, climate\nand cultivation practices. Major crops grown\nin India are rice, wheat, millets, pulses, tea,\ncoffee, sugarcane, oil seeds, cotton and jute,\netc.\n\nRice: It is the staple food crop of a majority of\nthe people in India. Our country is the second\nlargest producer of rice in the world after\nChina. It is a kharif crop which requires high\ntemperature, (above 25°C) and high humidity\nwith annual rainfall above 100 cm.

Thus,\ncollectivisation, consolidation of holdings,\ncooperation and abolition of zamindari, etc.\nwere given priority to bring about institutional\nreforms in the country after Independence.\n‘Land reform’ was the main focus of our First\nFive Year Plan. The right of inheritance had\nalready led to fragmentation of land holdings\nnecessitating consolidation of holdings.\n\nThe laws of land reforms were enacted but\nthe implementation was lacking or lukewarm.\nThe Government of India embarked upon\nintroducing agricultural reforms to improve\nIndian agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe Green Revolution based on the use of\npackage technology and the White Revolution\n(Operation Flood) were some of the strategies\ninitiated to improve the lot of Indian agriculture.\nBut, this too led to the concentration of\ndevelopment in few selected areas.

He also sees a “kitchen” dragging a\nnumber of house along with it. He is amazed\nand asked his father “Why don’t our houses\nmove like the one we saw in Guwahati, Ba?”\n\nBa replies, “These are not houses, they\nare buses and trains. Unlike our houses these\nare not made of bricks and stones, metal like\niron and alluminium are used in making\n\n@ these. They do not move on their own. They\nare driven by an engine which needs energy\nto work.”\n\nWe use different things in our daily life made\nfrom metal. Can you list a number of items\nused in your house made of metals. Where do\nthese metals come from?\n\nYou have studied that the earth’s crust is\nmade up of different minerals embedded in the\nrocks. Various metals are extracted from these\nminerals after proper refinement.\n\nMinerals are an indispensable part of our\nlives. Almost everything we use, from a tiny pin\nto a towering building or a big ship, all are\nmade from minerals. The railway lines and the\ntarmac (paving) of the roads, our implements\nand machinery too are made from minerals.\nCars, buses, trains, aeroplanes are\nmanufactured from minerals and run on\npower resources derived from the earth. Even\nthe food that we eat contains minerals. In all\nstages of development, human beings have\nused minerals for their livelihood, decoration,\nfestivities, religious and ceremonial rites.\n\n1068CHOS\n\nand minerals\n\ne\nA bright smile from toothpaste\n\nToothpaste cleans your teeth. Abrasive\nminerals like silica, limestone, aluminium\noxide and various phosphate minerals do the\ncleaning. Fluoride which is used to reduce\ncavities, comes from a mineral fluorite. Most\ntoothpaste are made white with titanium\noxide, which comes from minerals called\nrutile, ilmenite and anatase. The sparkle in\nsome toothpastes comes from mica. The\n®@ toothbrush and tube containing the paste are\n\nmade of plastics from petroleum. Find out\nwhere these minerals are found?\n\nDig a little deeper and find out how many\nminerals are used to make a light bulb?\n\nS\nAll living things need minerals\nLife processes cannot occur without minerals.\nAlthough our mineral intake represents only\nabout 0.3 per cent of our total intake of\n@ nutrients, they are so potent and so important\n\nthat without them we would not be able to\nutilise the other 99.7 per cent of foodstuffs.\n\nDig a little deeper and collect “Nutritional\nFacts” printed on food labels.\n\nWhat is a mineral?\n\nGeologists define mineral as a\n“homogenous, naturally occurring substance\nwith a definable internal structure.” Minerals\nare found in varied forms in nature, ranging\nfrom the hardest diamond to the softest talc.\nWhy are they so varied?\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nYou have already learnt about rocks.\nRocks are combinations of homogenous\nsubstances called minerals. Some rocks, for\ninstance limestone, consist of a single mineral\nonly, but majority of the rock consist of several\nminerals in varying proportions. Although,\nover 2000 minerals have been identified, only\na few are abundantly found in most of the\nrocks.\n\nA particular mineral that will be formed\nfrom a certain combination of elements\ndepends upon the physical and chemical\nconditions under which the material forms.\nThis, in turn, results in a wide range of colours,\nhardness, crystal forms, lustre and density that\na particular mineral possesses. Geologists use\nthese properties to classify the minerals.\n\n@-\nStudy of Minerals by Geographers\nand Geologists\n\nGeographers study minerals as part of the ~\nearth’s crust for a better understanding of\nlandforms. The distribution of mineral\nresources and associated economic activities\nare of interest to geographers. A geologist,\n@ however, is interested in the formation of\n\\. minerals, their age and physical and\nchemical composition.\nHowever, for general and commercial\npurposes minerals can be classified as under.\n\nMopDE oF OCCURRENCE OF MINERALS\n\nWhere are these minerals found?\n\nMinerals are usually found in “ores”. The\nterm ore is used to describe an accumulation\nof any mineral mixed with other elements.\nThe mineral content of the ore must be in\n\nsufficient concentration to make its extraction\ncommercially viable. The type of formation or\nstructure in which they are found determines\nthe relative ease with which mineral ores may\nbe mined. This also determines the cost of\nextraction. It is, therefore, important for us\nto understand the main types of formations\nin which minerals occur.\nMinerals generally occur in these forms:\n\n(i) In igneous and metamorphic rocks\nminerals may occur in the cracks,\ncrevices, faults or joints. The smaller\noccurrences are called veins and the\nlarger are called lodes. In most cases,\nthey are formed when minerals in liquid/\nmolten and gaseous forms are forced\nupward through cavities towards the\nearth’s surface. They cool and solidify as\nthey rise. Major metallic minerals like tin,\ncopper, zinc and lead etc. are obtained\nfrom veins and lodes.\n\n(ii) In sedimentary rocks a number of minerals\noccur in beds or layers. They have been\nformed as a result of deposition,\naccumulation and concentration in\nhorizontal strata. Coal and some forms of\niron ore have been concentrated as a result\nof long periods under great heat and\npressure. Another group of sedimentary\nminerals include gypsum, potash salt and\nsodium salt. These are formed as a result\nof evaporation especially in arid regions.\n\n(iii) Another mode of formation involves the\ndecomposition of surface rocks, and the\nremoval of soluble constituents, leaving\na residual mass of weathered\nmaterial containing ores. Bauxite is\nformed this way.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS\n\nMinerals\n\n' a Te”\n\nMetallic\n\nFerrous (containing Non-Ferrous\niron) e.g. iron ore, e.g. copper, lead,\nManganese, nickel __ tin, bauxite, etc.\ncobalt, etc.\n\nFig. 5.1\n\nPrecious\ne.g. gold, silver,\nplatinum, etc.\n\nNon-Metallic Energy Minerals\n\ne.g. mica, salt, Coal\npotash, sulphur, Petroleum\ngranite, limestone, Natural gas\n\nmarble, sandstone, etc.\n\nMINERALS AND ENERGY RESOURCES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\n(iv) Certain minerals may occur as alluvial\ndeposits in sands of valley floors and the\nbase of hills. These deposits are called\n‘placer deposits’ and generally contain\nminerals, which are not corroded by water.\nGold, silver, tin and platinum are most\nimportant among such minerals.\n\n(v) The ocean waters contain vast quantities\nof minerals, but most of these are too widely\ndiffused to be of economic significance.\nHowever, common salt, magnesium and\nbromine are largely derived from ocean\nwaters. The ocean beds, too, are rich in\n\ng mhganese nodules.\n\nInteresting Fact\n\nRat-Hole Mining. Do you know that most\nof the minerals in India are nationalised\nand their extraction is possible only after\nobtaining due permission from the\ngovernment? But in most of the tribal\nareas of the north-east India, minerals are\nowned by individuals or communities. In\nMeghalaya, there are large deposits of coal,\niron ore, limestone and dolomite etc. Coal\nmining in Jowai and Cherapunjee is done\nby family member in the form of a long\nnarrow tunnel, known as ‘Rat hole’\nmining. The National Green Tribunal has\ndeclared such activities illegal and\nrecommended that these should be\nstopped forthwith.\n\nDig a little deeper: What is the difference\nbetween an open pit mine, a quarry and an\nunderground mine with shafts?\n\nIndia is fortunate to have fairly rich and\nvaried mineral resources. However, these are\nunevenly distributed. Broadly speaking,\npeninsular rocks contain most of the reserves\nof coal, metallic minerals, mica and many other\nnon-metallic minerals. Sedimentary rocks on\nthe western and eastern flanks of the peninsula,\nin Gujarat and Assam have most of the\npetroleum deposits. Rajasthan with the rock\nsystems of the peninsula, has reserves of many\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nnon-ferrous minerals. The vast alluvial plains\nof north India are almost devoid of economic\nminerals. These variations exist largely because\nof the differences in the geological structure,\nprocesses and time involved in the formation\nof minerals.\n\nLet us now study the distribution of a few\nmajor minerals in India. Always remember that\nthe concentration of mineral in the ore, the ease\nof extraction and closeness to the market play\nan important role in affecting the economic\nviability of a reserve. Thus, to meet the demand,\na choice has to be made between a number of\npossible options. When this is done a mineral\n‘deposit’ or ‘reserve’ turns into a mine.\n\nFerrous Minerals\n\nFerrous minerals account for about three-\nfourths of the total value of the production of\nmetallic minerals. They provide a strong base\nfor the development of metallurgical industries.\nIndia exports substantial quantities of ferrous\nminerals after meeting her internal demands.\n\nIron Ore\n\nIron ore is the basic mineral and the backbone\nof industrial development. India is endowed\nwith fairly abundant resources of iron ore. India\nis rich in good quality iron ores. Magnetite is\nthe finest iron ore with a very high content of\niron up to 70 per cent. It has excellent magnetic\nqualities, especially valuable in the electrical\nindustry. Hematite ore is the most important\nindustrial iron ore in terms of the quantity\nused, but has a slightly lower iron content than\nmagnetite. (50-60 per cent). In 2018-19 almost\nentire production of iron ore (97%) accrued\nfrom Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and\nJharkhand. The remaining production (3%)\nwas from other states.\n\nDo you know?\n\nKudre in Kannada means horse.

In the adjoining Singbhum\ndistrict of Jnarkhand haematite iron ore is\nmined in Gua and Noamundi.\n\nDurg-Bastar-Chandrapur belt lies in\nChhattisgarh and Maharashtra. Very high\ngrade hematites are found in the famous\nBailadila range of hills in the Bastar district\nof Chhattisgarh. The range of hills\ncomprise of 14 deposits of super high\ngrade hematite iron ore. It has the best\nphysical properties needed for steel\nmaking. Iron ore from these mines is\nexported to Japan and South Korea via\nVishakhapatnam port.\n\nBallari-Chitradurga-Chikkamagaluru-\nTumakuru belt in Karnataka has large\nreserves of iron ore. The Kudremukh mines\nlocated in the Western Ghats of Karnataka\nare a 100 per cent export unit. Kudremukh\ndeposits are known to be one of the largest\nin the world. The ore is transported as\nslurry through a pipeline to a port near\nMangaluru.\n\nMaharashtra-Goa belt includes the state\nof Goa and Ratnagiri district of\n\nMaharashtra. Though, the ores are not of\nvery high quality, yet they are efficiently\nexploited. Iron ore is exported through\nMarmagao port.\n\nManganese\n\nManganese is mainly used in the\nmanufacturing of steel and ferro-manganese\nalloy. Nearly 10 kg of manganese is required\nto manufacture one tonne of steel. It is also\nused in manufacturing bleaching powder,\ninsecticides and paints.\n\nAndhra Others\nPradesh W%\n10%\n\nKarnataka\n12%\nMadhya\n\nPradesh\n33%\n\nOdisha\n16%\n\nMaharashtra\n27%\n\nFig. 5.3: Production of Manganese showing\nstate-wise share in per cent, 2018-19\n\nDig a little deeper: Superimpose the maps\n\nshowing distribution of iron ore, manganese,\n\ncoal and iron and steel industry.

The total volume of workable\nmineral deposits is an insignificant fraction\ni.e. one per cent of the earth’s crust. We are\nrapidly consuming mineral resources that\n\nconcentrated. The geological processes of\nmineral formation are so slow that the rates\nof replenishment are infinitely small in\ncomparison to the present rates of\nconsumption. Mineral resources are,\ntherefore, finite and non-renewable. Rich\nmineral deposits are our country’s extremely\nvaluable but short-lived possessions.\nContinued extraction of ores leads to\nincreasing costs as mineral extraction comes\n\nfrom greater depths along with decrease @.\n\nin quality.\n\nMINERALS AND ENERGY RESOURCES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nAconcerted effort has to be made in order\nto use our mineral resources in a planned\nand sustainable manner. Improved\ntechnologies need to be constantly evolved to\nallow use of low grade ores at low costs.\nRecycling of metals, using scrap metals and\nother substitutes are steps in conserving our\nmineral resources for the future.\n\nDig a little deeper: Make a list of items where\nsubstitutes are being used instead of minerals.\nWhere are these substitutes obtained from?\n\nEnergy Resources\n\nEnergy is required for all activities. It is needed\nto cook, to provide light and heat, to propel\nvehicles and to drive machinery in industries.\n\nEnergy can be generated from fuel\nminerals like coal, petroleum, natural gas,\nuranium and from electricity. Energy\nresources can be classified as conventional\nand non-conventional sources. Conventional\nsources include: firewood, cattle dung cake,\ncoal, petroleum, natural gas and electricity\n(both hydel and thermal). Non-conventional\nsources include solar, wind, tidal, geothermal,\nbiogas and atomic energy. Firewood and cattle\ndung cake are most common in rural India.\nAccording to one estimate more than 70 per\ncent energy requirement in rural households\nis met by these two ; continuation of these is\nincreasingly becoming difficult due to\ndecreasing forest area. Moreover, using dung\ncake too is being discouraged because it\nconsumes most valuable manure which could\nbe used in agriculture.\n\nConventional Sources of Energy\n\nCoal: In India, coal is the most abundantly\navailable fossil fuel. It provides a substantial\npart of the nation’s energy needs. It is used\nfor power generation, to supply energy to\nindustry as well as for domestic needs. India\nis highly dependent on coal for meeting its\ncommercial energy requirements.\n\nAs you are already aware that coal is\nformed due the compression of plant material\nover millions of years. Coal, therefore, is\nfound in a variety of forms depending on the\ndegrees of compression and the depth and\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig. 5.9 (b): A view from outside of a coal mine\n\ntime of burial.

It provides\nfuel for heat and lighting, lubricants for\nmachinery and raw materials for a number of\nmanufacturing industries. Petroleum refineries\nact as a “nodal industry” for synthetic textile,\nfertiliser and numerous chemical industries.\n\nMost of the petroleum occurrences in India\nare associated with anticlines and fault traps\nin the rock formations of the tertiary age. In\nregions of folding, anticlines or domes, it\noccurs where oil is trapped in the crest of the\nupfold. The oil bearing layer is a porous\nlimestone or sandstone through which oil may\nflow. The oil is prevented from rising or\nsinking by intervening non-porous layers.\n\nPetroleum is also found in fault traps\nbetween porous and non-porous rocks. Gas,\nbeing lighter usually occurs above the oil.\n\nMumbai High, Gujarat and Assam are\n\nmajor petroleum production areas in India.\nFrom the map locate the 3 major off shore\nfields of western India.

Rising prices of oil and gas and their\npotential shortages have raised uncertainties\nabout the security of energy supply in future,\nwhich in turn has serious repercussions on the\ngrowth of the national economy. Moreover,\nincreasing use of fossil fuels also causes\nserious environmental problems. Hence, there\nis a pressing need to use renewable energy\nsources like solar energy, wind, tide, biomass\nand energy from waste material. These are\ncalled non-conventional energy sources.\n\nIndia is blessed with an abundance of\nsunlight, water, wind and biomass. It has the\nlargest programmes for the development of\nthese renewable energy resources.\n\nNuclear or Atomic Energy\n\nIt is obtained by altering the structure of\natoms. When such an alteration is made, much\nenergy is released in the form of heat and this\nis used to generate electric power.

Nagarcoil and\nJaisalmer are well known for effective use of\nwind energy in the country.\n\nFig. 5.11: Wind mills — Nagarcoil\n\nBiogas\n\nShrubs, farm waste, animal and human waste\nare used to produce biogas for domestic\nconsumption in rural areas. Decomposition\nof organic matter yields gas, which has higher\nthermal efficiency in comparison to kerosene,\ndung cake and charcoal. Biogas plants are\nset up at municipal, cooperative and\nindividual levels. The plants using cattle dung\nare known as ‘Gobar gas plants’ in rural India.\nThese provide twin benefits to the farmer in\nthe form of energy and improved quality of\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nmanure. Biogas is by far the most efficient\nuse of cattle dung. It improves the quality of\nmanure and also prevents the loss of trees\nand manure due to burning of fuel wood\nand cow dung cakes.\n\nad, — Ey, “9\n\nFig. 5.12: Biogas Plant\n\nTidal Energy\n\nOceanic tides can be used to generate\nelectricity. Floodgate dams are built across\ninlets. During high tide water flows into the\ninlet and gets trapped when the gate is closed.\nAfter the tide falls outside the flood gate, the\nwater retained by the floodgate flows back to\nthe sea via a pipe that carries it through a\npower -generating turbine.\n\nIn India the Gulf of Khambhat, the Gulf\nof Kuchchh in Gujarat on the western coast\nand Gangetic delta in Sunderban regions of\nWest Bengal provide ideal conditions for\nutilising tidal energy.\n\nGeo Thermal Energy\n\nGeo thermal energy refers to the heat and\nelectricity produced by using the heat from\nthe interior of the Earth. Geothermal energy\nexists because, the Earth grows progressively\nhotter with increasing depth. Where the\n\ngeothermal gradient is high, high temperatures\nare found at shallow depths. Groundwater in\nsuch areas absorbs heat from the rocks and\nbecomes hot. It is so hot that when it rises to\nthe earth’s surface, it turns into steam. This\nsteam is used to drive turbines and generate\nelectricity.\n\nThere are several hundred hot springs in\nIndia, which could be used to generate\nelectricity. Two experimental projects have been\nset up in India to harness geothermal energy.\nOne is located in the Parvati valley near\nManikaran in Himachal Pradesh and the other\nis located in the Puga Valley, Ladakh.\n\nConservation of Energy Resources\n\nEnergy is a basic requirement for economic\ndevelopment. Every sector of the national\neconomy — agriculture, industry, transport,\ncommercial and domestic — needs inputs of\nenergy. The economic development plans\nimplemented since Independence necessarily\nrequired increasing amounts of energy to\nremain operational. As aresult, consumption\nof energy in all forms has been steadily rising\nall over the country.\n\nIn this background, there is an urgent need\nto develop a sustainable path of energy\ndevelopment. Promotion of energy conservation\nand increased use of renewable energy sources\nare the twin planks of sustainable energy.\n\nIndia is presently one of the least energy\nefficient countries in the world. We have to\nadopt a cautious approach for the judicious\nuse of our limited energy resources. For\nexample, as concerned citizens we can do our\nbit by using public transport systems instead\nof individual vehicles; switching off electricity\nwhen not in use, using power-saving devices\nand using non-conventional sources of energy.\nAfter all, “energy saved is energy produced”.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

        "text": "You have already learnt about rocks.\nRocks are combinations of homogenous\nsubstances called minerals. Some rocks, for\ninstance limestone, consist of a single mineral\nonly, but majority of the rock consist of several\nminerals in varying proportions. Although,\nover 2000 minerals have been identified, only\na few are abundantly found in most of the\nrocks.\n\nA particular mineral that will be formed\nfrom a certain combination of elements\ndepends upon the physical and chemical\nconditions under which the material forms.\nThis, in turn, results in a wide range of colours,\nhardness, crystal forms, lustre and density that\na particular mineral possesses. Geologists use\nthese properties to classify the minerals.\n\n@-\nStudy of Minerals by Geographers\nand Geologists\n\nGeographers study minerals as part of the ~\nearth’s crust for a better understanding of\nlandforms. The distribution of mineral\nresources and associated economic activities\nare of interest to geographers. A geologist,\n@ however, is interested in the formation of\n\\. minerals, their age and physical and\nchemical composition.\nHowever, for general and commercial\npurposes minerals can be classified as under.\n\nMopDE oF OCCURRENCE OF MINERALS\n\nWhere are these minerals found?\n\nMinerals are usually found in “ores”. The\nterm ore is used to describe an accumulation\nof any mineral mixed with other elements.\nThe mineral content of the ore must be in\n\nsufficient concentration to make its extraction\ncommercially viable. The type of formation or\nstructure in which they are found determines\nthe relative ease with which mineral ores may\nbe mined. This also determines the cost of\nextraction. It is, therefore, important for us\nto understand the main types of formations\nin which minerals occur.\nMinerals generally occur in these forms:\n\n(i) In igneous and metamorphic rocks\nminerals may occur in the cracks,\ncrevices, faults or joints. The smaller\noccurrences are called veins and the\nlarger are called lodes. In most cases,\nthey are formed when minerals in liquid/\nmolten and gaseous forms are forced\nupward through cavities towards the\nearth’s surface. They cool and solidify as\nthey rise. Major metallic minerals like tin,\ncopper, zinc and lead etc. are obtained\nfrom veins and lodes.\n\n(ii) In sedimentary rocks a number of minerals\noccur in beds or layers. They have been\nformed as a result of deposition,\naccumulation and concentration in\nhorizontal strata. Coal and some forms of\niron ore have been concentrated as a result\nof long periods under great heat and\npressure. Another group of sedimentary\nminerals include gypsum, potash salt and\nsodium salt. These are formed as a result\nof evaporation especially in arid regions.\n\n(iii) Another mode of formation involves the\ndecomposition of surface rocks, and the\nremoval of soluble constituents, leaving\na residual mass of weathered\nmaterial containing ores. Bauxite is\nformed this way.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS\n\nMinerals\n\n' a Te”\n\nMetallic\n\nFerrous (containing Non-Ferrous\niron) e.g. iron ore, e.g. copper, lead,\nManganese, nickel __ tin, bauxite, etc.\ncobalt, etc.\n\nFig. 5.1\n\nPrecious\ne.g. gold, silver,\nplatinum, etc.\n\nNon-Metallic Energy Minerals\n\ne.g. mica, salt, Coal\npotash, sulphur, Petroleum\ngranite, limestone, Natural gas\n\nmarble, sandstone, etc.\n\nMINERALS AND ENERGY RESOURCES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

        "text": "(iv) Certain minerals may occur as alluvial\ndeposits in sands of valley floors and the\nbase of hills. These deposits are called\n‘placer deposits’ and generally contain\nminerals, which are not corroded by water.\nGold, silver, tin and platinum are most\nimportant among such minerals.\n\n(v) The ocean waters contain vast quantities\nof minerals, but most of these are too widely\ndiffused to be of economic significance.\nHowever, common salt, magnesium and\nbromine are largely derived from ocean\nwaters. The ocean beds, too, are rich in\n\ng mhganese nodules.\n\nInteresting Fact\n\nRat-Hole Mining. Do you know that most\nof the minerals in India are nationalised\nand their extraction is possible only after\nobtaining due permission from the\ngovernment? But in most of the tribal\nareas of the north-east India, minerals are\nowned by individuals or communities. In\nMeghalaya, there are large deposits of coal,\niron ore, limestone and dolomite etc. Coal\nmining in Jowai and Cherapunjee is done\nby family member in the form of a long\nnarrow tunnel, known as ‘Rat hole’\nmining. The National Green Tribunal has\ndeclared such activities illegal and\nrecommended that these should be\nstopped forthwith.\n\nDig a little deeper: What is the difference\nbetween an open pit mine, a quarry and an\nunderground mine with shafts?\n\nIndia is fortunate to have fairly rich and\nvaried mineral resources. However, these are\nunevenly distributed. Broadly speaking,\npeninsular rocks contain most of the reserves\nof coal, metallic minerals, mica and many other\nnon-metallic minerals. Sedimentary rocks on\nthe western and eastern flanks of the peninsula,\nin Gujarat and Assam have most of the\npetroleum deposits. Rajasthan with the rock\nsystems of the peninsula, has reserves of many\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nnon-ferrous minerals. The vast alluvial plains\nof north India are almost devoid of economic\nminerals. These variations exist largely because\nof the differences in the geological structure,\nprocesses and time involved in the formation\nof minerals.\n\nLet us now study the distribution of a few\nmajor minerals in India. Always remember that\nthe concentration of mineral in the ore, the ease\nof extraction and closeness to the market play\nan important role in affecting the economic\nviability of a reserve. Thus, to meet the demand,\na choice has to be made between a number of\npossible options. When this is done a mineral\n‘deposit’ or ‘reserve’ turns into a mine.\n\nFerrous Minerals\n\nFerrous minerals account for about three-\nfourths of the total value of the production of\nmetallic minerals. They provide a strong base\nfor the development of metallurgical industries.\nIndia exports substantial quantities of ferrous\nminerals after meeting her internal demands.\n\nIron Ore\n\nIron ore is the basic mineral and the backbone\nof industrial development. India is endowed\nwith fairly abundant resources of iron ore. India\nis rich in good quality iron ores. Magnetite is\nthe finest iron ore with a very high content of\niron up to 70 per cent. It has excellent magnetic\nqualities, especially valuable in the electrical\nindustry. Hematite ore is the most important\nindustrial iron ore in terms of the quantity\nused, but has a slightly lower iron content than\nmagnetite. (50-60 per cent). In 2018-19 almost\nentire production of iron ore (97%) accrued\nfrom Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and\nJharkhand. The remaining production (3%)\nwas from other states.\n\nDo you know?\n\nKudre in Kannada means horse. The\nhighest peak in the western ghats of\nKarnataka resembles the face of a horse.\nThe Bailadila hills look like the hump of\nan ox, and hence its name.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

The total volume of workable\nmineral deposits is an insignificant fraction\ni.e. one per cent of the earth’s crust. We are\nrapidly consuming mineral resources that\n\nconcentrated. The geological processes of\nmineral formation are so slow that the rates\nof replenishment are infinitely small in\ncomparison to the present rates of\nconsumption. Mineral resources are,\ntherefore, finite and non-renewable. Rich\nmineral deposits are our country’s extremely\nvaluable but short-lived possessions.\nContinued extraction of ores leads to\nincreasing costs as mineral extraction comes\n\nfrom greater depths along with decrease @.\n\nin quality.\n\nMINERALS AND ENERGY RESOURCES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

It is needed\nto cook, to provide light and heat, to propel\nvehicles and to drive machinery in industries.\n\nEnergy can be generated from fuel\nminerals like coal, petroleum, natural gas,\nuranium and from electricity. Energy\nresources can be classified as conventional\nand non-conventional sources. Conventional\nsources include: firewood, cattle dung cake,\ncoal, petroleum, natural gas and electricity\n(both hydel and thermal). Non-conventional\nsources include solar, wind, tidal, geothermal,\nbiogas and atomic energy. Firewood and cattle\ndung cake are most common in rural India.\nAccording to one estimate more than 70 per\ncent energy requirement in rural households\nis met by these two ; continuation of these is\nincreasingly becoming difficult due to\ndecreasing forest area. Moreover, using dung\ncake too is being discouraged because it\nconsumes most valuable manure which could\nbe used in agriculture.\n\nConventional Sources of Energy\n\nCoal: In India, coal is the most abundantly\navailable fossil fuel. It provides a substantial\npart of the nation’s energy needs. It is used\nfor power generation, to supply energy to\nindustry as well as for domestic needs. India\nis highly dependent on coal for meeting its\ncommercial energy requirements.\n\nAs you are already aware that coal is\nformed due the compression of plant material\nover millions of years. Coal, therefore, is\nfound in a variety of forms depending on the\ndegrees of compression and the depth and\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig. 5.9 (b): A view from outside of a coal mine\n\ntime of burial.

It is the most popular coal\nin commercial use. Metallurgical coal is high\ngrade bituminous coal which has a special\nvalue for smelting iron in blast furnaces.\nAnthracite is the highest quality hard coal.\n\nIn India coal occurs in rock series of two\nmain geological ages, namely Gondwana, a\nlittle over 200 million years in age and in\ntertiary deposits which are only about 55\nmillion years old.

The Godavari,\nMahanadi, Son and Wardha valleys also\ncontain coal deposits.\n\nTertiary coals occur in the north eastern\nstates of Meghalaya, Assam, Arunachal\nPradesh and Nagaland.\n\nRemember coal is a bulky material, which\nloses weight on use as it is reduced to ash.\nHence, heavy industries and thermal power\nstations are located on or near the coalfields.\n\nPetroleum\n\nPetroleum or mineral oil is the next major\nenergy source in India after coal. It provides\nfuel for heat and lighting, lubricants for\nmachinery and raw materials for a number of\nmanufacturing industries. Petroleum refineries\nact as a “nodal industry” for synthetic textile,\nfertiliser and numerous chemical industries.\n\nMost of the petroleum occurrences in India\nare associated with anticlines and fault traps\nin the rock formations of the tertiary age. In\nregions of folding, anticlines or domes, it\noccurs where oil is trapped in the crest of the\nupfold. The oil bearing layer is a porous\nlimestone or sandstone through which oil may\nflow. The oil is prevented from rising or\nsinking by intervening non-porous layers.\n\nPetroleum is also found in fault traps\nbetween porous and non-porous rocks.

Digboi,\nNaharkatiya and Moran-Hugrijan are the\nimportant oil fields in the state.\n\nNatural Gas\n\nNatural Gas is found with petroleum deposits\nand is released when crude oil is brought to\nthe surface. It can be used as a domestic and\nindustrial fuel. It is used as fuel in power sector\nto generate electricity, for heating purpose in\nindustries, as raw material in chemical,\npetrochemical and fertilizer industries, as\ntransport fuel and as cooking fuel.

Show\nthem on the map of India.\n\nNon-Conventional Sources of Energy\n\nThe growing consumption of energy has\nresulted in the country becoming increasingly\ndependent on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and\ngas. Rising prices of oil and gas and their\npotential shortages have raised uncertainties\nabout the security of energy supply in future,\nwhich in turn has serious repercussions on the\ngrowth of the national economy. Moreover,\nincreasing use of fossil fuels also causes\nserious environmental problems. Hence, there\nis a pressing need to use renewable energy\nsources like solar energy, wind, tide, biomass\nand energy from waste material. These are\ncalled non-conventional energy sources.\n\nIndia is blessed with an abundance of\nsunlight, water, wind and biomass. It has the\nlargest programmes for the development of\nthese renewable energy resources.\n\nNuclear or Atomic Energy\n\nIt is obtained by altering the structure of\natoms. When such an alteration is made, much\nenergy is released in the form of heat and this\nis used to generate electric power. Uranium and\nThorium, which are available in Jharkhand and\nthe Aravalli ranges of Rajasthan are used for\ngenerating atomic or nuclear power. The\nMonazite sands of Kerala is also rich in\nThorium.\n\nLocate the 6 nuclear power stations and find\nout the state in which they are located.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nIndia is a tropical country. It has enormous\npossibilities of tapping solar energy.\nPhotovoltaic technology converts sunlight\ndirectly into electricity. Solar energy is fast\nbecoming popular in rural and remote areas.\nSome big solar power plants are being\nestablished in different parts of India which\nwill minimise the dependence of rural\nhouseholds on firewood and dung cakes,\nwhich in turn will contribute to environmental\nconservation and adequate supply of manure\nin agriculture.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig. 5.10: Solar operated electronic milk\ntesting equipment\n\nActivity\n\nCollect information about newly established\n\nsolar power plants in India.\n\nWind power\n\nIndia has great potential of wind power. The\nlargest wind farm cluster is located in Tamil\nNadu from Nagarcoil to Madurai. Apart from\nthese, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat,\nKerala, Maharashtra and Lakshadweep have\nimportant wind farms.

Floodgate dams are built across\ninlets. During high tide water flows into the\ninlet and gets trapped when the gate is closed.\nAfter the tide falls outside the flood gate, the\nwater retained by the floodgate flows back to\nthe sea via a pipe that carries it through a\npower -generating turbine.\n\nIn India the Gulf of Khambhat, the Gulf\nof Kuchchh in Gujarat on the western coast\nand Gangetic delta in Sunderban regions of\nWest Bengal provide ideal conditions for\nutilising tidal energy.\n\nGeo Thermal Energy\n\nGeo thermal energy refers to the heat and\nelectricity produced by using the heat from\nthe interior of the Earth. Geothermal energy\nexists because, the Earth grows progressively\nhotter with increasing depth. Where the\n\ngeothermal gradient is high, high temperatures\nare found at shallow depths. Groundwater in\nsuch areas absorbs heat from the rocks and\nbecomes hot. It is so hot that when it rises to\nthe earth’s surface, it turns into steam. This\nsteam is used to drive turbines and generate\nelectricity.\n\nThere are several hundred hot springs in\nIndia, which could be used to generate\nelectricity. Two experimental projects have been\nset up in India to harness geothermal energy.\nOne is located in the Parvati valley near\nManikaran in Himachal Pradesh and the other\nis located in the Puga Valley, Ladakh.\n\nConservation of Energy Resources\n\nEnergy is a basic requirement for economic\ndevelopment. Every sector of the national\neconomy — agriculture, industry, transport,\ncommercial and domestic — needs inputs of\nenergy. The economic development plans\nimplemented since Independence necessarily\nrequired increasing amounts of energy to\nremain operational. As aresult, consumption\nof energy in all forms has been steadily rising\nall over the country.\n\nIn this background, there is an urgent need\nto develop a sustainable path of energy\ndevelopment. Promotion of energy conservation\nand increased use of renewable energy sources\nare the twin planks of sustainable energy.\n\nIndia is presently one of the least energy\nefficient countries in the world. We have to\nadopt a cautious approach for the judicious\nuse of our limited energy resources. For\nexample, as concerned citizens we can do our\nbit by using public transport systems instead\nof individual vehicles; switching off electricity\nwhen not in use, using power-saving devices\nand using non-conventional sources of energy.\nAfter all, “energy saved is energy produced”.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

His mother ~\npurchased utensils, sugar, tea and diyas\n(earthen lamps). Harish observed that the\nshops in the market were flooded with\nitems for sale. He wondered how so many\nitems could be made in such large\nquantities. His father explained that shoes,\nclothes, sugar etc. are manufactured by\nmachines in large industries, some utensils\nare manufactured in small industries, while\nitems like diyas are made by individual\nartisans in household industry.\n\nDo you have some ideas about these\nindustries?\n\nProduction of goods in large quantities after\nprocessing from raw materials to more\nvaluable products is called manufacturing. Do\nyou know that paper is manufactured from\nwood, sugar from sugarcane, iron and steel\nfrom iron ore and aluminium from bauxite?\nDo you also know that some types of clothes\nare manufactured from yarn which itself is an\nindustrial product?\n\nPeople employed in the secondary activities\nmanufacture the primary materials into\nfinished goods. The workers employed in steel\nfactories, car, breweries, textile industries,\nbakeries etc. fall into this category. Some people\nare employed in providing services. In this\nchapter, we are mainly concerned with\nmanufacturing industries which fall in the\nsecondary sector.\n\nThe economic strength of a country is\nmeasured by the development of\nmanufacturing industries.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF MANUFACTURING\n\nManufacturing sector is considered the backbone\nof development in general and economic\ndevelopment in particular mainly because-\n\ne Manufacturing industries not only help in\nmodernising agriculture, which forms the\nbackbone of our economy, they also reduce\nthe heavy dependence of people on\nagricultural income by providing them jobs\nin secondary and tertiary sectors.\n\n¢ Industrial development is a precondition for\neradication of unemployment and poverty\nfrom our country. This was the main\nphilosophy behind public sector industries\nand joint sector ventures in India. It was also\naimed at bringing down regional disparities\nby establishing industries in tribal and\nbackward areas.\n\ne Export of manufactured goods expands\ntrade and commerce, and brings in much\nneeded foreign exchange.\n\n¢ Countries that transform their raw\nmaterials into a wide variety of finished\ngoods of higher value are prosperous.\nIndia’s prosperity lies in increasing and\ndiversifying its manufacturing industries as\nquickly as possible.\n\nAgriculture and industry are not exclusive\nof each other. They move hand in hand. For\ninstance, the agro-industries in India have\ngiven a major boost to agriculture by raising\nits productivity. They depend on the latter for\nraw materials and sell their products such as\nirrigation pumps, fertilisers, insecticides,\npesticides, plastic and PVC pipes, machines\nand tools, etc. to the farmers. Thus,\ndevelopment and competitiveness of\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nmanufacturing industry has not only\nassisted agriculturists in increasing their\nproduction but also made the production\nprocesses very efficient.\n\nIn the present day world of globalisation,\nour industry needs to be more efficient and\ncompetitive. Self-sufficiency alone is not\nenough. Our manufactured goods must be\nat par in quality with those in the\ninternational market. Only then, will we be\nable to compete in the international market.\n\nClassification of Industries\n\nList the various manufactured products you\nuse in your daily life such as — transistors,\nelectric bulbs, vegetable oil, cement,\nglassware, petrol, matches, scooters,\nautomobiles, medicines and so on. If we\nclassify the various industries based on a\nparticular criterion then we would be\nable to understand their manufacturing\nbetter. Industries may be classified as\nfollows:\n\nOn the basis of source of raw materials\nused:\n\n¢ Agro based: cotton, woollen, jute, silk\ntextile, rubber and sugar, tea, coffee,\nedible oil.\n\ne Mineral based: iron and steel, cement,\naluminium, machine tools,\npetrochemicals.\n\nAccording to their main role:\n\n¢ Basic or key industries are those which\nsupply their products as raw materials to\nmanufacture other goods e.g. iron and\nsteel and copper smelting, aluminum\nsmelting.\n\n¢ Consumer industries that produce goods\nfor direct use by consumers — sugar,\ntoothpaste, paper, sewing machines,\n\nallowed on the assets of a unit. This limit\nhas changed over a period of time. At\npresent the maximum investment allowed\nis rupees one crore.\n\nOn the basis of ownership:\n\n¢ Public sector, owned and operated by\ngovernment agencies — BHEL, SAIL etc.\n\n¢ Private sector industries owned and\noperated by individuals or a group of\nindividuals -TISCO, Bajaj Auto Ltd.,\nDabur Industries.\n\nJoint sector industries which are jointly run\nby the state and individuals or a group of\nindividuals. Oil India Ltd. (OIL) is jointly\nowned by public and private sector.\n\n* Cooperative sector industries are owned\nand operated by the producers or\nsuppliers of raw materials, workers or\nboth. They pool in the resources and share\nthe profits or losses proportionately. Such\nexamples are the sugar industry in\nMaharashtra, the coir industry in Kerala.\n\nBased on the bulk and weight of raw material\nand finished goods:\n\n¢ Heavy industries such as iron and steel\n\ne ° Light industries that use light raw\n\nmaterials and produce light goods such\nas electrical goods industries.\n\nActivity\n\nClassify the following into two groups on the\nbasis of bulk and weight of raw material and\nfinished goods.\n\n(i) Oil (vi) Sewing Machines\n(ii) Knitting needles (vii) Shipbuilding\n(iii) Brassware (viii) Electric Bulbs\n(iv) Fuse wires (ix) Paint brushes\n(v) Watches (x) Automobiles\n\nfans etc. Agro-based Industries\nOn the basis of capital investment: Cotton, jute, silk, woollen textiles, sugar and\n¢ A small scale industry is defined with edible oil, etc. industries are based on\nreference to the maximum investment agricultural raw materials.\n\nMANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES 59\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nFibre\n\nSpinnin\nProduction P  ™\n\nWeaving\nKnitting\n\nDyeing and —> Garment\nFinishing <— manufacture\n\nRaw fibre i Yarn - Fabric ; Garments i\n\nFig. 6.1:\n\nTextile Industry: The textile industry\noccupies unique position in the Indian\neconomy, because it contributes significantly\nto industrial production, employment\ngeneration and foreign exchange earnings. It\nis the only industry in the country, which is\nself-reliant and complete in the value chain\ni.e., from raw material to the highest value\nadded products.\n\nCotton Textiles: In ancient India, cotton\ntextiles were produced with hand spinning\nand handloom weaving techniques. After\nthe 18\" century, power-looms came into\nuse. Our traditional industries suffered a\nsetback during the colonial period because\nthey could not compete with the mill-made\ncloth from England.\n\n* The first successful textile mill was (\n\nestablished in Mumbai in 1854.\n\n¢ The two world wars were fought in Europe,\n\nIndia was a British colony. There was a\n\ne demand for cloth in U.K. hence, they gave\n\na boost to the development of the cotton\ntextile industry.\n\nIn the early years, the cotton textile\nindustry was concentrated in the cotton\ngrowing belt of Maharashtra and Gujarat.\nAvailability of raw cotton, market, transport\nincluding accessible port facilities, labour,\nmoist climate, etc. contributed towards its\nlocalisation. This industry has close links\nwith agriculture and provides a living to\nfarmers, cotton boll pluckers and workers\nengaged in ginning, spinning, weaving,\n\n)\n\nValue addition in the textile industry\n\ndyeing, designing, packaging, tailoring and\nsewing. The industry by creating demands\nsupports many other industries, such as,\nchemicals and dyes, packaging materials\nand engineering works.\n\nWhile spinning continues to be centralised\nin Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu,\nweaving is highly decentralised to provide\nscope for incorporating traditional skills and\ndesigns of weaving in cotton, silk, zari,\nembroidery, etc. India has world class\nproduction in spinning, but weaving supplies\nlow quality of fabric as it cannot use much of\nthe high quality yarn produced in the country.\nWeaving is done by handloom, powerloom and\nin mills.\n\nThe handspun khadi provides large scale\nemployment to weavers in their homes as a\ncottage industry.\n\nWhy did Mahatma Gandhi lay emphasis on\nspinning yarn and weaving khadi?\n\nWhy is it important for our country to\nkeep the mill sector loomage lower than\npower loom and handloom?\n\nJute Textiles\n\nIndia is the largest producer of raw jute and\njute goods and stands at second place as an\nexporter after Bangladesh. Most of the mills are\nlocated in West Bengal, mainly along the banks\nof the Hugli river, in a narrow belt.\n\nThe first jute mill was set up near Kolkata in\n1855 at Rishra. After Partition in 1947, the ‘\njute mills remained in India but three-fourth ~\nof the jute producing area went to\nBangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan).\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\n68°E 12\n\nAFGHANISTAN\n36°N\n\nRa Baramula\n\n( f @=.Srinagar\n\neS abaninng :\n“*\n\nPAKISTAN (\n° Ss Tew\n32 Lye aay\n\nGo Airisar ;\n7 Cuchi\"\n\nMysay\n\nPanipat @ Moradabgé\n\ne Gurugram ®, s ee\n\nBikaner ‘a Agra\n\nJaipur®\nwate ;\n\ndid\n\ntet eden cent eweemneveswes sanity cc ‘\nwtsserereneaspece.\n\nRe 7 E Pepys Bankura ff\n\ne\nVerisidara Indore\n\n‘oho es\n® Wardha\n@ Aurangabad _ :\n\nARABIAN\nSEA\n\n® Pune\n\n16°\n\nLAKSHADWEEP\n(INDIA)\n\nINDIAN\n°F\n\nIndia: Distribution of cotton, woollen and silk industries\n\noe |.\n29e Shahjahanpur“+~.+-\n\n@@Kanpur =>\nVaranasi B | a ae *\n\nINDIA\nTEXTILE INDUSTRIES\n\n)\n\nCHINA\n( I 1B BT )\n\n. i\n\na -—~ -<° Dot Sl se\nLe BHUTAN 3... ./ oe\nNand Su, q ,\n\n\\\n\n7 ? 5 ~~\nMeet OC, \"a a Ss\n\n\"urshidabéd —.\n\n: Tropic of Cancer\n\n*“ Haora\nseh Seas\n\n@ COTTON TEXTILE\n@ WOOLLEN TEXTILE\nf SILK TEXTILE\n\nMANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nFactors responsible for their location in the\nHugli basin are: proximity of the jute producing\nareas, inexpensive water transport, supported\nby a good network of railways, roadways and\nwaterways to facilitate movement of raw\nmaterial to the mills, abundant water for\nprocessing raw jute, cheap labour from West\nBengal and adjoining states of Bihar, Odisha\nand Uttar Pradesh. Kolkata as a large urban\ncentre provides banking, insurance and port\nfacilities for export of jute goods.\n\nSugar Industry\n\nIndia stands second as a world producer of\nsugar but occupies the first place in the\nproduction of gur and khandsari. The raw\nmaterial used in this industry is bulky, and in\nhaulage its sucrose content reduces. The mills\nare located in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,\nMaharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra\nPradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana and\nMadhya Pradesh. Sixty per cent mills are in\nUttar Pradesh and Bihar. This industry is\nseasonal in nature so, it is ideally suited to the\ncooperative sector. Can you explain why this\nis so?\n\nIn recent years, there is a tendency for the\nmills to shift and concentrate in the southern\nand western states, especially in Maharashtra,\nThis is because the cane produced here has a\nhigher sucrose content. The cooler climate also\nensures a longer crushing season. Moreover,\nthe cooperatives are more successful in these\n\nMineral-based Industries\n\nIndustries that use minerals and metals as raw\nmaterials are called mineral-based industries.\nCan you name some industries that would fall\nin this category?\n\nIron and Steel Industry\n\nThe iron and steel industry is the basic industry\nsince all the other industries — heavy, medium\nand light, depend on it for their machinery.\nSteel is needed to manufacture a variety of\nengineering goods, construction material,\ndefence, medical, telephonic, scientific\nequipment and a variety of consumer goods.\n\nActivity\nMake a list of all such goods made of steel\nthat you can think of.\n\nProduction and consumption of steel is\noften regarded as the index of a country’s\ndevelopment. Iron and steel is a heavy industry\nbecause all the raw materials as well as\nfinished goods are heavy and bulky entailing\nheavy transportation costs. Iron ore, coking\ncoal and lime stone are required in the ratio of\napproximately 4 : 2: 1. Some quantities of\nmanganese, are also required to harden the\nsteel. Where should the steel plants be ideally\nlocated?

It is largely, because of the relative\nadvantages this region has for the development\nof this industry. These include, low cost of iron\nore, high grade raw materials in proximity,\ncheap labour and vast growth potential in the\nhome market.\n\nAluminium Smelting\n\nAluminium smelting is the second most\nimportant metallurgical industry in India. It is\nlight, resistant to corrosion, a good conductor of\nheat, malleable and becomes strong when it is\nmixed with other metals. It is used to\nmanufacture aircraft, utensils and wires. It has\ngained popularity as a substitute of steel, copper,\nzinc and lead in a number of industries.\n\nFig. 6.3: Strip coasting mill at smelter of NALCO\n\nAluminium smelting plants in the country\nare located in Odisha, West Bengal, Kerala,\nUttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and\nTamil Nadu.\n\nBauxite, the raw material used in the\nsmelters is a very bulky, dark reddish coloured\nrock. The flow chart given below shows the\nprocess of manufacturing aluminium. Regular\nsupply of electricity and an assured source of\nraw material at minimum cost are the two\nprime factors for location of the industry.\n\nChemical Industries\n\nThe Chemical industry in India is fast growing\nand diversifying. It comprises both large and\nsmall scale manufacturing units. Rapid growth\nhas been recorded in both inorganic and\norganic sectors. Inorganic chemicals include\nsulphuric acid (used to manufacture fertilizers,\nsynthetic fibres, plastics, adhesives, paints,\ndyes stuffs), nitric acid, alkalies, soda ash (used\nto make glass, soaps and detergents, paper)\nand caustic soda. These industries are widely\nspread over the country.\n\nWhy do you think it is so?\n\nOrganic chemicals include petrochemicals,\nwhich are used for manufacturing of synthetic\nfibers, synthetic rubber, plastics, dye-stuffs,\ndrugs and pharmaceuticals.

Basic chemicals undergo processing\nto further produce other chemicals that are\nused for industrial application, agriculture or\ndirectly for consumer markets. Make a list of\nthe products you are aware of.\n\nFertilizer Industry\n\nThe fertilizer industry is centred around the\nproduction of nitrogenous fertilizers (mainly\nurea), phosphatic fertilizers and ammonium\nphosphate (DAP) and complex fertilizers which\nhave a combination of nitrogen (N), phosphate\n(P), and potash (K). The third, i.e. potash is\nentirely imported as the country does not have\nany reserves of commercially usable potash or\npotassium compounds in any form.\n\nAfter the Green Revolution the industry\nexpanded to several other parts of the country.\nGujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and\nKerala contribute towards half of the fertilizer\nproduction. Other significant producers are\nAndhra Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Bihar,\nMaharashtra, Assam, West Bengal, Goa, Delhi,\nMadhya Pradesh and Karnataka.\n\nCement Industry\n\nCement is essential for construction activity\nsuch as building houses, factories, bridges,\nroads, airports, dams and for other commercial\nestablishments. This industry requires bulky\nand heavy raw materials like limestone, silica\nand gypsum. Coal and electric power are\nneeded apart from rail transportation.\n\nActivity\n\nWhere would it be economically viable to\n\nset up the cement manufacturing units?\n\nThe industry has strategically located\nplants in Gujarat that have suitable access to\nthe market in the Gulf countries.\n\nActivity\nFind out where the plants are located in other\nStates of India. Find their names.\n\nThe first cement plant was set-up in\nChennai in 1904. After Independence the\nindustry expanded.\n\nAutomobile Industry\n\nAutomobiles provide vehicle for quick\ntransport of good services and passengers.\nTrucks, buses, cars, motor cycles, scooters,\nthree-wheelers and multi-utility vehicles are\nmanufactured in India at various centres. After\nthe liberalisation, the coming in of new and\ncontemporary models stimulated the demand\nfor vehicles in the market, which led to the\nhealthy growth of the industry including\npassenger cars, two and three-wheelers. The\nindustry is located around Delhi, Gurugram,\nMumbai, Pune, Chennai, Kolkata, Lucknow,\nIndore, Hyderabad, Jamshedpur and\nBengaluru.\n\nInformation Technology and\nElectronics Industry\n\nThe electronics industry covers a wide range\nof products from transistor sets to television,\ntelephones, cellular telecom, telephone\nexchange, radars, computers and many\nother equipments required by the\ntelecommunication industry. Bengaluru has\nemerged as the electronic capital of India. Other\nimportant centres for electronic goods are\nMumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Pune, Chennai,\nKolkata, Lucknow and Coimbatore. The major\nindustry concentration is at Bengaluru, Noida,\nMumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune. A\nmajor impact of this industry has been on\nemployment generation. The continuing\ngrowth in the hardware and software is the key\nto the success of IT industry in India.\n\nalee\nwv 2\n\ned p =\n\nFig. 6.6: Cable manufacturing facilities at HCL,\nRupnarainpur (West Bengal)\n\nMANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n>\n\n\nIndustrial Pollution and Environmental\nDegradation\n\nAlthough industries contribute significantly to\nIndia’s economic growth and development, the\nincrease in pollution of land, water, air, noise\nand resulting degradation of environment that\nthey have caused, cannot be overlooked.\nIndustries are responsible for four types of\npollution: (a) Air (b) Water (c) Land (d) Noise.\nThe polluting industries also include thermal\npower plants.\n\nAir pollution is caused by the presence of high\nproportion of undesirable gases, such as\nsulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Air-\nborne particulate materials contain both solid\nand liquid particles like dust, sprays mist and\nsmoke. Smoke is emitted by chemical and\npaper factories, brick kilns, refineries and\nsmelting plants, and burning of fossil fuels in\nbig and small factories that ignore pollution\nnorms. Toxic gas leaks can be very hazardous\nwith long-term effects. Are you aware of the\nBhopal Gas tragedy that occurred? Air\npollution adversely affects human health,\nanimals, plants, buildings and the atmosphere\nas a whole.\n\nWater pollution is caused by organic and\ninorganic industrial wastes and affluents\ndischarged into rivers. The main culprits in this\nregard are paper, pulp, chemical, textile and\ndyeing, petroleum refineries, tanneries and\nelectroplating industries that let out dyes,\ndetergents, acids, salts and heavy metals like\nlead and mercury pesticides, fertilisers,\nsynthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and\nrubber, etc. into the water bodies. Fly ash,\nphospo- gypsum and iron and steel slags are\nthe major solid wastes in India.\n\nThermal pollution of water occurs when hot\nwater from factories and thermal plants is\ndrained into rivers and ponds before cooling.\nWhat would be the effect on aquatic life?\nWastes from nuclear power plants, nuclear\nand weapon production facilities cause\ncancers, birth defects and miscarriages. Soil\nand water pollution are closely related.\n\nDumping of wastes specially glass, harmful\nchemicals, industrial effluents, packaging, salts\nand garbage renders the soil useless. Rain\nwater percolates to the soil carrying the\npollutants to the ground and the ground water\nalso gets contaminated.\n\nNoise pollution not only results in irritation\nand anger, it can also cause hearing\nimpairment, increased heart rate and blood\npressure among other physiological effects.\nUnwanted sound is an irritant and a source of\nstress. Industrial and construction activities,\nmachinery, factory equipment, generators,\nsaws and pneumatic and electric drills also\nmake a lot of noise.\n\nControl of Environmental Degradation\n\nEvery litre of waste water discharged by our\nindustry pollutes eight times the quantity of\nfreshwater. How can the industrial pollution of\nfresh water be reduced? Some suggestions are-\n(i) minimising use water for processing by\nreusing and recycling it in two or more\nsuccessive stages\n\n(ii) harvesting of rainwater to meet water\nrequirements\n\n(iii) treating hot water and effluents before\nreleasing them in rivers and ponds.\nTreatment of industrial effluents can be\ndone in three phases\n\n(a) Primary treatment by mechanical means.\nThis involves screening, grinding,\nflocculation and sedimentation.\n\n(b) Secondary treatment by biological process\n\n(c) Tertiary treatment by biological,\nchemical and physical processes. This\ninvolves recycling of wastewater.\n\nOverdrawing of ground water reserves by\n\nindustry where there is a threat to ground\nwater resources also needs to be regulated\nlegally. Particulate matter in the air can be\nreduced by fitting smoke stacks to factories\nwith electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters,\nscrubbers and inertial separators. Smoke\ncan be reduced by using oil or gas instead\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\n68°E 12°\n\nAFGHANISTAN\n36°N\n\nPAKISTAN\n39°\n\n/S 4 ial\n: hali i\nJj Mo alii\n\nNiger oe\nBes rises Se\n\n‘29 Noida ~\n\nJaipur %& So w..\n\nARABIAN\nSEA\n\n(Ce 5\n\n16° ge ; Hyderabad\n\nsor\n\n° Ore\né\n\n“. -\n\nbad e\n\nLAKSHADWEEP\n\nINDIAN\n72°E\n\nim _¢ .\nut seee\n\n36°N\nINDIA\n\nSOME SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY PARKS\n\nCHINA\nCTIBET )\n\nati >\n\n€\n\nr-\n\nBAY OF\nBENGAL\n\nVishakhapatnam\n\nANDAMAN & NICOBAR ISLANDS\n(INDIA)\n°\n600 km es Q\n*» 8°N\n°\n\n92°F\n\nIndia: Some Software Technology Parks\n\nMANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n\nof coal in factories.

His mother ~\npurchased utensils, sugar, tea and diyas\n(earthen lamps). Harish observed that the\nshops in the market were flooded with\nitems for sale. He wondered how so many\nitems could be made in such large\nquantities. His father explained that shoes,\nclothes, sugar etc. are manufactured by\nmachines in large industries, some utensils\nare manufactured in small industries, while\nitems like diyas are made by individual\nartisans in household industry.\n\nDo you have some ideas about these\nindustries?\n\nProduction of goods in large quantities after\nprocessing from raw materials to more\nvaluable products is called manufacturing. Do\nyou know that paper is manufactured from\nwood, sugar from sugarcane, iron and steel\nfrom iron ore and aluminium from bauxite?\nDo you also know that some types of clothes\nare manufactured from yarn which itself is an\nindustrial product?\n\nPeople employed in the secondary activities\nmanufacture the primary materials into\nfinished goods. The workers employed in steel\nfactories, car, breweries, textile industries,\nbakeries etc. fall into this category. Some people\nare employed in providing services. In this\nchapter, we are mainly concerned with\nmanufacturing industries which fall in the\nsecondary sector.\n\nThe economic strength of a country is\nmeasured by the development of\nmanufacturing industries.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF MANUFACTURING\n\nManufacturing sector is considered the backbone\nof development in general and economic\ndevelopment in particular mainly because-\n\ne Manufacturing industries not only help in\nmodernising agriculture, which forms the\nbackbone of our economy, they also reduce\nthe heavy dependence of people on\nagricultural income by providing them jobs\nin secondary and tertiary sectors.\n\n¢ Industrial development is a precondition for\neradication of unemployment and poverty\nfrom our country. This was the main\nphilosophy behind public sector industries\nand joint sector ventures in India. It was also\naimed at bringing down regional disparities\nby establishing industries in tribal and\nbackward areas.\n\ne Export of manufactured goods expands\ntrade and commerce, and brings in much\nneeded foreign exchange.\n\n¢ Countries that transform their raw\nmaterials into a wide variety of finished\ngoods of higher value are prosperous.\nIndia’s prosperity lies in increasing and\ndiversifying its manufacturing industries as\nquickly as possible.\n\nAgriculture and industry are not exclusive\nof each other. They move hand in hand. For\ninstance, the agro-industries in India have\ngiven a major boost to agriculture by raising\nits productivity.

The industry by creating demands\nsupports many other industries, such as,\nchemicals and dyes, packaging materials\nand engineering works.\n\nWhile spinning continues to be centralised\nin Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu,\nweaving is highly decentralised to provide\nscope for incorporating traditional skills and\ndesigns of weaving in cotton, silk, zari,\nembroidery, etc. India has world class\nproduction in spinning, but weaving supplies\nlow quality of fabric as it cannot use much of\nthe high quality yarn produced in the country.\nWeaving is done by handloom, powerloom and\nin mills.\n\nThe handspun khadi provides large scale\nemployment to weavers in their homes as a\ncottage industry.\n\nWhy did Mahatma Gandhi lay emphasis on\nspinning yarn and weaving khadi?\n\nWhy is it important for our country to\nkeep the mill sector loomage lower than\npower loom and handloom?\n\nJute Textiles\n\nIndia is the largest producer of raw jute and\njute goods and stands at second place as an\nexporter after Bangladesh. Most of the mills are\nlocated in West Bengal, mainly along the banks\nof the Hugli river, in a narrow belt.\n\nThe first jute mill was set up near Kolkata in\n1855 at Rishra. After Partition in 1947, the ‘\njute mills remained in India but three-fourth ~\nof the jute producing area went to\nBangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan).\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

Kolkata as a large urban\ncentre provides banking, insurance and port\nfacilities for export of jute goods.\n\nSugar Industry\n\nIndia stands second as a world producer of\nsugar but occupies the first place in the\nproduction of gur and khandsari. The raw\nmaterial used in this industry is bulky, and in\nhaulage its sucrose content reduces. The mills\nare located in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,\nMaharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra\nPradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana and\nMadhya Pradesh. Sixty per cent mills are in\nUttar Pradesh and Bihar. This industry is\nseasonal in nature so, it is ideally suited to the\ncooperative sector. Can you explain why this\nis so?\n\nIn recent years, there is a tendency for the\nmills to shift and concentrate in the southern\nand western states, especially in Maharashtra,\nThis is because the cane produced here has a\nhigher sucrose content. The cooler climate also\nensures a longer crushing season. Moreover,\nthe cooperatives are more successful in these\n\nMineral-based Industries\n\nIndustries that use minerals and metals as raw\nmaterials are called mineral-based industries.\nCan you name some industries that would fall\nin this category?\n\nIron and Steel Industry\n\nThe iron and steel industry is the basic industry\nsince all the other industries — heavy, medium\nand light, depend on it for their machinery.\nSteel is needed to manufacture a variety of\nengineering goods, construction material,\ndefence, medical, telephonic, scientific\nequipment and a variety of consumer goods.\n\nActivity\nMake a list of all such goods made of steel\nthat you can think of.\n\nProduction and consumption of steel is\noften regarded as the index of a country’s\ndevelopment. Iron and steel is a heavy industry\nbecause all the raw materials as well as\nfinished goods are heavy and bulky entailing\nheavy transportation costs. Iron ore, coking\ncoal and lime stone are required in the ratio of\napproximately 4 : 2: 1. Some quantities of\nmanganese, are also required to harden the\nsteel.

        "text": "Industrial Pollution and Environmental\nDegradation\n\nAlthough industries contribute significantly to\nIndia’s economic growth and development, the\nincrease in pollution of land, water, air, noise\nand resulting degradation of environment that\nthey have caused, cannot be overlooked.\nIndustries are responsible for four types of\npollution: (a) Air (b) Water (c) Land (d) Noise.\nThe polluting industries also include thermal\npower plants.\n\nAir pollution is caused by the presence of high\nproportion of undesirable gases, such as\nsulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Air-\nborne particulate materials contain both solid\nand liquid particles like dust, sprays mist and\nsmoke. Smoke is emitted by chemical and\npaper factories, brick kilns, refineries and\nsmelting plants, and burning of fossil fuels in\nbig and small factories that ignore pollution\nnorms. Toxic gas leaks can be very hazardous\nwith long-term effects. Are you aware of the\nBhopal Gas tragedy that occurred? Air\npollution adversely affects human health,\nanimals, plants, buildings and the atmosphere\nas a whole.\n\nWater pollution is caused by organic and\ninorganic industrial wastes and affluents\ndischarged into rivers. The main culprits in this\nregard are paper, pulp, chemical, textile and\ndyeing, petroleum refineries, tanneries and\nelectroplating industries that let out dyes,\ndetergents, acids, salts and heavy metals like\nlead and mercury pesticides, fertilisers,\nsynthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and\nrubber, etc. into the water bodies. Fly ash,\nphospo- gypsum and iron and steel slags are\nthe major solid wastes in India.\n\nThermal pollution of water occurs when hot\nwater from factories and thermal plants is\ndrained into rivers and ponds before cooling.\nWhat would be the effect on aquatic life?\nWastes from nuclear power plants, nuclear\nand weapon production facilities cause\ncancers, birth defects and miscarriages. Soil\nand water pollution are closely related.\n\nDumping of wastes specially glass, harmful\nchemicals, industrial effluents, packaging, salts\nand garbage renders the soil useless. Rain\nwater percolates to the soil carrying the\npollutants to the ground and the ground water\nalso gets contaminated.\n\nNoise pollution not only results in irritation\nand anger, it can also cause hearing\nimpairment, increased heart rate and blood\npressure among other physiological effects.\nUnwanted sound is an irritant and a source of\nstress. Industrial and construction activities,\nmachinery, factory equipment, generators,\nsaws and pneumatic and electric drills also\nmake a lot of noise.\n\nControl of Environmental Degradation\n\nEvery litre of waste water discharged by our\nindustry pollutes eight times the quantity of\nfreshwater. How can the industrial pollution of\nfresh water be reduced? Some suggestions are-\n(i) minimising use water for processing by\nreusing and recycling it in two or more\nsuccessive stages\n\n(ii) harvesting of rainwater to meet water\nrequirements\n\n(iii) treating hot water and effluents before\nreleasing them in rivers and ponds.\nTreatment of industrial effluents can be\ndone in three phases\n\n(a) Primary treatment by mechanical means.\nThis involves screening, grinding,\nflocculation and sedimentation.\n\n(b) Secondary treatment by biological process\n\n(c) Tertiary treatment by biological,\nchemical and physical processes. This\ninvolves recycling of wastewater.\n\nOverdrawing of ground water reserves by\n\nindustry where there is a threat to ground\nwater resources also needs to be regulated\nlegally. Particulate matter in the air can be\nreduced by fitting smoke stacks to factories\nwith electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters,\nscrubbers and inertial separators. Smoke\ncan be reduced by using oil or gas instead\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

Some of these are available in our\nimmediate surroundings, while other\nrequirements are met by bringing things from\nother places. Goods and services do not move\nfrom supply locales to demand locales on their\nown. The movement of these goods and services\nfrom their supply locations to demand locations\nnecessitates the need for transport. Some people\nare engaged in facilitating these movements.\nThese are known to be traders who make the\nproducts come to the consumers by\ntransportation. Thus, the pace of development\nof a country depends upon the production of\ngoods and services as well as their movement\nover space. Therefore, efficient means of transport\nare prerequisites for fast development.\nMovement of these goods and services can be\nover three important domains of our earth i.e. land,\nwater and air. Based on these, transport can also\nbe classified into land, water and air transport.\n\nthe help of equally developed communication\nsystem. Therefore, transport, communication\nand trade are complementary to each other.\n\nToday, India is well-linked with the rest of\nthe world despite its vast size, diversity and\nlinguistic and socio-cultural plurality.\nRailways, airways, waterways, newspapers,\nradio, television, cinema and internet, etc. have\nbeen contributing to its socio-economic\nprogress in many ways. The trades from local\nto international levels have added to the vitality\nof its economy. It has enriched our life and\nadded substantially to growing amenities and\nfacilities for the comforts of life.\n\nIn this chapter, you will see how modern\nmeans of transport and communication serve\nas lifelines of our nation and its modern\neconomy. It is thus, evident that a dense and\nefficient network of transport and\ncommunication is a prerequisite for local,\nnational and global trade of today.\n\nMeans of Transport\n\nSS —,,\n\nLand Water Air |\nRoadways Railways Pipelines Inland Overseas nae ee a\nPublic Undertaking\nPrivate Airlines\nFig. 7.1\nFor a long time, trade and transport were ‘TRANSPORT\nrestricted to a limited space.

Today, the world has\nbeen converted into a large village with the help\nof efficient and fast moving transport.\nTransport has been able to achieve this with\n\nIndia has second largest road networks in the\nworld, aggregating to about 62.16 lakh km\n(2020-21). In India, roadways have preceded\nrailways. They still have an edge over railways\nin view of the ease with which they can be built\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nand maintained. The growing importance of\nroad transport vis-a-vis rail transport is\nrooted in the following reasons; (a)\nconstruction cost of roads is much lower\nthan that of railway lines, (b) roads can\ntraverse comparatively more dissected and\nundulating topography, (c) roads can\nnegotiate higher gradients of slopes and as\nsuch can traverse mountains such as the\nHimalayas, (d) road transport is economical\nin transportation of few persons and\nrelatively smaller amount of goods over\nshort distances, (e) it also provides door-\nto-door service, thus the cost of loading\nand unloading is much lower, (f) road\ntransport is also used as a feeder to other\nmodes of transport such as they provide a\nlink between railway stations, air and\nsea ports.\n\nIn India, roads are classified in the\nfollowing six classes according to their\ncapacity. Look at the map of the National\nHighways and find out about the significant\nrole played by these roads.\n\n¢ Golden Quadrilateral Super Highways:\nThe government has launched a major\nroad development project linking Delhi-\nKolkata-Chennai-Mumbai and Delhi by\nsix-lane Super Highways. The North-\nSouth corridors linking Srinagar (Jammu\n& Kashmir) and Kanniyakumari (Tamil\nNadu), and East-West Corridor\nconnecting Silchar (Assam) and Porbander\n(Gujarat) are part of this project. The\nmajor objective of these Super Highways\nis to reduce the time and distance\nbetween the mega cities of India.

Railways also make it possible for\npeople to conduct multifarious activities\nlike business, sightseeing, pilgrimage\nalong with transportation of goods over\nlonger distances. Apart from an important\nmeans of transport the Indian Railways\nhave been a great integrating force for more\nthan 150 years. Railways in India bind the\neconomic life of the country as well as\naccelerate the development of the industry\nand agriculture.\n\n8\nThe Indian Railways is the largest public\n\ne sector undertaking in the country. The first\ntrain steamed off from Mumbai to Thane in\n1853, covering a distance of 34 km.\n\nThe Indian Railway is now reorganised into\n17 zones.\n\n- Activity ————+\nFind out the current Railway zones and their\nheadquarters. Also locate the headquarters\nof Railway zones on the map of India.\n\nThe distribution pattern of the Railway\nnetwork in the country has been largely\ninfluenced by physiographic, economic and\nadministrative factors. The northern plains with\ntheir vast level land, high population density\nand rich agricultural resources provided the most\nfavourable condition for their growth. However,\na large number of rivers requiring construction\nof bridges across their wide beds posed some\nobstacles. In the hilly terrains of the peninsular\nregion, railway tracts are laid through low hills,\ngaps or tunnels. The Himalayan mountainous\nregions too are unfavourable for the construction\nof railway lines due to high relief, sparse\npopulation and lack of economic opportunities.\nLikewise, it was difficult to lay railway lines on\nthe sandy plain of western Rajasthan, swamps\nof Gujarat, forested tracks of Madhya Pradesh,\nChhattisgarh, Odisha and Jharkhand. The\ncontiguous stretch of Sahyadri could be crossed\n\n\n\nTable 7.1: India: Railway Track\nThe Indian Railway network runs on multiple gauge operations extending over 67,956 km.\n\nGauge in metres\n\nBroad Gauge (1.676)\n\nMetre Gauge (1.000)\nNarrow Gauge (0.762 and 0.610)\n\nRoute (Km)\n\nSource: Railway Yearbook 2019-20, Ministry of Railways, Government of India.\n\nWebsite: www.indianrailways.gov.in\n\nonly through gaps or passes (Ghats). In recent\ntimes, the development of the Konkan railway\nalong the west coast has facilitated the movement\nof passengers and goods in this most important\neconomic region of India. It has also faced a\nnumber of problem such as sinking of track in\nsome stretches and landslides.\n\nToday, the railways have become more\nimportant in our national economy than all\nother means of transport put together. However,\nrail transport suffers from certain problems as\nwell. Many passengers travel without tickets.\nThefts and damaging of railway property has\nnot yet stopped completely. People stop the\ntrains, pull the chain unnecessarily and this\ncauses heavy damage to the railway. Think over\nit, how we can help our railway in running as\nper the scheduled time?\n\nPipelines\n\nPipeline transport network is a new arrival on\nthe transportation map of India. In the past,\nthese were used to transport water to cities and\nindustries. Now, these are used for transporting\ncrude oil, petroleum products and natural gas\nfrom oil and natural gas fields to refineries,\nfertilizer factories and big thermal power plants.\nSolids can also be transported through a\npipeline when converted into slurry. The far\ninland locations of refineries like Barauni,\nMathura, Panipat and gas based fertilizer plants\ncould be thought of only because of pipelines.\nInitial cost of laying pipelines is high but\nsubsequent running costs are minimal. It rules\nout trans-shipment losses or delays.\n\nThere are three important networks of\npipeline transportation in the country.\n\ne From oil field in upper Assam to Kanpur\n(Uttar Pradesh), via Guwahati, Barauni and\nPrayagraj. It has branches from Barauni to\nHaldia, via Rajbandh, Rajbandh to\nMaurigram and Guwahati to Siliguri.\n\ne From Salaya in Gujarat to Jalandhar in\nPunjab, via Viramgam, Mathura, Delhi and\nSonipat. It has branches to connect Koyali\n(near Vadodara, Gujarat) Chakshu and\nother places.\n\ne The first 1,700 km long Hazira-Vijaipur-\nJagdishpur (HVJ) cross country gas\npipeline, linked Mumbai High and Bassein\ngas fields with various ferilizer, power and\nindustrial complexes in western and\nnorthern India. Overall, India’s gas pipeline\ninfrastructure has expanded from 1,700 km\nto 18,500 km of cross-country pipelines.\n\nWaterways\n\nSince the ancient period, India was one of the\nseafaring countries. Its seamen sailed far and\nnear, thus, carrying and spreading Indian\ncommerce and culture. Waterways are the\ncheapest means of transport. They are most\nsuitable for carrying heavy and bulky goods. It\nis a fuel-efficient and environment friendly mode\nof transport. India has inland navigation\nwaterways of 14,500 km in length. In order to\ncreate wide waterways network and to promote\ninland water transport in the country as an\neconomical environment friendly\nsupplementary mode of transport to rail and\nroad, 111 inland waterways (including 5\nNational Waterways declared earlier) were\ndeclared as National Waterways (NWs) by the\nNational Waterways Act, 2016.

But, the pace of change, has\nbeen rapid in modern times. Long distance\ncommunication is far easier without physical\nmovement of the communicator or receiver.\nPersonal communication and mass\ncommunication including television, radio,\npress, films, etc. are the major means of\ncommunication in the country. The Indian\npostal network is the largest in the world. It\nhandles parcels as well as personal written\ncommunications. Cards and envelopes are\nconsidered first-class mail and are airlifted\nbetween stations covering both land and air.\nThe second-class mail includes book packets,\nregistered newspapers and periodicals. They\nare carried by surface mail, covering land and\nwater transport. To facilitate quick delivery\nof mails in large towns and cities, six mail\nchannels have been introduced recently.

It\nproduces short films; video feature films and\nvideo short films. The Central Board of Film\nCertification is the authority to certify both\nIndian and foreign films.\n\nInternational Trade\n\nThe exchange of goods among people, states\nand countries is referred to as trade. The\nmarket is the place where such exchanges\ntake place. Trade between two countries is\ncalled international trade. It may take place\nthrough sea, air or land routes. While local\ntrade is carried in cities, towns and villages,\nstate level trade is carried between two or more\nstates. Advancement of international trade of\na country is an index to its economic\nprosperity. It is, therefore, considered the\neconomic barometer for a country.\n\nAs the resources are space bound, no\ncountry can survive without international\ntrade. Export and import are the components\nof trade. The balance of trade of a country is\nthe difference between its export and import.\nWhen the value of export exceeds the value\nof imports, it is called a favourable balance\nof trade. On the contrary, if the value of\nimports exceeds the value of exports, it is\ntermed as unfavourable balance of trade.\n\nIndia has trade relations with all the major\ntrading blocks and all geographical regions\nof the world.

The movement of these goods and services\nfrom their supply locations to demand locations\nnecessitates the need for transport. Some people\nare engaged in facilitating these movements.\nThese are known to be traders who make the\nproducts come to the consumers by\ntransportation. Thus, the pace of development\nof a country depends upon the production of\ngoods and services as well as their movement\nover space. Therefore, efficient means of transport\nare prerequisites for fast development.\nMovement of these goods and services can be\nover three important domains of our earth i.e. land,\nwater and air.

The growing importance of\nroad transport vis-a-vis rail transport is\nrooted in the following reasons; (a)\nconstruction cost of roads is much lower\nthan that of railway lines, (b) roads can\ntraverse comparatively more dissected and\nundulating topography, (c) roads can\nnegotiate higher gradients of slopes and as\nsuch can traverse mountains such as the\nHimalayas, (d) road transport is economical\nin transportation of few persons and\nrelatively smaller amount of goods over\nshort distances, (e) it also provides door-\nto-door service, thus the cost of loading\nand unloading is much lower, (f) road\ntransport is also used as a feeder to other\nmodes of transport such as they provide a\nlink between railway stations, air and\nsea ports.\n\nIn India, roads are classified in the\nfollowing six classes according to their\ncapacity. Look at the map of the National\nHighways and find out about the significant\nrole played by these roads.\n\n¢ Golden Quadrilateral Super Highways:\nThe government has launched a major\nroad development project linking Delhi-\nKolkata-Chennai-Mumbai and Delhi by\nsix-lane Super Highways. The North-\nSouth corridors linking Srinagar (Jammu\n& Kashmir) and Kanniyakumari (Tamil\nNadu), and East-West Corridor\nconnecting Silchar (Assam) and Porbander\n(Gujarat) are part of this project. The\nmajor objective of these Super Highways\nis to reduce the time and distance\nbetween the mega cities of India. These\nhighway projects are being implemented\nby the National Highway Authority of\nIndia (NHAI).\n\ne National Highways: National Highways\nlink extreme parts of the country. These\nare the primary road systems. A number\nof major National Highways run in North-\nSouth and East-West directions.\n\ne State Highways: Roads linking a state\ncapital with different district headquarters\nare known as State Highways.\n\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA — II\n\nFig.7.2: Ahmedabad- Vadodara Expressway\n\nActivity ff.\n\nCollect information of National Highway\nnumbers (old and new) from the website\nmorth.nic.in/national-highway-details. The\nhistorical Sher-Shah Suri Marg between\nDelhi and Amritsar is known by which\nNational Highway ?\n\nDistrict Roads: These roads connect the\ndistrict headquarters with other places of\nthe district.\n\nOther Roads: Rural roads, which link rural\nareas and villages with towns, are classified\nunder this category. These roads received\nspecial impetus under the Pradhan Mantri\nGrameen Sadak Yojana. Under this scheme\nspecial provisions are made so that every\nvillage in the country is linked to a major\ntown in the country by an all season\nmotorable road.\n\nBorder Roads: Apart from these, Border\nRoads Organisation a Government of India\nundertaking constructs and maintains\nroads in the bordering areas of the\ncountry. This organisation was established\nin 1960 for the development of the roads\nof strategic importance in the northern and\nnorth-eastern border areas. These roads\nhave improved accessibility in areas of\ndifficult terrain and have helped in the\neconomic development of these area.\n\n",

Apart from an important\nmeans of transport the Indian Railways\nhave been a great integrating force for more\nthan 150 years. Railways in India bind the\neconomic life of the country as well as\naccelerate the development of the industry\nand agriculture.\n\n8\nThe Indian Railways is the largest public\n\ne sector undertaking in the country. The first\ntrain steamed off from Mumbai to Thane in\n1853, covering a distance of 34 km.\n\nThe Indian Railway is now reorganised into\n17 zones.\n\n- Activity ————+\nFind out the current Railway zones and their\nheadquarters. Also locate the headquarters\nof Railway zones on the map of India.\n\nThe distribution pattern of the Railway\nnetwork in the country has been largely\ninfluenced by physiographic, economic and\nadministrative factors. The northern plains with\ntheir vast level land, high population density\nand rich agricultural resources provided the most\nfavourable condition for their growth. However,\na large number of rivers requiring construction\nof bridges across their wide beds posed some\nobstacles. In the hilly terrains of the peninsular\nregion, railway tracts are laid through low hills,\ngaps or tunnels. The Himalayan mountainous\nregions too are unfavourable for the construction\nof railway lines due to high relief, sparse\npopulation and lack of economic opportunities.\nLikewise, it was difficult to lay railway lines on\nthe sandy plain of western Rajasthan, swamps\nof Gujarat, forested tracks of Madhya Pradesh,\nChhattisgarh, Odisha and Jharkhand. The\ncontiguous stretch of Sahyadri could be crossed\n\n",

It has also faced a\nnumber of problem such as sinking of track in\nsome stretches and landslides.\n\nToday, the railways have become more\nimportant in our national economy than all\nother means of transport put together. However,\nrail transport suffers from certain problems as\nwell. Many passengers travel without tickets.\nThefts and damaging of railway property has\nnot yet stopped completely. People stop the\ntrains, pull the chain unnecessarily and this\ncauses heavy damage to the railway. Think over\nit, how we can help our railway in running as\nper the scheduled time?\n\nPipelines\n\nPipeline transport network is a new arrival on\nthe transportation map of India. In the past,\nthese were used to transport water to cities and\nindustries. Now, these are used for transporting\ncrude oil, petroleum products and natural gas\nfrom oil and natural gas fields to refineries,\nfertilizer factories and big thermal power plants.\nSolids can also be transported through a\npipeline when converted into slurry. The far\ninland locations of refineries like Barauni,\nMathura, Panipat and gas based fertilizer plants\ncould be thought of only because of pipelines.\nInitial cost of laying pipelines is high but\nsubsequent running costs are minimal. It rules\nout trans-shipment losses or delays.\n\nThere are three important networks of\npipeline transportation in the country.\n\ne From oil field in upper Assam to Kanpur\n(Uttar Pradesh), via Guwahati, Barauni and\nPrayagraj. It has branches from Barauni to\nHaldia, via Rajbandh, Rajbandh to\nMaurigram and Guwahati to Siliguri.\n\ne From Salaya in Gujarat to Jalandhar in\nPunjab, via Viramgam, Mathura, Delhi and\nSonipat. It has branches to connect Koyali\n(near Vadodara, Gujarat) Chakshu and\nother places.\n\ne The first 1,700 km long Hazira-Vijaipur-\nJagdishpur (HVJ) cross country gas\npipeline, linked Mumbai High and Bassein\ngas fields with various ferilizer, power and\nindustrial complexes in western and\nnorthern India. Overall, India’s gas pipeline\ninfrastructure has expanded from 1,700 km\nto 18,500 km of cross-country pipelines.\n\nWaterways\n\nSince the ancient period, India was one of the\nseafaring countries. Its seamen sailed far and\nnear, thus, carrying and spreading Indian\ncommerce and culture. Waterways are the\ncheapest means of transport. They are most\nsuitable for carrying heavy and bulky goods. It\nis a fuel-efficient and environment friendly mode\nof transport. India has inland navigation\nwaterways of 14,500 km in length. In order to\ncreate wide waterways network and to promote\ninland water transport in the country as an\neconomical environment friendly\nsupplementary mode of transport to rail and\nroad, 111 inland waterways (including 5\nNational Waterways declared earlier) were\ndeclared as National Waterways (NWs) by the\nNational Waterways Act, 2016.

The syllabi and textbooks developed on\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system\nof education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own\nlearning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must\nrecognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one\nof the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat\nchildren as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of\nknowledge.\n\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode\nof functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour\nin implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of\nteaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for\nteaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook\nproves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather\nthan a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to\naddress the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and\nreorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for\nchild psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook\nattempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space\nto opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small\ngroups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\n\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the\nadvisory committee for textbooks in Social Sciences, at the higher\nsecondary level, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for this\nbook, Professor M.H. Qureshi for guiding the work of this committee.\nSeveral teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are\ngrateful to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nthe institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw\nupon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the\nmembers of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department\nof Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development\nunder the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P.\nDeshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an organisation\ncommitted to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its\nproducts, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to\nundertake further revision and refinement.\n\nDirector\nNew Delhi National Council of Educational\n20 November 2006 Research and Training\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce\ncontent load on students. The National Education Policy 2020,\nalso emphasises reducing the content load and providing\nopportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In\nthis background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to\nrationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes\nalready developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken\ninto consideration in this exercise.\n\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of\nthe following:\n\n° Overlapping with similar content included in other subject\n\nareas in the same class\n\n° Similar content included in the lower or higher class in\nthe same subject\n\ne Difficulty level\n\n° Content, which is easily accessible to students without\nmuch interventions from teachers and can be learned by\nchildren through self-learning or peer-learning\n\n° Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\n\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying\nout the changes given above.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nCHAIRPERSON, ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR TEXTBOOKS IN SOCIAL SCIENCES AT\nTHE SECONDARY LEVEL\n\nHari Vasudevan, Professor, Department of History, University of\nCalcutta, Kolkata\n\nCureEFr ADVISOR\n\nM.

        "text": "The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that\nchildren’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.\nThis principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning\nwhich continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the\nschool, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system\nof education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own\nlearning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must\nrecognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one\nof the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat\nchildren as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of\nknowledge.\n\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode\nof functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour\nin implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of\nteaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for\nteaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook\nproves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather\nthan a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to\naddress the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and\nreorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for\nchild psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook\nattempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space\nto opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small\ngroups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\n\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the\nadvisory committee for textbooks in Social Sciences, at the higher\nsecondary level, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for this\nbook, Professor M.H. Qureshi for guiding the work of this committee.\nSeveral teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are\ngrateful to their principals for making this possible.

Fischer\n\n1064CHO1\n\nonsider the following situations of daily life and think what happens\nwhen —\n\nmilk is left at room temperature during summers.\nan iron tawa/pan/nail is left exposed to humid atmosphere.\n\ngrapes get fermented.\nfood is cooked.\n\nfood gets digested in our body.\n\nwe respire.\n\nIn all the above situations, the nature and the identity of the initial\nsubstance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical\nand chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical\nchange occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place.\nYou may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a\nchemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction\nhas taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to\nthese questions.\n\nCAUTION: This Activity needs\nthe teacher’s assistance. It\nwould be better if students\nwear suitable eyeglasses.\nClean a magnesium ribbon\nabout 3-4 cm long by rubbing\nit with sandpaper.\n\nHold it with a pair of tongs.\nBurn it using a spirit lamp or\nburner and collect the ash so\nformed in a watch-glass as\nshown in Fig. 1.1. Burn the\nmagnesium ribbon keeping it\naway as far as possible from\nyour eyes.\n\nWhat do you observe?\n\nMagnesium\nribbon\n\nWatch-glass\n\nMagnesium\noxide\n\nFigure 1.1\nBurning of amagnesium ribbon in air and collection of magnesium\noxide in a watch-glass\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nYou must have observed that magnesium ribbon burns with a\ndazzling white flame and changes into a white powder. This powder is\nmagnesium oxide. It is formed due to the reaction between magnesium\nand oxygen present in the air.\n\n= Take lead nitrate = Take a few zinc granules in a conical flask or a test tube.\nsolution in a test = Add dilute hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid to this\ntube.

We will study about the various types\nof chemical reactions and their symbolic representation\nDilute sulphuric acid jn this Chapter.\n\nZinc granules\n\nigure 1.2 1.1 CHEMICAL EQUATIONS\n\nFormation ofhydrogen Activity 1.1 can be described as — when a magnesium ribbon is burnt in\ngas by the action of\n\ndilute sulphuricacidon  °XY8EN, it gets converted to magnesium oxide. This description of a\nzinc chemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written ina\nshorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a\nword-equation.\nThe word-equation for the above reaction would be -—\n\nMagnesium + Oxygen — Magnesium oxide (0\n(Reactants) (Product)\n\nThe substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1),\nmagnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is\nmagnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product.\n\nA word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an\narrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand\nside (LHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. Similarly, products are\nwritten on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign (+) between them.\nThe arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of\nthe reaction.\n\nQ Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation\n\nIs there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations?\nChemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use\nchemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a\nchemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and\nmagnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as —\n\nMg+0O, — MgO (1.2)\n\nCount and compare the number of atoms of each element on the\nLHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the\nsame on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not,\nthen the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on\nboth sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal\nchemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the burning of magnesium in air.\n\n1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\n\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class [X; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.\n\nIn other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us\nlearn about balancing a chemical equation step by step.\n\nThe word-equation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as —\n\nZinc + Sulphuric acid — Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen\n\nThe above word-equation may be represented by the following\nchemical equation —\n\nZn + H,SO, > ZnSO, +H, (1.3)\n\nLet us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both\nsides of the arrow.\n\nElement Number of atoms in Number of atoms\nreactants (LHS) in products (RHS)\n\nAs the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of\nthe arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation.\n\nLet us try to balance the following chemical equation —\nBe + HO Fe, + Hi, (1.4)\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nStep I: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each\nformula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the\nequation.\n\n[Fe] + [H,0] + [Fe,0,] + [H] (1.5)\n\nStep II: List the number of atoms of different elements present in the\nunbalanced equation (1.5).\n\nElement Number of atoms Number of atoms\nin reactants (LHS) in products (RHS)\n\nStep III: It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound\nthat contains the maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant ora\nproduct. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum\nnumber of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe,O, and the element\noxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on\nthe LHS.\n\nTo balance the oxygen atoms -—\n\nAtoms of In reactants\noxygen\nww\n\n(i) Initial 1 (in F 4 (in Fe,O,)\n(ii) To palerice J ‘ -~ 4\n\nTo equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we\ncannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the\nreactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient\n‘4’ as 4H,O and not H,O, or (H,O),. Now the partly balanced equation\nbecomes —\n\n¥ 4[H,0] x * (partly balanced eae\n\nStep IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements\nto proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced\nequation.\n\nTo equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules\nof hydrogen as four on the RHS.\n\nAtoms of In reactants In products\nhydrogen\n\n(i) Initial 8 (in 4 H,O) 2 (in H,)\n(ii) To balance 8 2x4\n\nThe equation would be -\n(1.7)\n\n+ 4 7? i 4lH, | (partly balanced equation)\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nStep V: Examine the above equation and pick up the third element\nwhich is not balanced. You find that only one element is left to be\nbalanced, that is, iron.\n\nAtoms of In reactants\niron\n\n(i) Initial 1 (in Fe) 3 (in Fe,O,)\n(ii) To balance 1x3 3\n\nTo equalise Fe, we take three atoms of Fe on the LHS.\n\nStep VI: Finally, to check the correctness of the balanced equation, we\ncount atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.\n\n(1.9)\n\nOFe+ 4110 —+ FeO, +40, (ieienwed equation}\n\nThe numbers of atoms of elements on both sides of Eq. (1.9) are\nequal. This equation is now balanced. This method of balancing chemical\nequations is called hit-and-trial method as we make trials to balance\nthe equation by using the smallest whole number coefficient.\n\nStep VII: Writing Symbols of Physical States Carefully examine\nthe above balanced Eq. (1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about\nthe physical state of each reactant and product? No information has\nbeen given in this equation about their physical states.\n\nTo make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states\nof the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical\nformulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants\nand products are represented by the notations (g), (I), (aq) and (s),\nrespectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product\nis present as a solution in water.\n\nThe balanced Eq.

Nor do atoms\ndisappear from the mixture or appear from elsewhere. Actually, chemical\nreactions involve the breaking and making of bonds between atoms to\nproduce new substances. You will study about types of bonds formed\nbetween atoms in Chapters 3 and 4.\n\n1.2.1 Combination Reaction\n\nBeaker\n\n= Take a small amount of calcium oxide\nor quick lime in a beaker.\nWater = Slowly add water to this.\n= Touch the beaker as shown in Fig. 1.3.\n\ni 2)\nésieiuee. aside Do you feel any change in temperature‘\n\nFigure 1.3\n\nFormation of slaked\nlime by the reaction of\ncalcium oxide with\n\nCalcium oxide reacts vigorously with water to produce slaked lime\n\nwater (calcium hydroxide) releasing a large amount of heat.\nCaO(s) + H,O() — Ca(OH),(aq) + Heat (1.13)\n(Quick lime) (Slaked lime)\n\nIn this reaction, calcium oxide and water combine to form a single\nproduct, calcium hydroxide. Such a reaction in which a single product\nis formed from two or more reactants is known as a combination reaction.\n\n6 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n @®@ ®& ®O OOO GGGOGOHGH QO GOGH ®GD OG ®D ® ®D GQ\n\nDo You Know?\n\nLet us discuss some more examples of combination reactions.\n(i) Burning of coal\n\nC(s) + O,(g) > CO,(g) (1,15)\n(ii) Formation of water from H,(g) and O,(g)\n2H,(g) + O,(g) > 2H,O() (1.16)\n\nIn simple language we can say that when two or more substances\n(elements or compounds) combine to form a single product, the reactions\nare called combination reactions.\n\nIn Activity 1.4, we also observed that a large amount of heat is evolved.\nThis makes the reaction mixture warm. Reactions in which heat is\nreleased along with the formation of products are called exothermic\nchemical reactions.\n\nOther examples of exothermic reactions are —\n\n(i) Burning of natural gas\n\nCH,(g) + 20, (g) 4 CO, (g) + 2H,O (g) (1.17)\n(ii) Do you know that respiration is an exothermic process?\n\nWe all know that we need energy to stay alive. We get this energy\nfrom the food we eat. During digestion, food is broken down into simpler\nsubstances. For example, rice, potatoes and bread contain\ncarbohydrates. These carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose.\nThis glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides\nenergy. The special name of this reaction is respiration, the process of\nwhich you will study in Chapter 6.\n\nC,H,,O0,(aq) + 60, (aq) — 6CO, (aq) + 6H,O()) + energy (1.18)\n(Glucose)\n\n(iii) ‘The decomposition of vegetable matter into compost is also an\nexample of an exothermic reaction.\nIdentify the type of the reaction taking place in Activity 1.1, where\nheat is given out along with the formation of a single product.\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nWafting gas gently\ntowards nose\n\nDo not point\nthe mouth of\nboiling tube\n\nat your neighbours\nor yourself\n\nFigure 1.4\n\nCorrect way of heating\nthe boiling tube\ncontaining crystals\n\nof ferrous sulphate\n\nand of smelling the\nodour\n\nA pair of tongs\n\n1.2.2 Decomposition Reaction\n\n= Take about 2 g ferrous sulphate crystals\nin a dry boiling tube.\n= Note the colour of the ferrous sulphate\n\nBoiling tube crystals.\nr Heat the boiling tube over the flame of\nerrous sulphate\ncrystals a burner or spirit lamp as shown in\nFig. 1.4.\n= Observe the colour of the crystals after\nheating.\n\nHave you noticed that the green colour of the ferrous sulphate crystals\nhas changed?

This is a decomposition reaction. Ferrous\nsulphate crystals (FeSO,. 7H,O) lose water when heated and the colour\nof the crystals changes. It then decomposes to ferric oxide (Fe,O,),\nsulphur dioxide (SO,) and sulphur trioxide (SO,). Ferric oxide is a solid,\nwhile SO, and SO, are gases.\n\nDecomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon\ndioxide on heating is an important decomposition reaction used in\nvarious industries. Calcium oxide is called lime or quick lime. It has\nmany uses — one is in the manufacture of cement. When a decomposition\nreaction is carried out by heating, it is called thermal decomposition.\n\nCaCO,(s) Heat , CaO(s) + CO,(g) (1.20)\n\n(Limestone) (Quick lime)\n\nAnother example of a thermal decomposition reaction is given\nin Activity 1.6.\n\nBoiling tube\n\nLead nitrate\n\n= Take about 2 g lead nitrate powder in a boiling\ntube.\nBurner = Hold the boiling tube with a pair of tongs and\nheat it over a flame, as shown in Fig. 1.5.\n= What do you observe?

The hydrogen is gaining oxygen and is being oxidised.\nIn other words, one reactant gets oxidised while the other gets reduced\nduring a reaction. Such reactions are called oxidation-reduction reactions\nor redox reactions.\n\nOxidation\n\nCuO + H, —., Cu + H,O (1.30)\n\nReduction\nSome other examples of redox reactions are:\n\nZnO +C + Zn+CO (E.31)\nMnO, +4HCl— MnCl, +2H,O+ Cl, (1.32)\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nIn reaction (1.31) carbon is oxidised to CO and ZnO is reduced to Zn.\nIn reaction (1.32) HCl is oxidised to Cl, whereas MnO, is reduced to MnCl.,.\n\nFrom the above examples we can say that ifa substance gains oxygen\nor loses hydrogen during a reaction, it is oxidised. If a substance loses\noxygen or gains hydrogen during a reaction, it is reduced.\n\nRecall Activity 1.1, where a magnesium ribbon burns with a dazzling flame in air (oxygen)\nand changes into a white substance, magnesium oxide. Is magnesium being oxidised or\nreduced in this reaction?\n\n1.3 HAVE YOU OBSERVED THE EFFECTS OF OXIDATION\nREACTIONS IN EVERYDAY LIFE?\n\n1.3.1 Corrosion\n\nYou must have observed that iron articles are shiny when new, but get\ncoated with a reddish brown powder when left for some time. This process\nis commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get\ntarnished in this manner. Have you noticed the colour of the coating\nformed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances\naround it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this\nprocess is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green\ncoating on copper are other examples of corrosion.\n\nCorrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships\nand to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of\niron is a serious problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is\nspent to replace damaged iron. You will learn more about corrosion in\nChapter 3.\n\n1.3.2 Rancidity\n\nHave you ever tasted or smelt the fat/oil containing food materials left\nfor a long time?\n\nWhen fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell\nand taste change. Usually substances which prevent oxidation\n(antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food\nin air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation. Do you know that\nchips manufacturers usually flush bags of chips with gas such as\nnitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised ?\n\nQ U ES TION S$\n\nWhy does the colour of copper sulphate solution change when\nan iron nail is dipped in it?\n\nGive an example of a double displacement reaction other than\nthe one given in Activity 1.10.\n\nIdentify the substances that are oxidised and the substances\nthat are reduced in the following reactions.\n\n(i) 4Na(s) + O,(g) — 2Na,O(s)\n(ii) CuO(s) + H,(g) > Cu(s) + H,OW\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations 13\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nWhat you have learnt\n\nAcomplete chemical equation represents the reactants, products and their physical\nstates symbolically.\n\nA chemical equation is balanced so that the numbers of atoms of each type involved\nin a chemical reaction are the same on the reactant and product sides of the\nequation. Equations must always be balanced.\n\nIn a combination reaction two or more substances combine to form a new single\nsubstance.\n\nDecomposition reactions are opposite to combination reactions. In a decomposition\nreaction, a single substance decomposes to give two or more substances.\n\nReactions in which heat is given out along with the products are called exothermic\nreactions.\n\nReactions in which energy is absorbed are known as endothermic reactions.\n\nWhen an element displaces another element from its compound, a displacement\nreaction occurs.\n\nTwo different atoms or groups of atoms (ions) are exchanged in double displacement\nreactions.\n\nPrecipitation reactions produce insoluble salts.\n\nReactions also involve the gain or loss of oxygen or hydrogen by substances.\nOxidation is the gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen.

        "text": "1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation\n\nIs there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations?\nChemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use\nchemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a\nchemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and\nmagnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as —\n\nMg+0O, — MgO (1.2)\n\nCount and compare the number of atoms of each element on the\nLHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the\nsame on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not,\nthen the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on\nboth sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal\nchemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the burning of magnesium in air.\n\n1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\n\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class [X; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.\n\nIn other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us\nlearn about balancing a chemical equation step by step.\n\nThe word-equation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as —\n\nZinc + Sulphuric acid — Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen\n\nThe above word-equation may be represented by the following\nchemical equation —\n\nZn + H,SO, > ZnSO, +H, (1.3)\n\nLet us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both\nsides of the arrow.\n\nElement Number of atoms in Number of atoms\nreactants (LHS) in products (RHS)\n\nAs the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of\nthe arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation.\n\nLet us try to balance the following chemical equation —\nBe + HO Fe, + Hi, (1.4)\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases.\n\nIn this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life.\n\nDo You Know?\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n1064CHO2\n\n\n\nQ U ES TION\n\nYou have been provided with three test tubes. One of them contains\n\ndistilled water and the other two contain an acidic solution and a basic\nsolution, respectively. If you are given only red litmus paper, how will\nyou identify the contents of each test tube?\n\n2.1 UNDERSTANDING THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF\nACIDS AND BASES\n\n2.1.1 Acids and Bases in the Laboratory\n\n= Collect the following solutions from the science laboratory-—\nhydrochloric acid (HCl), sulphuric acid (H,SO,), nitric acid (HNO,),\nacetic acid (CH,COOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), calcium\nhydroxide [Ca(OH),], potassium hydroxide (KOH), magnesium\nhydroxide [Mg(OH),], and ammonium hydroxide (NH,OH).\n\n= Put a drop of each of the above solutions on a watch-glass one by\none and test with a drop of the indicators shown in Table 2.1.\n\n= What change in colour did you observe with red litmus, blue litmus,\nphenolphthalein and methyl orange solutions for each of the\nsolutions taken?\n\n= Tabulate your observations in Table 2.1.\n\nTable 2.1\n\nSample Red Blue Phenolph- Methyl\nsolution litmus litmus -thalein orange\nsolution solution solution solution\n\nThese indicators tell us whether a substance is acidic or basic by\nchange in colour. There are some substances whose odour changes in\nacidic or basic media. These are called olfactory indicators. Let us try\nout some of these indicators.\n\n= Take some finely chopped onions in a plastic bag along with some\nstrips of clean cloth. Tie up the bag tightly and leave overnight in\nthe fridge. The cloth strips can now be used to test for acids and\nbases.\n\n= Take two of these cloth strips and check their odour.\n\n= Keep them on a clean surface and put a few drops of dilute HCl\nsolution on one strip and a few drops of dilute NaOH solution on\nthe other.\n\n18 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n= Rinse both cloth strips with water and again check their odour.\n\n= Note your observations.\n\n= Now take some dilute vanilla essence and clove oil and check their\nodour.\n\n= Take some dilute HCl solution in one test tube and dilute NaOH\nsolution in another. Add a few drops of dilute vanilla essence to\nboth test tubes and shake well. Check the odour once again and\nrecord changes in odour, if any.\n\n= Similarly, test the change in the odour of clove oil with dilute HCl\nand dilute NaOH solutions and record your observations.\n\nWhich of these — vanilla, onion and clove, can be used as olfactory\nindicators on the basis of your observations?\n\nLet us do some more activities to understand the chemical properties\nof acids and bases.\n\n2.1.2 How do Acids and Bases React with Metals?\n\nCAUTION: This activity needs the teacher’s assistance.\n\n= Set the apparatus as shown in Fig. 2.1.\n\n= Take about 5 mL of dilute sulphuric acid in a test tube and adda\nfew pieces of zinc granules to it.\n\n= What do you observe on the surface of zinc granules?\n\n= Pass the gas being evolved through the soap solution.\n\n= Why are bubbles formed in the soap solution?\n\n= Take a burning candle near a gas filled bubble.\n\n= What do you observe?\n\n= Repeat this Activity with some more acids like HCl, HNO, and\n\nCH,COOH.\n\nAre the observations in all the cases the same or different?\n\nDelivery tube\n\nStand\nBurning of hydrogen\n. gas with a pop sound\nCandle\nTest tube ° te\nrogen\nDilute wl acee\nsulphuric Wa bubbles\n; acid O—— Soap bubble filled\nZinc granules with hydrogen\n\noo\n[eXe)\n[o)\nSoap\nsolution\n\nFigure 2.1 Reaction of zinc granules with dilute sulphuric acid and testing hydrogen\ngas by burning\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts 19\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nNote that the metal in the above reactions displaces hydrogen atoms\nfrom the acids as hydrogen gas and forms a compound called a salt.\nThus, the reaction of a metal with an acid can be summarised as —\n\nAcid + Metal > Salt + Hydrogen gas\n\nCan you now write the equations for the reactions you have observed?\n\nActivity 2.4\n\n= Place a few pieces of granulated zinc metal in a test tube.\n\n= Add 2 mL of sodium hydroxide solution and warm the contents\nof the test tube.\n\n= Repeat the rest of the steps as in Activity 2.3 and record your\nobservations.\n\nThe reaction that takes place can be written as follows.\n\n2NaOH{(aq) + Zn(s) > Na,ZnO,(s) + H,(g)\n\n(Sodium zincate)\n\nYou find again that hydrogen is formed in the reaction. However,\nsuch reactions are not possible with all metals.\n\n2.1.3 How do Metal Carbonates and Metal\n\nThistle funnel\n\nStand\nCork\n\n= Take two test tubes, label them as A\nand B.\n\n= Take about 0.5 g of sodium carbonate\n(Na,CO,) in test tube A and about\n0.5 g of sodium hydrogencarbonate\n(NaHCO,) in test tube B.\n\n= Add about 2 mL of dilute HCl to both\nthe test tubes.\n\n= What do you observe?\n\n= Pass the gas produced in each case\nthrough lime water (calcium\n\nee\n\nhydroxide\nsolution\n\nFigure 2.2 hydroxide solution) as shown in\nPassing carbon dioxide gas Fig. 2.2 and record your observations.\nthrough calcium hydroxide\n\nsolution\n\nThe reactions occurring in the above Activity are written as —\n\nTest tube A: Na,CO,(s) + 2HCl(aq) ~ 2NaCl(aq) + H,O(l) + CO, (g)\nTest tube B: NaHCO, (s) + HCl(aq) ~ NaCl(aq) + H,O(l) + CO,(g)\nOn passing the carbon dioxide gas evolved through lime water,\n\nCa(OH), (aq) + CO, (g) > CaCO,(s) + H,O()\n(Lime water) (White precipitate)\n\n20 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nOn passing excess carbon dioxide the following reaction takes place:\nCaCO,(s)+ H,O(l)+ CO,(g) — Ca(HCO,), (aq)\n\n(Soluble in water)\n\nLimestone, chalk and marble are different forms of calcium carbonate.\nAll metal carbonates and hydrogencarbonates react with acids to give a\ncorresponding salt, carbon dioxide and water.\n\nThus, the reaction can be summarised as —\n\nMetal carbonate/Metal hydrogencarbonate + Acid > Salt + Carbon dioxide + Water\n\n2.1.4 How do Acids and Bases React with each other?\n\n= Take about 2 mL of dilute NaOH solution in a test tube and add\ntwo drops of phenolphthalein solution.\n\nWhat is the colour of the solution?\n\nAdd dilute HCl solution to the above solution drop by drop.\n\nIs there any colour change for the reaction mixture?\n\nWhy did the colour of phenolphthalein change after the addition\nof an acid?\n\n= Now add a few drops of NaOH to the above mixture.\n\n= Does the pink colour of phenolphthalein reappear?\n\n= Why do you think this has happened?\n\nIn the above Activity, we have observed that the effect of a base is\nnullified by an acid and vice-versa. The reaction taking place is written as —\n\nNaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) — NaCl(aq) + H,O())\n\nThe reaction between an acid and a base to give a salt and water is\nknown as a neutralisation reaction. In general, a neutralisation reaction\ncan be written as —\n\nBase + Acid > Salt + Water\n\n2.1.5 Reaction of Metallic Oxides with Acids\n\n= Take a small amount of copper oxide in a beaker and add dilute\nhydrochloric acid slowly while stirring.\n\n= Note the colour of the solution. What has happened to the copper\noxide?\n\nYou will notice that the colour of the solution becomes blue-green\nand the copper oxide dissolves. The blue-green colour of the solution is\ndue to the formation of copper(II) chloride in the reaction. The general\nreaction between a metal oxide and an acid can be written as -\n\nMetal oxide + Acid — Salt + Water\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n21\n\n\nNow write and balance the equation for the above reaction. Since\nmetallic oxides react with acids to give salts and water, similar to the\nreaction of a base with an acid, metallic oxides are said to be basic oxides.\n\n2.1.6 Reaction of a Non-metallic Oxide with Base\n\nYou saw the reaction between carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide\n(lime water) in Activity 2.5. Calcium hydroxide, which is a base, reacts\nwith carbon dioxide to produce a salt and water. Since this is similar to\nthe reaction between a base and an acid, we can conclude that non-\nmetallic oxides are acidic in nature.\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nWhy should curd and sour substances not be kept in brass and copper\nvessels?\n\nWhich gas is usually liberated when an acid reacts with a metal?\n\nIllustrate with an example. How will you test for the presence of\nthis gas?\n\nMetal compound A reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to produce\neffervescence. The gas evolved extinguishes a burning candle., Write a\nbalanced chemical equation for the reaction if one of the compounds\nformed is calcium chloride.\n\n2.2 WHAT DO ALL ACIDS AND ALL BASES HAVE IN\nCOMMON?\n\nIn Section 2.1 we have seen that all acids have similar chemical\nproperties. What leads to this similarity in properties? We saw in Activity\n2.3 that all acids generate hydrogen gas on reacting with metals, so\nhydrogen seems to be common to all acids. Let us perform an Activity to\ninvestigate whether all compounds containing hydrogen are acidic.\n\nActivity 2.8\nBulb\nGvulitiatie— 74) . = Take solutions of glucose, alcohol,\n\n7 Switch hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, etc.\n\n= Fix two nails on a cork, and place the cork in\na 100 mL beaker.\n\nBeaker = Connect the nails to the two terminals of a\n6 volt battery through a bulb and a switch, as\nshown in Fig. 2.3.\n\n= Now pour some dilute HCl in the beaker and\n\nNail\n\nDilute HCl switch on the current.\n\nsolution = Repeat with dilute sulphuric acid.\n\nRubber = What do you observe?\n\n= Repeat the experiment separately with\nFigure 2.3 glucose and alcohol solutions. What do you\nAcid solution in water observe now?\nconducts electricity = Does the bulb glow in all cases?\n22 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nThe bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in Fig. 2.3.\nBut you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct\nelectricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric\ncurrent through the solution. The electric current is carried through the\nacidic solution by ions.\n\nAcids contain H* ion as cation and anion such as Cl in HCl, NO; in\nHNO,, SO% in H,SO,, CH,COO- in CH,COOH. Since the cation present in\nacids is H*, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H*(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties.\n\nRepeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity?\n\n2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution?\n\nDo acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this.\n\n= Take about lg solid NaCl in a clean and Dropper\ndry test tube and set up the apparatus as containing\nshown in Fig. 2.4. ie CL\n\n= Add some concentrated sulphuric acid to ‘\n\nthe test tube. A pair of tongs\n= What do you observe? Is there a gas coming ee\nout of the delivery tube? | Q\n\na\n\nDelivery tube\nCork\n\n\\<—— Test Tube\n\nae A pair of tongs\n\n= Test the gas evolved successively with dry \"Test Tube.\nand wet blue litmus paper. bedi Le\n= In which case does the litmus paper change chloride\n\ncolour?\n= On the basis of the above Activity, what do\nyou infer about the acidic character of:\n(i) dry HCl gas\n(ii) HCl solution?\n\nGuard tube containing\ncalcium chloride\n\nFigure 2.4 Preparation of HCl gas\n\nNote to teachers: If the climate is very humid, you will have to pass the gas produced\nthrough a guard tube (drying tube) containing calcium chloride to dry the gas.\n\nThis experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced\nin the presence of water. The separation of H* ion from HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water.\n\nHCl + H,O > HO* + Cr\n\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH*(aq) or hydronium ion (H,O*).\n\nH* + H,O 9H,O*\n\nWe have seen that acids give H,O* or H*(aq) ion in water. Let us see\nwhat happens when a base is dissolved in water.\n\nNaOH(s)__2°_, Na* (aq) + OH (aq)\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n23\n\n\nDo You\nKnow?\n\nFigure 2.5\n\nKOH(s) oe ae K* (aq) + OH\" (aq)\nMg(OH),(s) _42° _, Mg?*(aq)+2O0H (aq)\n\nBases generate hydroxide (OH) ions in water. Bases which are soluble\nin water are called alkalis.\n\nAll bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They\n\nare soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis?\n\nNow as we have identified that all acids generate H*(aq) and all\nbases generate OH (aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows —\n\nAcid + Base > Salt + Water\nH OH > MX + HOH\nH*(aq) + OH (aq) — H,O())\n\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\n\n= Take 10 mL water in a beaker.\n\n= Add a few drops of concentrated H,SO, to it and swirl the\nbeaker slowly.\n\nTouch the base of the beaker.\n\nIs there a change in temperature?\n\nIs this an exothermic or endothermic process?\n\nRepeat the above Activity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations.\n\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\n\nconcentrated acids and\n\nbases\n\n24\n\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns.\nThe glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in Fig. 2.5) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets.\n\nMixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H,0*/OH) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nWhy do HCl, HNO,, etc., show acidic characters in aqueous solutions\nwhile solutions of compounds like alcohol and glucose do not show acidic\ncharacter?\n\nWhy does an aqueous solution of an acid conduct electricity?\nWhy does dry HCl gas not change the colour of the dry litmus paper?\n\nWhile diluting an acid, why is it recommended that the acid should be\nadded to water and not water to the acid?\n\nHow is the concentration of hydronium ions (H,O*) affected when a\nsolution of an acid is diluted?\n\nHow is the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH) affected when excess\nbase is dissolved in a solution of sodium hydroxide?\n\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\n\nWe know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H* or OH ions in solutions.\nCan we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution?\nCan we judge how strong a given acid or base is?\n\nWe can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.\n\nAscale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\nPH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\nO (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.\n\nThe pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.\n\nNeutral\nAcidic nature increasing 7 Basic nature increasing\n\n* he . . ot .\nIncrease in H ion concentration —— —————_> Decrease in H ion concentration\n\nFigure 2.6 Variation of pH with the change in concentration of H*(aq) and OH(aq) ions\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts 25\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nTable 2.2\n\nSolution Colour of | Approx- | Nature of\nsubstance\n\n= Test the pH values\nof solutions given in\nMables2e2,\n\n= Record your observations.\n\n= What is the nature of each\nsubstance on the basis of\nyour observations?\n\nf ot f I f\n\nGastric Lemon juice Pure water, Milk of Sodium\njuice (about 2.2) blood magnesia hydroxide\n(about1.2) (7.4) (10) solution\n(about 14)\n\nFigure 2.7 pH of some common substances shown on a pH paper (colours are only a rough guide)\n\nThe strength of acids and bases depends on the number of H* ions\nand OH ions produced, respectively. If we take hydrochloric acid and\nacetic acid of the same concentration, say one molar, then these produce\ndifferent amounts of hydrogen ions. Acids that give rise to more H* ions\nare said to be strong acids, and acids that give less H* ions are said to be\nweak acids. Can you now say what weak and strong bases are?\n\n2.3.1 Importance of pH in Everyday Life\n\nAre plants and animals pH sensitive?\n\nOur body works within the pH range of 7.0 to 7.8. Living organisms can\nsurvive only in a narrow range of pH change. When pH of rain water is\nless than 5.6, it is called acid rain. When acid rain flows into the rivers, it\nlowers the pH of the river water. The survival of aquatic life in such rivers\nbecomes difficult.\n\n26 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nAcids in other planets\n\nThe atmosphere of venus is made up of thick white and yellowish clouds of\n\nsulphuric acid. Do you think life can exist on this planet?\n\nWhat is the pH of the soil in your backyard?\n\nPlants require a specific pH range for their healthy growth. To find out\nthe pH required for the healthy growth ofa plant, you can collect the soil\nfrom various places and check the pH in the manner described below in\nActivity 2.12. Also, you can note down which plants are growing in the\nregion from which you have collected the soil.\n\nPut about 2 g soil in a test tube and add 5 mL water to it.\n\nShake the contents of the test tube.\n\nFilter the contents and collect the filtrate in a test tube.\n\nCheck the pH of this filtrate with the help of universal\nindicator paper.\n\n= What can you conclude about the ideal soil pH for the growth of\nplants in your region?\n\npH in our digestive system\n\nIt is very interesting to note that our stomach produces hydrochloric\nacid. It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach.\nDuring indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes\npain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called\nantacids. One such remedy must have been suggested by you at the\nbeginning of this Chapter. These antacids neutralise the excess acid.\nMagnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for\nthis purpose.\n\npH change as the cause of tooth decay\n\nTooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth\nenamel, made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form of calcium\nphosphate) is the hardest substance in the body. It does not dissolve in\nwater, but is corroded when the pH in the mouth is below 5.5. Bacteria\npresent in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food\nparticles remaining in the mouth after eating. The best way to prevent\nthis is to clean the mouth after eating food. Using toothpastes, which are\ngenerally basic, for cleaning the teeth can neutralise the excess acid and\nprevent tooth decay.\n\nSelf defence by animals and plants through chemical warfare\nHave you ever been stung by a honey-bee? Bee-sting leaves an acid\nwhich causes pain and irritation. Use of a mild base like baking soda\non the stung area gives relief. Stinging hair of nettle leaves inject\nmethanoic acid causing burning pain.\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n27\n\n\nDo You Know?\n\n@® @®\n\nTable 2.3 Some naturally occurring acids\n\nNatural source Natural source\n\n28\n\nYou have two solutions, A and B.

Let us understand more about their preparation,\n\nproperties and uses.\n\n2.4.1 Family of Salts\n\n= Write the chemical formulae of the salts given below.\n\nPotassium sulphate, sodium sulphate, calcium sulphate,\nmagnesium sulphate, copper sulphate, sodium chloride, sodium\n\nnitrate, sodium carbonate and ammonium chloride.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience\n\n\n= Identify the acids and bases from which the above salts may be\nobtained.\n\n= Salts having the same positive or negative radicals are said to\nbelong to a family. For example, NaCl and Na,SO, belong to the\nfamily of sodium salts. Similarly, NaCl and KCl belong to the family\nof chloride salts. How many families can you identify among the\nsalts given in this Activity?\n\n2.4.2 pH of Salts\n\n= Collect the following salt samples - sodium chloride, potassium\nnitrate, aluminium chloride, zinc sulphate, copper sulphate,\nsodium acetate, sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogencarbonate\n(some other salts available can also be taken).\n\n= Check their solubility in water (use distilled water only).\n\n= Check the action of these solutions on litmus and find the pH\nusing a pH paper.\n\n= Which of the salts are acidic, basic or neutral?\n\n= Identify the acid or base used to form the salt.\n\n= Report your observations in Table 2.4.\n\nSalts of a strong acid and a strong base Table 2.4\n\nare neutral with pH value of 7. On the other :\n\nhand, salts of a strong acid and weak base Acid used | Base used\nare acidic with pH value less than 7 and those\n\nof a strong base and weak acid are basic in\n\nnature, with pH value more than 7.\n\n2.4.3 Chemicals from Common Salt\n\nBy now you have learnt that the salt formed\nby the combination of hydrochloric acid and\nsodium hydroxide solution is called sodium\nchloride. This is the salt that you use in food.\nYou must have observed in the above Activity\nthat it is a neutral salt.\n\nSeawater contains many salts dissolved\nin it. Sodium chloride is separated from these\nsalts. Deposits of solid salt are also found in\nseveral parts of the world. These large crystals\nare often brown due to impurities. This is\ncalled rock salt. Beds of rock salt were formed\nwhen seas of bygone ages dried up. Rock salt\nis mined like coal.\n\nYou must have heard about Mahatma Gandhi’s Dandi March. Did\nyou know that sodium chloride was such an important symbol in our\nstruggle for freedom?\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts 29\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nCommon salt — A raw material for chemicals\n\nThe common salt thus obtained is an important raw material for various\nmaterials of daily use, such as sodium hydroxide, baking soda, washing\nsoda, bleaching powder and many more. Let us see how one substance\nis used for making all these different substances.\n\nSodium hydroxide\n\nWhen electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium\nchloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. The\nprocess is called the chlor-alkali process because of the products formed-\nchlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.\n\n2NaCl(aq) + 2H,O(l) — 2NaOH{(aq) + Cl,(g) + H,(g)\n\nChlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode.\nSodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. The three\nproducts produced in this process are all useful. Figure 2.8 shows the\ndifferent uses of these products.\n\nCla\n(Water treatment, swimming pools,\nPVC, disinfectants, CFCs,\npesticides)\n\nHa\n| (Fuels, margarine, ammonia\n\nfor fertilisers)\n\nAnode i) Ac) Cathode\n\na Brine containing\n———> NaOH\n\n(De-greasing metals, soaps and\ndetergents, paper making,\n\n—\nS artificial fibres)\n\nMembrane\n\nFigure 2.8 Important products from the chlor-alkali process\n\nBleaching powder\n\nYou have already come to know that chlorine is produced during the\nelectrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (brine). This chlorine gas is used\nfor the manufacture of bleaching powder. Bleaching powder is produced\nby the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH),]. Bleaching powder\nis represented as Ca(ClO),, though the actual composition is quite\ncomplex.\n\n2Ca(OH), + 2Cl, > Ca(ClO), + CaCl, + 2H,O\n\n30 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nBleaching powder is used -\n\n(i) for bleaching cotton and linen in the textile industry, for bleaching\nwood pulp in paper factories and for bleaching washed clothes\nin laundry;\n\n(ii) as an oxidising agent in many chemical industries; and\n(iii) to make drinking water free from germs.\n\nBaking soda\n\nThe baking soda is commonly used in the kitchen for making tasty crispy\npakoras, etc. Sometimes it is added for faster cooking. The chemical\nname of the compound is sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO,). It is\nproduced using sodium chloride as one of the raw materials.\n\nNaCl + H,O + CO, + NH, — NH,Cl + NaHCO,\n(Ammonium (Sodium\nchloride) hydrogencarbonate)\n\nDid you check the pH of sodium hydrogencarbonate in Activity 2.14?\nCan you correlate why it can be used to neutralise an acid? It is a mild\nnon-corrosive basic salt. The following reaction takes place when it is\nheated during cooking —\n\n2NaHco, —Heat_, Na,co, +H,O+CO,\n\n(Sodium (Sodium\nhydrogencarbonate) carbonate)\n\nSodium hydrogencarbonate has got various uses in the household.\n\nUses of Baking soda\n\n(i) For making baking powder, which is a mixture of baking soda\n(sodium hydrogencarbonate) and a mild edible acid such as\ntartaric acid. When baking powder is heated or mixed in water,\nthe following reaction takes place -—\n\nNaHCO,+H* —- CO; +H,O + Sodium salt of acid\n(From any acid)\n\nCarbon dioxide produced during the reaction can cause bread or\n\ncake to rise making them soft and spongy.\n\n(ii) Sodium hydrogencarbonate is also an ingredient in antacids.\nBeing alkaline, it neutralises excess acid in the stomach and\nprovides relief.\n\n(iii) It is also used in soda-acid fire extinguishers.\n\nWashing soda\n\nAnother chemical that can be obtained from sodium chloride is\nNa,CO,.10H,O (washing soda). You have seen above that sodium\ncarbonate can be obtained by heating baking soda; recrystallisation of\nsodium carbonate gives washing soda. It is also a basic salt.\n\nNa,CO, + 10H,O>Na,CO3.10H,O\n(Sodium\ncarbonate)\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n31\n\n\nFigure 2.9\nRemoving water\nof crystallisation\n\n32\n\nWhat does 10H,0 signify? Does it make Na,CO, wet? We will address\nthis question in the next section.\n\nSodium carbonate and sodium hydrogencarbonate are useful\nchemicals for many industrial processes as well.\n\nUses of washing soda\n(i) Sodium carbonate (washing soda) is used in glass, soap and\npaper industries.\n(ii) Itis used in the manufacture of sodium compounds such as borax.\n(iii) Sodium carbonate can be used as a cleaning agent for domestic\npurposes.\n(iv) It is used for removing permanent hardness of water.\n\n2.4.4 Are the Crystals of Salts really Dry?\n\n= Heat a few crystals of copper sulphate\nin a dry boiling tube.\n\n= What is the colour of the copper\nsulphate after heating?\n\nCopper sulphate cystals = Do you notice water droplets in the\nboiling tube? Where have these come\nfrom?\n\n= Add 2-3 drops of water on the sample\nof copper sulphate obtained after\nheating.\n\n= What do you observe? Is the blue\ncolour of copper sulphate restored?\n\nA pair of tongs\nBoiling tube\nWater droplets\n\nCopper sulphate crystals which seem to be dry contain water of\ncrystallisation. When we heat the crystals, this water is removed and the\nsalt turns white.\n\nIf you moisten the crystals again with water, you will find that blue\ncolour of the crystals reappears.\n\nWater of crystallisation is the fixed number of water molecules present\nin one formula unit of a salt. Five water molecules are present in one\nformula unit of copper sulphate. Chemical formula for hydrated copper\nsulphate is Cu SO,. 5H,O. Now you would be able to answer the question\nwhether the molecule of Na,CO,.10H,O is wet.\n\nOne other salt, which possesses water of crystallisation is gypsum.\nIt has two water molecules as water of cyrstallisation. It has the chemical\nformula CaSO,.2H,O. Let us look into the use of this salt.\n\nPlaster of Paris\nOn heating gypsum at 373 K, it loses water molecules and becomes\n\n1\ncalcium sulphate hemihydrate (CaSO, 3 H,O). This is called Plaster of\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nParis, the substance which doctors use as plaster for supporting\nfractured bones in the right position. Plaster of Paris is a white powder\nand on mixing with water, it changes to gypsum once again giving a\nhard solid mass.\n\nCaSO, 5 H,O + 15 H,0 CaSO, .2H,O\n(Plaster of Paris) (Gypsum)\n\nNote that only half a water molecule is shown to be attached as water\nof crystallisation. How can you get half a water molecule? It is written in\nthis form because two formula units of CaSO, share one molecule of\nwater. Plaster of Paris is used for making toys, materials for decoration\nand for making surfaces smooth. Try to find out why is calcium sulphate\nhemihydrate called ‘Plaster of Paris’ ?\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nWhat is the common name of the compound Ca(Cl1O),?\n\nName the substance which on treatment with chlorine yields bleaching\npowder.\n\nName the sodium compound which is used for softening hard water.\n\nWhat will happen if a solution of sodium hydrocarbonate is heated?\nGive the equation of the reaction involved.\n\nWrite an equation to show the reaction between Plaster of Paris and\nwater.\n\nWhat you have learnt\n\nAcid-base indicators are dyes or mixtures of dyes which are used to indicate the\npresence of acids and bases.\n\nAcidic nature of a substance is due to the formation of H*(aq) ions in solution.\nFormation of OH (aq) ions in solution is responsible for the basic nature of a\nsubstance.\n\nWhen an acid reacts with a metal, hydrogen gas is evolved and a corresponding\nsalt is formed.\n\nWhen a base reacts with a metal, along with the evolution of hydrogen gas a salt is\nformed which has a negative ion composed of the metal and oxygen.\n\nWhen an acid reacts with a metal carbonate or metal hydrogencarbonate, it gives\nthe corresponding salt, carbon dioxide gas and water.\n\nAcidic and basic solutions in water conduct electricity because they produce\nhydrogen and hydroxide ions respectively.\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts 33\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nThe strength of an acid or an alkali can be tested by using a scale called the pH\nscale (0-14) which gives the measure of hydrogen ion concentration in a solution.\n\nA neutral solution has a pH of exactly 7, while an acidic solution has a pH less\nthan 7 and a basic solution a pH more than 7.\n\nLiving beings carry out their metabolic activities within an optimal pH range.\nMixing concentrated acids or bases with water is a highly exothermic process.\nAcids and bases neutralise each other to form corresponding salts and water.\n\nWater of crystallisation is the fixed number of water molecules present in one formula\nunit of a salt.\n\nSalts have various uses in everyday life and in industries.\n\n.

Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns.\nThe glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in Fig. 2.5) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets.\n\nMixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H,0*/OH) per unit volume.

We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H* or OH ions in solutions.\nCan we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution?\nCan we judge how strong a given acid or base is?\n\nWe can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.\n\nAscale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\nPH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\nO (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.\n\nThe pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6).

To find out\nthe pH required for the healthy growth ofa plant, you can collect the soil\nfrom various places and check the pH in the manner described below in\nActivity 2.12. Also, you can note down which plants are growing in the\nregion from which you have collected the soil.\n\nPut about 2 g soil in a test tube and add 5 mL water to it.\n\nShake the contents of the test tube.\n\nFilter the contents and collect the filtrate in a test tube.\n\nCheck the pH of this filtrate with the help of universal\nindicator paper.\n\n= What can you conclude about the ideal soil pH for the growth of\nplants in your region?\n\npH in our digestive system\n\nIt is very interesting to note that our stomach produces hydrochloric\nacid. It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach.\nDuring indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes\npain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called\nantacids. One such remedy must have been suggested by you at the\nbeginning of this Chapter. These antacids neutralise the excess acid.\nMagnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for\nthis purpose.\n\npH change as the cause of tooth decay\n\nTooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth\nenamel, made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form of calcium\nphosphate) is the hardest substance in the body. It does not dissolve in\nwater, but is corroded when the pH in the mouth is below 5.5. Bacteria\npresent in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food\nparticles remaining in the mouth after eating. The best way to prevent\nthis is to clean the mouth after eating food. Using toothpastes, which are\ngenerally basic, for cleaning the teeth can neutralise the excess acid and\nprevent tooth decay.\n\nSelf defence by animals and plants through chemical warfare\nHave you ever been stung by a honey-bee? Bee-sting leaves an acid\nwhich causes pain and irritation. Use of a mild base like baking soda\non the stung area gives relief.

For performing Activities 3.1 to 3.6, collect the samples of\nfollowing metals — iron, copper, aluminium, magnesium, sodium, lead,\nzinc and any other metal that is easily available.\n\nActivity 3.1\n\n= Take samples of iron, copper, aluminium and magnesium. Note\nthe appearance of each sample.\n\n= Clean the surface of each sample by rubbing them with sand paper\nand note their appearance again.\n\nMetals, in their pure state, have a shining surface. This property is\ncalled metallic lustre.\n\n= Take small pieces of iron, copper, aluminium, and magnesium.\nTry to cut these metals with a sharp knife and note your\nobservations.\n\n= Hold a piece of sodium metal with a pair of tongs.\nCAUTION: Always handle sodium metal with care. Dry it by\npressing between the folds of a filter paper.\nPut it on a watch-glass and try to cut it with a knife.\n\n= What do you observe?\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n1064CHO3\n\n\nYou will find that metals are generally hard. The hardness varies\nfrom metal to metal.\n\n= Take pieces of iron, zinc, lead and copper.\n\n= Place any one metal on a block of iron and strike it four or five\ntimes with a hammer. What do you observe?\n\n= Repeat with other metals.\n\n= Record the change in the shape of these metals.\n\nYou will find that some metals can be beaten into thin sheets. This\nproperty is called malleability. Did you know that gold and silver are the\nmost malleable metals?\n\n= List the metals whose wires you have seen in daily life.\n\nThe ability of metals to be drawn into thin wires is called ductility.\nGold is the most ductile metal. You will be surprised to know that a wire\nof about 2 km length can be drawn from one gram of gold.\n\nIt is because of their malleability and ductility that metals can be\ngiven different shapes according to our needs.\n\nCan you name some metals that are used for making cooking vessels?\nDo you know why these metals are used for making vessels? Let us do\nthe following Activity to find out the answer.\n\nwire. Clamp this wire on a\nGrecend of wire stand, as shown in Fig. 3.1.\n; = Fix a pin to the free end of the\nwire using wax.\n= Heat the wire with a spirit lamp,\ncandle or a burner near the\nplace where it is clamped.\n= What do you observe after some\ntime?\n= Note your observations. Does\nthe metal wire melt?\n\nStand | Noa yy = Take an aluminium or copper\n\nClamp\n\nFigure 3.1\n\nMetals are good\nconductors of heat. The above activity shows that metals are good conductors of heat\n\nand have high melting points. The best conductors of heat are silver and\ncopper. Lead and mercury are comparatively poor conductors of heat.\n\nDo metals also conduct electricity? Let us find out.\n\n38 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nA Pi eee |\nActiv\n\n= Set up an electric circuit as shown in Fig. 3.2.\n\n= Place the metal to be tested in the circuit\nbetween terminals A and B as shown.\n\n= Does the bulb glow? What does this indicate?\n\nInsert sample\nto be tested\n\nYou must have seen that the wires that carry current\nin your homes have a coating of polyvinylchloride (PVC)\nor a rubber-like material. Why are electric wires coated Figure 3.2\nwith such substances? Metals are good\n\nWhat happens when metals strike a hard surface? Do they produce conductors of electricity.\na sound? The metals that produce a sound on striking a hard surface\nare said to be sonorous. Can you now say why school bells are made of\nmetals?\n\n3.1.2 Non-metals\n\nIn the previous Class you have learnt that there are very few non-metals\nas compared to metals. Some of the examples of non-metals are carbon,\nsulphur, iodine, oxygen, hydrogen, etc. The non-metals are either solids\nor gases except bromine which is a liquid.\n\nDo non-metals also have physical properties similar to that of metals?\nLet us find out.\n\nWare\nActi’\n\n= Collect samples of carbon (coal or graphite), sulphur and iodine.\n= Carry out the Activities 3.1 to 3.4 and 3.6 with these non-metals\nand record your observations.\n\nCompile your observations regarding metals and non-metals in Table 3.1.\n\nTable 3.1\n\nElement |Symbol | Type of Malleability | Ductility Conducts Sonority\nsurface Electricity\n\nOn the bases of the observations recorded in Table 3.1, discuss the\ngeneral physical properties of metals and non-metals in the class. You\nmust have concluded that we cannot group elements according to their\nphysical properties alone, as there are many exceptions. For example —\n\n(i) All metals except mercury exist as solids at room temperature.\nIn Activity 3.5, you have observed that metals have high melting\n\nMetals and Non-metals 39\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\npoints but gallium and caesium have very low melting points.\nThese two metals will melt if you keep them on your palm.\n(ii) Iodine is a non-metal but it is lustrous.\n\n(iii) Carbon is a non-metal that can exist in different forms. Each\nform is called an allotrope. Diamond, an allotrope of carbon, is\nthe hardest natural substance known and has a very high melting\nand boiling point. Graphite, another allotrope of carbon, is a\nconductor of electricity.\n\n(iv) Alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium) are so soft that they\ncan be cut with a knife. They have low densities and low melting\npoints.\n\nElements can be more clearly classified as metals and non-metals\non the basis of their chemical properties.\n\nTake a magnesium ribbon and some sulphur powder.\n\nBurn the magnesium ribbon. Collect the ashes formed and dissolve\nthem in water.\n\n= Test the resultant solution with both red and blue litmus paper.\nIs the product formed on burning magnesium acidic or basic?\nNow burn sulphur powder. Place a test tube over the burning\nsulphur to collect the fumes produced.\n\nAdd some water to the above test tube and shake.\n\nTest this solution with blue and red litmus paper.\n\nIs the product formed on burning sulphur acidic or basic?\n\nCan you write equations for these reactions?\n\nMost non-metals produce acidic oxides when dissolve in water. On\nthe other hand, most metals, give rise to basic oxides. You will be learning\nmore about these metal oxides in the next section.\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nGive an example of a metal which\n(i) is a liquid at room temperature.\n\n(ii) can be easily cut with a knife.\n\n(iii) is the best conductor of heat.\n(iv) is a poor conductor of heat.\nExplain the meanings of malleable and ductile.\n\n3.2 CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF METALS\n\nWe will learn about the chemical properties of metals in the following\nSections 3.2.1 to 3.2.4. For this, collect the samples of following metals —\naluminium, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, zinc and sodium.\n\n40 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n3.2.1 What happens when Metals are burnt in Air?\n\nYou have seen in Activity 3.8 that magnesium burns in air with a dazzling\nwhite flame. Do all metals react in the same manner? Let us check by\nperforming the following Activity.\n\nCAUTION: The following activity needs the teacher’s assistance.\nIt would be better if students wear eye protection.\n= Hold any of the samples taken above with a pair of tongs and try\nburning over a flame. Repeat with the other metal samples.\nCollect the product if formed.\nLet the products and the metal surface cool down.\nWhich metals burn easily?\nWhat flame colour did you observe when the metal burnt?\nHow does the metal surface appear after burning?\nArrange the metals in the decreasing order of their reactivity\ntowards oxygen.\n= Are the products soluble in water?\n\nAlmost all metals combine with oxygen to form metal oxides.\nMetal + Oxygen — Metal oxide\n\nFor example, when copper is heated in air, it combines with oxygen\nto form copper(II) oxide, a black oxide.\n\n2Cu + O, ~ 2CuO\n(Copper) (Copper(II) oxide)\n\nSimilarly, aluminium forms aluminium oxide.\n\n4Al  — +_: 30, > 2A1,0;\n\n(Aluminium) (Aluminium oxide)\n\nRecall from Chapter 2, how copper oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid.\nWe have learnt that metal oxides are basic in nature. But some metal\noxides, such as aluminium oxide, zinc oxide show both acidic as well as\nbasic behaviour. Such metal oxides which react with both acids as well as\nbases to produce salts and water are known as amphoteric oxides.\nAluminium oxide reacts in the following manner with acids and bases —\n\nAl,O,+6HCl .—> 2AICl, + 3H,O\nAl,O, + 2NaOH. > 2NaAlO, + H,O\n\n(Sodium\naluminate)\n\nMost metal oxides are insoluble in water but some of these dissolve\nin water to form alkalis. Sodium oxide and potassium oxide dissolve in\nwater to produce alkalis as follows -\n\nNa,O(s) + H,O() ~ 2NaOH{(aq)\nK,O(s) + H,O(l) ~ 2KOH{(aq)\n\nMetals and Non-metals 41\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nDo You Know?\n\n42\n\nWe have observed in Activity 3.9 that all metals do not react with\noxygen at the same rate. Different metals show different reactivities\ntowards oxygen. Metals such as potassium and sodium react so\nvigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them\nand to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil.\nAt ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium,\naluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The\nprotective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron\ndoes not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled\nin the flame of the burner. Copper does not burn, but the hot metal is\ncoated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do\nnot react with oxygen even at high temperatures.\n\nAfter performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium\nis the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of\nmagnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium.\nBut burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of\nzinc, iron, copper or lead. Let us see Some more reactions to arrive ata\nconclusion about the order of reactivity of these metals.\n\n3.2.2 What happens when Metals react with Water?\n\nCAUTION: This Activity needs the teacher’s assistance.\n= Collect the samples of the same metals as in Activity 3.9.\n\n= Put small pieces of the samples separately in beakers half-filled\nwith cold water.\n\n= Which metals reacted with cold water? Arrange them in the\nincreasing order of their reactivity with cold water.\n\n= Did any metal produce fire on water?\n= Does any metal start floating after some time?\n\n= Put the metals that did not react with cold water in beakers\nhalf-filled with hot water.\n\n= For the metals that did not react with hot water, arrange the\napparatus as shown in Fig. 3.3 and observe their reaction with steam.\n\n= Which metals did not react even with steam?\n= Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with water.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nGlass-wool\n\nsoaked in <— Stand\nwater\n\nHydrogen gas\n\nMetal sample\n\nBurner\n\nDelivery —>\ntube\n\nFigure 3.3 Action of steam on a metal\n\nMetals react with water and produce a metal oxide and hydrogen\ngas. Metal oxides that are soluble in water dissolve in it to further form\nmetal hydroxide. But all metals do not react with water.\n\nMetal + Water — Metal oxide + Hydrogen\nMetal oxide + Water — Metal hydroxide\n\nMetals like potassium and sodium react violently with cold water. In\ncase of sodium and potassium, the reaction is so violent and exothermic\nthat the evolved hydrogen immediately catches fire.\n\n2K(s) + 2H,O(l) ~ 2KOH(aq) + H,(g)+ heat energy\n2Na(s) + 2H,O()) —~ 2NaOH(aq) + H,(g) + heat energy\n\nThe reaction of calcium with water is less violent. The heat evolved is\nnot sufficient for the hydrogen to catch fire.\n\nCa(s) + 2H,O(l) > Ca(OH),(aq) + H,(g)\n\nCalcium starts floating because the bubbles of hydrogen gas formed\nstick to the surface of the metal.\n\nMagnesium does not react with cold water. It reacts with hot water\nto form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen. It also starts floating due\nto the bubbles of hydrogen gas sticking to its surface.\n\nMetals like aluminium, iron and zinc do not react either with cold or\nhot water. But they react with steam to form the metal oxide and hydrogen.\n\n2A\\(s) + 3H,0(8) 3° Al,O,(s) + 3H,(g)\n3Fe(s) + 4H,O(g) > Fe,O,(s) + 4H,(g)\n\nMetals such as lead, copper, silver and gold do not react with water at all.\n\n3.2.3 What happens when Metals react with Acids?\n\nYou have already learnt that metals react with acids to give a salt and\nhydrogen gas.\n\nMetals and Non-metals 43\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nDo You Know?\n\n44\n\nMetal + Dilute acid — Salt + Hydrogen\nBut do all metals react in the same manner? Let us find out.\n\n= Collect all the metal samples except sodium and potassium again.\nIf the samples are tarnished, rub them clean with sand paper.\nCAUTION: Do not take sodium and potassium as they react\nvigorously even with cold water.\n\n= Put the samples separately in test tubes containing dilute\nhydrochloric acid.\n\n= Suspend thermometers in the test tubes, so that their bulbs are\n\ndipped in the acid.\n\nObserve the rate of formation of bubbles carefully.\n\nWhich metals reacted vigorously with dilute hydrochloric acid?\n\nWith which metal did you record the highest temperature?\n\nArrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with dilute\n\nacids.\n\nWrite equations for the reactions of magnesium, aluminium, zinc\nand iron with dilute hydrochloric acid.\n\nHydrogen gas is not evolved when a metal reacts with nitric acid. It is\nbecause HNO, is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises the H, produced to\nwater and itself gets reduced to any of the nitrogen oxides (N,O, NO,\nNO,). But magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) react with very dilute\nHNO, to evolve H, gas.\n\nYou must have observed in Activity 3.11, that the rate of formation\nof bubbles was the fastest in the case of magnesium. The reaction was\nalso the most exothermic in this case. The reactivity decreases in the\norder Mg > Al > Zn > Fe. In the case of copper, no bubbles were seen and\nthe temperature also remained unchanged. This shows that copper does\nnot react with dilute HCl.\n\nO-®\n\n3.2.4 How do Metals react with Solutions of other Metal\nSalts?\n\n= Take a clean wire of copper and an iron nail.\n\n= Put the copper wire in a solution of iron sulphate and the iron\nnail in a solution of copper sulphate taken in test tubes (Fig. 3.4).\n\n= Record your observations after 20 minutes.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n= In which test tube did you find that a reaction has occurred?\n= On what basis can you say that a reaction has actually taken\n\nplace?\n\n= Can you correlate your observations for the Activities 3.9, 3.10\n\nand 3.11?\n\n= Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction that has taken\n\nplace.\n= Name the type of reaction.\n\nReactive metals can displace less\nreactive metals from their compounds in\nsolution or molten form.\n\nWe have seen in the previous sections\nthat all metals are not equally reactive. We\nchecked the reactivity of various metals\nwith oxygen, water and acids. But all\nmetals do not react with these reagents.\nSo we were not able to put all the metal\nsamples we had collected in decreasing\norder of their reactivity. Displacement\nreactions studied in Chapter 1 give better\nevidence about the reactivity of metals. It\nis simple and easy if metal A displaces\n\nmetal B from its solution, it is more reactive than B.\n\nCork\nThread\nTest tube\nstand\nTest tube\nIron nail Copper wire\nCopper Iron sulphate\nsulphate solution\nsolution\n\nIron nail\n\nFigure 3.4\nReaction of metals with\n\nMetal A + Salt solution of B > Salt solution of A + Metal B salt solutions\n\nWhich metal, copper or iron, is more reactive according to your\n\nobservations in Activity 3.12?\n\n3.2.5 The Reactivity Series\n\nThe reactivity series is a list of metals arranged in the order of their\ndecreasing activities. After performing displacement experiments\n(Activities 1.9 and 3.12), the following series, (Table 3.2) known as the\nreactivity or activity series has been developed.\n\nTable 3.2 Activity series : Relative reactivities of metals\n\nK Potassium Most reactive\nNa Sodium\n\nCa Calcium\n\nMg Magnesium\n\nAl Aluminium\n\nZn Zinc Reactivity decreases\nFe Iron\n\nPb Lead\n\n[H] [Hydrogen]\n\nCul Copper\n\nHg Mercury\n\nAg Silver\n\nAu Gold Least reactive\n\nMetals and Non-metals\n\n45\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nQ UES TION S\n\nWhy is sodium kept immersed in kerosene oil?\nWrite equations for the reactions of\n\n(i) iron with steam\n\n(ii) calcium and potassium with water\n\nSamples of four metals A, B, C and D were taken and added to the\nfollowing solution one by one.

Write the chemical reaction that takes place.\n\n3.3 HOW DO METALS AND NON-METALS REACT?\n\nIn the above activities, you saw the reactions of metals with a number of\nreagents. Why do metals react in this manner? Let us recall what we\nlearnt about the electronic configuration of elements in Class IX. We\nlearnt that noble gases, which have a completely filled valence shell, show\nlittle chemical activity. We, therefore, explain the reactivity of elements\nas a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell.\n\nLet us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and\nsome metals and non-metals.\n\nWe can see from Table 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electron in its\noutermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell\nnow becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet. The nucleus\nof this atom still has 11 protons but the number of electrons has\nbecome 10, so there is a net positive charge giving us a sodium cation\nNa‘. On the other hand chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shell\n\n46 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nTable 3.3 Electronic configurations of some elements\n\nType of Element Atomic Number of\nelement number electrons in shells\nK M N\n\nand it requires one more electron to complete its octet. Ifsodium and chlorine\nwere to react, the electron lost by sodium could be taken up by chlorine.\nAfter gaining an electron, the chlorine atom gets a unit negative charge,\nbecause its nucleus has 17 protons and there are 18 electrons in its K, L\nand M shells. This gives us a chloride anion C1-. So both these elements\ncan have a give-and-take relation between them as follows (Fig. 3.5).\n\nNa— Na’ +e\n\n296,1 2,8\n\n(Sodium cation)\n\nCl +e 53 Cr\n2,84 2,8,8\n(Chloride anion)\n\nNe xe\nxCl x\nae\n\nNa + xCl x > (Na’*)\n\nFigure 3.5 Formation of sodium chloride\n\nSodium and chloride ions, being oppositely charged, attract each\nother and are held by strong electrostatic forces of attraction to exist as\nsodium chloride (NaCl). It should be noted that sodium chloride does\nnot exist as molecules but aggregates of oppositely charged ions.\n\nLet us see the formation of one more ionic compound, magnesium\nchloride (Fig. 3.6).\n\nMetals and Non-metals\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n47\n\n\nMg —— Mg” + 2e7\n\n25852 2,8\n(Magnesium cation)\n\nFigure 3.6 Formation of magnesium chloride\n\nThe compounds formed in this manner by the transfer of electrons\nfrom a metal to a non-metal are known as ionic compounds or\nelectrovalent compounds. Can you name the cation and anion present\nin MgCl,?\n\n3.3.1 Properties of lonic Compounds\n\nTo learn about the properties of ionic compounds, let us perform the\nfollowing Activity:\n\nSpatula\ncontaining sample\n\n= Take samples of sodium chloride, potassium iodide, barium\nchloride or any other salt from the science laboratory.\n\n= What is the physical state of these salts?\n\n= Take a small amount of a sample on a metal spatula and\nheat directly on the flame (Fig. 3.7). Repeat with other samples.\n\n= What did you observe? Did the samples impart any colour\nto the flame? Do these compounds melt?\n\n= Try to dissolve the samples in water, petrol and kerosene.\n\nFigure 3.7 Are they soluble?\nHeating a, salt sample ona = Make a circuit as shown in Fig. 3.8 and insert the electrodes\nspatula into a solution of one salt. What did you observe?

These compounds are generally brittle and\nbreak into pieces when pressure is applied.\n\n(ii) Melting and Boiling points: Ionic compounds have high melting\nand boiling points (see Table 3.4). This is because a considerable\namount of energy is required to break the strong inter-ionic\nattraction.\n\n(iii) Solubility: Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in\nwater and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc.\n\n(iv) Conduction of Electricity: The conduction of electricity through\na solution involves the movement of charged particles. A solution\nof an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the\nopposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the\nsolution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct\nelectricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible\ndue to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct\nelectricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten state\nsince the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely\ncharged ions are overcome due to the heat. Thus, the ions move\nfreely and conduct electricity.\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\n(i) Write the electron-dot structures for.sodium, oxygen and\nmagnesium.\n\n(ii) Show the formation of Na,O and MgO by the transfer of electrons.\n\n(iii) What are the ions present in these compounds?\nWhy do ionic compounds have high melting points?\n\n3.4 OCCURRENCE OF METALS\n\nThe earth’s crust is the major source of metals. Seawater also contains\nsome soluble salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, etc.\nThe elements or compounds, which occur naturally in the earth’s crust,\nare known as minerals. At some places, minerals contain a very high\npercentage of a particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted\nfrom it. These minerals are called ores.\n\n3.4.1 Extraction of Metals\n\nYou have learnt about the reactivity series of metals. Having this\nknowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its\nore. Some metals are found in the earth’s crust in the free state. Some\nare found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of\nthe activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free\n\nMetals and Non-metals 49\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nK\nNa\nCa Electrolysis\nMg\nAl\nzn\nFe\nReduction using\nPb carbon\nCu\nAg Found in native\nA state\nFigure 3.9\n\nActivity series and\nrelated metallurgy\n\n50\n\nstate. For example, gold, silver, platinum and copper are found in the\nfree state. Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as\ntheir sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series\n(K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are never found in\nnature as free elements. The metals in the middle of the activity series\n(Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth’s\ncrust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. You will find that\nthe ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very\nreactive element and is very abundant on the earth.\n\nThus on the basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the\nfollowing three categories (Fig. 3.9) — (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals\nof medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity. Different techniques\nare to be used for obtaining the metals falling in each category.\n\nSeveral steps are involved in the extraction of pure metal from\nores. A summary of these steps is given in Fig.3.10. Each step is\nexplained in detail in the following sections.\n\nOre\n\nConcentration of ore\n\nMetals Metals of Metals of\nof high medium low\nreactivity reactivity reactivity\nElectrolysis of | | Sulphide\nmolten ore ores\nCarbonate Sulphide\nore ore\nPure metal | | Roasting\nCalcination Roasting\nMetal\nOxide of metal |\nRefining\n\nReduction to\nmetal\n\nPurification of\nmetal\n\nFigure 3.10 Steps involved in the extraction of metals from ores\n\n3.4.2 Enrichment of Ores\n\nOres mined from the earth are usually contaminated with large amounts\nof impurities such as soil, sand, etc., called gangue. The impurities must\nbe removed from the ore prior to the extraction of the metal. The processes\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nused for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences\nbetween the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore.\nDifferent separation techniques are accordingly employed.\n\n3.4.3 Extracting Metals Low in the Activity Series\n\nMetals low in the activity series are very unreactive. The oxides of these\nmetals can be reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar\n(HgS) is an ore of mercury. When it is heated in air, it is first converted\ninto mercuric oxide (HgO). Mercuric oxide is then reduced to mercury\non further heating.\n\n2HgS\\(s) + 30,(g) Heat, 2Hg0\\(s) + 2S0,(g)\n\n2Hg0(s) Heat _, 2Hg(1) + 0,(g)\nSimilarly, copper which is found as Cu,S in nature can be obtained\nfrom its ore by just heating in air.\n\n2Cu,S + 30, (g)—H&t 5 2Cu, O(s) + 280, (g)\n2Cu,O + Cu,S —Heat_,6cu(s) + SO, (g)\n\n3.4.4 Extracting Metals in the Middle of the Activity Series\n\nThe metals in the middle of the activity series such as iron, zinc, lead,\ncopper, are moderately reactive. These are usually present as sulphides\nor carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as\ncompared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction,\nthe metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal\noxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly\nin the presence of excess air. This process is known as roasting. The\ncarbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited\nair. This process is known as calcination. The chemical reaction that\ntakes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown\nas follows —\n\nRoasting\n27nS(s) + 30, (g) He2t  27n0(s) + 280, (g)\nCalcination\n\nZnCO, (s) Heat_, znO(s) +CO, (g)\n\nThe metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by\nusing suitable reducing agents such as carbon. For example, when zinc\noxide is heated with carbon, it is reduced to metallic zinc.\n\nZnO(s) + C(s) > Zn(s) + CO(g)\n\nYou are already familiar with the process of oxidation and reduction\nexplained in the first Chapter. Obtaining metals from their compounds\nis also a reduction process.\n\nBesides using carbon (coke) to reduce metal oxides to metals,\nsometimes displacement reactions can also be used.

The anode is impure copper,\nwhereas, the cathode is a strip of pure\n\nagents because they can displace metals of lower reactivity from their\ncompounds.

The\namount of heat evolved is so large that the metals are produced\nin the molten state. In fact, the reaction of iron(II) oxide (Fe,O,)\nwith aluminium is used to join railway tracks or cracked\nmachine parts.

They cannot\nbe obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example,\ncarbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium,\naluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals\nhave more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained\nby electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium\nare obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals\nare deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas,\nchlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode). The\nreactions are —\n\nAt cathode Nat+e + Na\nAt anode 2Cl~a > Cl, + 2e7-\n\nSimilarly, aluminium is obtained by the electrolytic reduction of\naluminium oxide.\n\n3.4.6 Refining of Metals\n\nThe metals produced by various reduction processes\nAcidified | described above are not very pure.

The galvanised article is\nprotected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you\nreason this out?\n\nAlloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal.\nWe can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is\nthe most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is\nbecause pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, ifit is\nmixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard\nand strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get\nstainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed\nwith some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties\nof any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance.\nThe substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a\nhomogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-\nmetal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then,\ndissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled\nto room temperature.\n\n® @®O ®DOdqoOOGdGQOOdOdODDOD ODO @O© @© DG OD OOOO ®O © @®© ®O® ®© ® ®O ®D\n\nDo You Know?\n\nIf one of the metals is mercury, then the alloy is known as an\namalgam. The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is\nless than that of pure metals. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and\nzine (Cu and Zn), and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and Sn), are\nnot good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making\nelectrical circuits. Solder, an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low\nmelting point and is used for welding electrical wires together.\n\n54 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nMetallic oxides of zinc, magnesium and copper were heated with the\nfollowing metals.\n\nMagnesium | Copper\n\nIn which cases will you find displacement reactions taking place?\nWhich metals do not corrode easily?\n\nWhat are alloys?\n\nWhat you have learnt\n\nElements can be classified as metals and non-metals.\n\nMetals are lustrous, malleable, ductile and are good conductors of heat and\nelectricity.

We\nlearnt that noble gases, which have a completely filled valence shell, show\nlittle chemical activity. We, therefore, explain the reactivity of elements\nas a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell.\n\nLet us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and\nsome metals and non-metals.\n\nWe can see from Table 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electron in its\noutermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell\nnow becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet. The nucleus\nof this atom still has 11 protons but the number of electrons has\nbecome 10, so there is a net positive charge giving us a sodium cation\nNa‘. On the other hand chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shell\n\n46 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

These compounds are generally brittle and\nbreak into pieces when pressure is applied.\n\n(ii) Melting and Boiling points: Ionic compounds have high melting\nand boiling points (see Table 3.4). This is because a considerable\namount of energy is required to break the strong inter-ionic\nattraction.\n\n(iii) Solubility: Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in\nwater and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc.\n\n(iv) Conduction of Electricity: The conduction of electricity through\na solution involves the movement of charged particles. A solution\nof an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the\nopposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the\nsolution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct\nelectricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible\ndue to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct\nelectricity in the molten state.

These minerals are called ores.\n\n3.4.1 Extraction of Metals\n\nYou have learnt about the reactivity series of metals. Having this\nknowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its\nore. Some metals are found in the earth’s crust in the free state. Some\nare found in the form of their compounds.

For example, gold, silver, platinum and copper are found in the\nfree state. Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as\ntheir sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series\n(K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are never found in\nnature as free elements. The metals in the middle of the activity series\n(Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth’s\ncrust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. You will find that\nthe ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very\nreactive element and is very abundant on the earth.\n\nThus on the basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the\nfollowing three categories (Fig. 3.9) — (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals\nof medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity. Different techniques\nare to be used for obtaining the metals falling in each category.\n\nSeveral steps are involved in the extraction of pure metal from\nores.

The oxides of these\nmetals can be reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar\n(HgS) is an ore of mercury. When it is heated in air, it is first converted\ninto mercuric oxide (HgO).

These are usually present as sulphides\nor carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as\ncompared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction,\nthe metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal\noxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly\nin the presence of excess air. This process is known as roasting. The\ncarbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited\nair. This process is known as calcination. The chemical reaction that\ntakes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown\nas follows —\n\nRoasting\n27nS(s) + 30, (g) He2t  27n0(s) + 280, (g)\nCalcination\n\nZnCO, (s) Heat_, znO(s) +CO, (g)\n\nThe metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by\nusing suitable reducing agents such as carbon.

The galvanised article is\nprotected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you\nreason this out?\n\nAlloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal.\nWe can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is\nthe most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is\nbecause pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, ifit is\nmixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard\nand strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get\nstainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed\nwith some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties\nof any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance.\nThe substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a\nhomogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-\nmetal.

In this Chapter we will study about some more interesting\ncompounds and their properties. Also, we shall be learning about carbon,\nan element which is of immense significance to us in both its elemental\nform and in the combined form.\n\nThings made | Things made | Others\nof metal of glass/clay\n\nAree A 1\nActivity 4.1\n\nMake a list of ten things you have used\nor consumed since the morning.\nCompile this list with the lists made by\nyour classmates and then sort the items\ninto the adjacent Table.\n\nIf there are items which are made up of\nmore than one material, put them into\nboth the relevant columns of the table.\n\nLook at the items that come in the last column of the above table\nfilled by you — your teacher will be able to tell you that most of them are\nmade up of compounds of carbon. Can you think of a method to test\nthis? What would be the product if a compound containing carbon is\nburnt? Do you know of any test to confirm this?\n\nFood, clothes, medicines, books, or many of the things that you listed\nare all based on this versatile element carbon. In addition, all living\nstructures are carbon based. The amount of carbon present in the earth’s\ncrust and in the atmosphere is quite meagre. The earth’s crust has only\n0.02% carbon in the form of minerals (like carbonates, hydrogen-\ncarbonates, coal and petroleum) and the atmosphere has 0.03% of carbon\ndioxide. In spite of this small amount of carbon available in nature, the\nimportance of carbon seems to be immense. In this Chapter, we will know\nabout the properties of carbon which make carbon so important to us.\n\n4.1 BONDING IN CARBON - THE COVALENT BOND\n\nIn the previous Chapter, we have studied the properties of ionic\ncompounds. We saw that ionic compounds have high melting and boiling\npoints and conduct electricity in solution or in the molten state. We also\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nsaw how the nature of bonding in ionic compounds explains these\nproperties. Let us now study the properties of some carbon compounds.\nMost carbon compounds are poor conductors of electricity as we\nhave seen in Chapter 2. From the data\ngiven in Table 4.1 on the boiling and Table 4.1 Melting points and boiling points of some\n\nmelting points of the carbon compounds, compounds of carbon\nwe find that these compounds have low : a\nP 57.4 ; Compound Melting Boiling\nmelting and boiling points as compared ; :\n. point (K) | point (K)\nto ionic compounds (Chapter 3). We can\nconclude that the forces of attraction — Acetic acid (CH,COOH) 290 391\n\nbetween the molecules are not very\nstrong. Since these compounds are\nlargely non-conductors of electricity, we | Ethanol (CH,CH,OH) 156 351\ncan conclude that the bonding in these\ncompounds does not give rise to any ions.\n\nIn Class IX, we learnt about the\ncombining capacity of various elements and how it depends on the\nnumber of valence electrons. Let us now look at the electronic\nconfiguration of carbon. The atomic number of carbon is 6. What would\nbe the distribution of electrons in various shells of carbon? How many\nvalence electrons will carbon have?\n\nWe know that the reactivity of elements is explained as their tendency\nto attain a completely filled outer shell, that is, attain noble gas\nconfiguration. Elements forming ionic compounds achieve this by either\ngaining or losing electrons from the outermost shell. In the case of carbon,\nit has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs to gain or lose four\nelectrons to attain noble gas configuration. If it were to gain or lose\nelectrons —\n\nChloroform (CHCI,) 209 334\n\nMethane (CH,) 90 111\n\n(i) It could gain four electrons forming C* anion. But it would be difficult\nfor the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons, that is,\nfour extra electrons.\n\n(ii) It could lose four electrons forming C** cation. But it would require\na large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a\ncarbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two\nelectrons.\n\nCarbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with\nother atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements. Not just carbon,\nbut many other elements form molecules by sharing electrons in this\nmanner. The shared electrons ‘belong’ to the outermost shells of both\nthe atoms and lead to both atoms attaining the noble gas configuration.\nBefore going on to compounds of carbon, let us look at some simple\nmolecules formed by the sharing of valence electrons.\n\nThe simplest molecule formed in this manner is that of hydrogen.\nAs you have learnt earlier, the atomic number of hydrogen is 1. Hence\nhydrogen has one electron in its K shell and it requires one more electron\nto fill the K shell. So two hydrogen atoms share their electrons to form a\nmolecule of hydrogen, H,. This allows each hydrogen atom to attain the\n\nCarbon and its Compounds 59\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nFigure 4.1\nA molecule of hydrogen\n\nFigure 4.2\nSingle bond between\ntwo hydrogen atoms\n\nxX ».@.4\nx\nOx\n\nxX XxX\n\nO=O\n\nFigure 4.3\nDouble bond between\ntwo oxygen atoms\n\nx\n\nx\nNx\n\na\n\nFigure 4.4\nTriple bond between\ntwo nitrogen atoms\n\n60\n\nH, molecule\n\nShared electrons\n\n= O Oxygen atoms\n\n} O, molecule\n\nos\nXNYy Nitrogen atoms\nx x\n\n} N, molecule\n\nelectronic configuration of the nearest noble gas,\nhelium, which has two electrons in its K shell. We can\ndepict this using dots or crosses to represent valence\nelectrons (Fig. 4.1).\n\nThe shared pair of electrons is said to constitute a\nsingle covalent bond between the two hydrogen atoms.\nA single covalent bond is also represented by a line\nbetween the two atoms, as shown in Fig. 4.2.\n\nThe atomic number of chlorine is 17. What would be its electronic\nconfiguration and its valency? Chlorine forms a diatomic molecule, Cl,.\nCan you draw the electron dot structure for this molecule? Note that\nonly the valence shell electrons need to be depicted.\n\nIn the case of oxygen, we see the formation of a double bond between\ntwo oxygen atoms. This is because an atom of oxygen has six electrons\nin its L shell (the atomic number of oxygen is eight) and it requires two\nmore electrons to complete its octet. So each atom of oxygen shares two\nelectrons with another atom of oxygen to give us the structure shown in\nFig. 4.3. The two electrons contributed by each oxygen atom give rise to\ntwo shared pairs of electrons. This is said to constitute a double bond\nbetween the two atoms.\n\nCan you now depict a molecule of water showing the nature\nof bonding between one oxygen atom and two hydrogen\natoms? Does the molecule have single bonds or double bonds?\n\nWhat would happen in the case of a diatomic molecule of\nnitrogen? Nitrogen has the atomic number 7. What would be\nits electronic configuration and its combining capacity? In\norder to attain an octet, each nitrogen atom in a molecule of\nnitrogen contributes three electrons giving rise to three shared\npairs of electrons. This is said to constitute a triple bond\nbetween the two atoms. The electron dot structure of N, and\nits triple bond can be depicted as in Fig. 4.4.\n\nAmolecule of ammonia has the formula NH,. Can you draw\nthe electron dot structure for this molecule showing how all\nfour atoms achieve noble gas configuration? Will the molecule\nhave single, double or triple bonds?\n\nLet us now take a look at methane, which is a compound\nof carbon. Methane is widely used as a fuel and is a major\ncomponent of bio-gas and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). It\nis also one of the simplest compounds formed by carbon.\nMethane has a formula CH,. Hydrogen, as you know, has a\nvalency of 1. Carbon is tetravalent because it has four valence\nelectrons. In order to achieve noble gas configuration, carbon\nshares these electrons with four atoms of hydrogen as shown\nin Fig. 4.5.\n\nSuch bonds which are formed by the sharing of an electron pair\nbetween two atoms are known as covalent bonds. Covalently bonded\nmolecules are seen to have strong bonds within the molecule, but inter-\nmolecular forces are weak. This gives rise to the low melting and boiling\n\nHydrogen atoms\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\npoints of these compounds. Since the electrons are shared between\natoms and no charged particles are formed, such covalent compounds\nare generally poor conductors of electricity.\n\nAllotropes of carbon\nThe element carbon occurs in different forms in nature with\nwidely varying physical properties. Both diamond and\ngraphite are formed by carbon atoms, the difference lies in\nthe manner in which the carbon atoms are bonded to one\n\n: : Figure 4.5\nanother. In diamond, each carbon atom is bonded to four Electron dot structure for\nother carbon atoms forming a rigid three-dimensional methane\n\nstructure. In graphite, each carbon atom is bonded to three\nother carbon atoms in the same plane giving a hexagonal array.\nOne of these bonds is a double-bond, and thus the valency of\ncarbon is satisfied. Graphite structure is formed by the\nhexagonal arrays being placed in layers one above the other.\n\nThe structure of diamond The structure of graphite The structure of C-60\nBuckminsterfullerene\n\nMore to Know!\n\nThese two different structures result in diamond and graphite having very different\nphysical properties even though their chemical properties are the same. Diamond is\nthe hardest substance known while graphite is smooth and slippery. Graphite is also\navery good conductor of electricity unlike other non-metals that you studied in the\nprevious Chapter.\n\nDiamonds can be synthesised by subjecting pure carbon to very high pressure and\ntemperature. These synthetic diamonds are small but are otherwise indistinguishable\nfrom natural diamonds.\n\nFullerenes form another class of carbon allotropes. The first one to be identified was\nC-60 which has carbon atoms arranged in the shape of a football. Since this looked\nlike the geodesic dome designed by the US architect Buckminster Fuller, the molecule\nwas named fullerene.\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nWhat would be the electron dot structure of carbon dioxide which has\n\nthe formula CO,?\n\nWhat would be the electron dot structure of a molecule of sulphur which\nis made up of eight atoms of sulphur? (Hint - The eight atoms of sulphur\nare joined together in the form of a ring.)\n\nCarbon and its Compounds 61\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n62\n\n4.2 VERSATILE NATURE OF CARBON\n\nWe have seen the formation of covalent bonds by the sharing of\nelectrons in various elements and compounds. We have also seen the\nstructure of a simple carbon compound, methane. In the beginning\nof the Chapter, we saw how many things we use contain carbon. In\nfact, we ourselves are made up of carbon compounds. The numbers\nof carbon compounds whose formulae are known to chemists was\nrecently estimated to be in millions! This outnumbers by a large\nmargin the compounds formed by all the other elements put together.\nWhy is it that this property is seen in carbon and no other element?\nThe nature of the covalent bond enables carbon to form a large number\nof compounds. Two factors noticed in the case of carbon are -\n\n(i) Carbon has the unique ability to form bonds with other atoms of\ncarbon, giving rise to large molecules. This property is called\ncatenation. These compounds may have long chains of carbon,\nbranched chains of carbon or even carbon atoms arranged in rings.\nIn addition, carbon atoms may be linked by single, double or triple\nbonds. Compounds of carbon, which are linked by only single\nbonds between the carbon atoms are called saturated compounds.\nCompounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between their\ncarbon atoms are called unsaturated compounds.\n\nNo other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent\nseen in carbon compounds. Silicon forms compounds with\nhydrogen which have chains of upto seven or eight atoms, but these\ncompounds are very reactive. The carbon-carbon bond is very strong\nand hence stable. This gives us the large number of compounds\nwith many carbon atoms linked to each other.\n\n(ii) Since carbon has a valency of four, it is capable of bonding with\nfour other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other mono-valent\nelement. Compounds of carbon are formed with oxygen, hydrogen,\nnitrogen, sulphur, chlorine and many other elements giving rise to\ncompounds with specific properties which depend on the elements\nother than carbon present in the molecule.\n\nAgain the bonds that carbon forms with most other elements are\nvery strong making these compounds exceptionally stable. One\nreason for the formation of strong bonds by carbon is its small size.\nThis enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons\nstrongly. The bonds formed by elements having bigger atoms are\nmuch weaker.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nMore to Know!\n\n4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds\n\nWe have already seen the structure of methane. Another compound\nformed between carbon and hydrogen is ethane with a formula of C,H,.\nIn order to arrive at the structure of simple carbon\ncompounds, the first step is to link the carbon atoms\ntogether with a single bond (Fig. 4.6a) and then use the\nhydrogen atoms to satisfy the remaining valencies of carbon\n(Fig. 4.6b). For example, the structure of ethane is arrived\nin the following steps —\n\nCc—C Step 1\nFigure 4.6 (a) Carbon atoms linked together with a single bond\n\nThree valencies of each carbon atom remain unsatisfied,\n\nso each is bonded to three hydrogen atoms giving: Figure 4.6\nHH (c) Electron dot structure of\nrs ethane\nBOs Step 2\nH H\n\nFigure 4.6 (b) Each carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms\nThe electron dot structure of ethane is shown in Fig. 4.6(c).\n\nCan you draw the structure of propane, which has the molecular C=C Step 1\nformula C,H, in a similar manner? You will see that the valencies of all\nthe atoms are satisfied by single bonds between them. Such carbon\ncompounds are called saturated compounds. These compounds are\nnormally not very reactive.\n\nHowever, another compound of carbon and hydrogen has the formula Pn ~ a,\n\nC,H, and is called ethene. How can this molecule be depicted? We follow  H H Step 2\nthe same step-wise approach as above.\n\nCarbon-carbon atoms linked together with a single bond (Step 1).\n\nWe see that one valency per carbon atom remains unsatisfied cH na\n(Step 2). This can be satisfied only if there is a double bond between the / -N\\ Step 3\ntwo carbons (Step 3). H H\n\nCarbon and its Compounds 63\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nThe electron dot structure for ethene is given in Fig. 4.7.\nYet another compound of hydrogen and carbon has the formula\nC,H, and is called ethyne. Can you draw the electron dot\nstructure for ethyne? How many bonds are necessary between\nthe two carbon atoms in order to satisfy their valencies? Such\ncompounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between\nthe carbon atoms are known as unsaturated carbon compounds\nand they are more reactive than the saturated carbon\ncompounds.\n\nFigure 4.7\nSietuiredfethene 4.2.2 Chains, Branches and Rings\n\nIn the earlier section, we mentioned the carbon compounds methane,\nethane and propane, containing respectively 1, 2 and 3 carbon atoms.\nSuch ‘chains’ of carbon atoms can contain many more carbon atoms.\nThe names and structures of six of these are given in Table 4.2.\n\nTable 4.2 Formulae and structures of saturated compounds of carbon and hydrogen\nNo. of C Structure\natoms\nJel\n\n|\nIl Methane CH Ay “i\n\n4 |\nH\nae\n2 Ethane Gait HOC “C -H\nH H\nca\nSo Propane Cin HG te OC =I8l\nJet Jal JBI\neee\n4 Butane CH ee\nH H H H\nee Py\n5 Pentane CH H o 0 o © C H\n\n6 Hexane (Jal H-C-C\n\n64 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nBut, let us take another look at butane. If we make the carbon\n‘skeleton’ with four carbon atoms, we see that two different possible\n‘skeletons’ are —\n\nJE\n\nC—C—C—C C= —\n\nFigure 4.8 (a) Two possible carbon-skeletons\n\nFilling the remaining valencies with hydrogen gives us —\n\nH | -H\n\na ae ae | SH\nH-C-C-C-C-H H-C-C.\n\nbert 4 | J NecH\n\nHHH A H H =\n\nFigure 4.8 (b) Complete molecules for two structures with formula C,H,,\n\nWe see that both these structures have the same formula C,H,,. Such\ncompounds with identical molecular formula but different structures\nare called structural isomers.\n\nIn addition to straight and branched carbon chains, some compounds\nhave carbon atoms arranged in the form ofa ring. For example, cyclohexane\nhas the formula C,H,, and the following structure —\n\n% Ny\nFoon H.C gw\nc. _ se H’ ‘Cc Cc H\nG Ax\nH HH H\n() (b)\n\nFigure 4.9 Structure of cyclohexane (a) carbon skeleton (b) complete molecule\n\nCan you draw the electron dot structure for cyclohexane? Straight\nchain, branched chain and cyclic carbon compounds, all may be saturated\n\nor unsaturated. For example, benzene, C,H,, has the following structure —\n\nC ~ Benzene —C,H,\n\nFigure 4.10 Structure of benzene\n\nAll these carbon compounds which contain only carbon and\nhydrogen are called hydrocarbons. Among these, the saturated\nhydrocarbons are called alkanes. The unsaturated hydrocarbons which\ncontain one or more double bonds are called alkenes. Those containing\none or more triple bonds are called alkynes.\n\n4.2.3 Will you be my Friend?\n\nCarbon seems to be a very friendly element. So far we have been looking at\ncompounds containing carbon and hydrogen only. But carbon also forms\n\nCarbon and its Compounds\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n65\n\n\nTable 4.3 Some functional groups in carbon compounds\n\n66\n\nHetero\natom\n\nCl/Br\n\nOxygen\n\nHalo- (Chloro/bromo) —Cl, —Br\nalkane (substitutes for\nhydrogen atom)\n\n4.

In such\ncompounds, the element replacing hydrogen is referred to as a heteroatom.\nThese heteroatoms are also present in some groups as given in Table 4.3.\nThese heteroatoms and\nthe group containing\n\nClass of Formula of these confer specific\n\ncompounds functional group properties to the\ncompound, regardless\n\nof the length and nature\nof the carbon chain and\nhence are called\nfunctional groups. Some\n\n1. Alcohol —OH important functional\ngroups are given in the\n\nyi Table 4.3. Free valency or\n\n2. Aldehyde a valencies of the group\nO are shown by the single\n\nline.

Ketone ll\n\nchain through this\nvalency by replacing one\nhydrogen atom or\n—C-OH atoms.\n\n4.2.4 Homologous Series\n\nYou have seen that carbon atoms can be linked together to form chains\nof varying lengths. These chains can be branched also. In addition,\nhydrogen atom or other atoms on these carbon chains can be replaced\nby any of the functional groups that we saw above. The presence of a\nfunctional group such as alcohol decides the properties of the carbon\ncompound, regardless of the length of the carbon chain. For example,\nthe chemical properties of CH,OH, C,H,OH, C,H,OH and C,H,OH are all\nvery similar. Hence, such a series of compounds in which the same\nfunctional group substitutes for hydrogen in a carbon chain is called a\nhomologous series.\n\nLet us look at the homologous series that we saw earlier in Table\n4.2. If we look at the formulae of successive compounds, say —\n\nCH, and C,H, — these differ by a -CH,- unit\n@.H, and C,H, — these differ by a -CH,- unit\n\nWhat is the difference between the next pair — propane and butane (C,H,,)?\nCan you find out the difference in molecular masses between these\npairs (the atomic mass of carbon is 12 u and the atomic mass of hydrogen\nis 1 u)?\nSimilarly, take the homologous series for alkenes. The first member\nof the series is ethene which we have already come across in\nSection 4.2.1. What is the formula for ethene? The succeeding members\n\nhave the formula C,H,, C,H, and C,H,,. Do these also differ by a -CH,—\n\n3 6?\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nunit? Do you see any relation between the number of carbon and\nhydrogen atoms in these compounds? The general formula for alkenes\ncan be written as C_H,, where n = 2, 3, 4. Can you similarly generate the\ngeneral formula for alkanes and alkynes?\n\nAs the molecular mass increases in any homologous series, a\ngradation in physical properties is seen. This is because the melting and\nboiling points increase with increasing molecular mass. Other physical\nproperties such as solubility in a particular solvent also show a similar\ngradation. But the chemical properties, which are determined solely by\nthe functional group, remain similar in a homologous series.\n\n= Calculate the difference in the formulae and molecular masses\nfor (a) CH,OH and C,H,OH (b) C,H,OH and C,H,OH, and (c) C,H,OH\nand C,H,OH.\nIs there any similarity in these three?\n\n= Arrange these alcohols in the order of increasing carbon atoms to\nget a family. Can we call this family a homologous series?\n\n= Generate the homologous series for compounds containing up to\nfour carbons for the other functional groups given in Table 4.3.\n\n4.2.5 Nomenclature of Carbon Compounds\n\nThe names of compounds in a homologous series are based on the name\n\nof the basic carbon chain modified by a “prefix” “phrase before” or “suffix”\n\n“phrase after” indicating the nature of the functional group. For example,\n\nthe names of the alcohols taken in Activity 4.2 are methanol, ethanol,\n\npropanol and butanol.\n\nNaming a carbon compound can be done by the following method —\n\n(i) Identify the number of carbon atoms in the compound. A compound\nhaving three carbon atoms would have the name propane.\n\n(ii) In case a functional group is present, it is indicated in the\nname of the compound with either a prefix or a suffix (as given\nin Table 4.4).\n\n(iii) Ifthe name of the functional group is to be given as a suffix, and the\nsuffix of the functional group begins with a vowel a, e, i, o, u, then\nthe name of the carbon chain is modified by deleting the final ‘e’ and\nadding the appropriate suffix. For example, a three-carbon chain\nwith a ketone group would be named in the following manner —\nPropane — ‘e’ = propan + ‘one’ = propanone.\n\n(iv) Ifthe carbon chain is unsaturated, then the final ‘ane’ in the name\nof the carbon chain is substituted by ‘ene’ or ‘yne’ as given in\nTable 4.4. For example, a three-carbon chain with a double bond\nwould be called propene and if it has a triple bond, it would be\ncalled propyne.\n\nCarbon and its Compounds\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n67\n\n\nTable 4.4 Nomenclature of organic compounds\n\nClass of\ncompounds\n\nPrefix / Suffix\n\n1.

Since most of the fuels we use are either carbon\nor its compounds, we shall first study combustion.\n\n4.3.1 Combustion\n\nCarbon, in all its allotropic forms, burns in oxygen to give carbon dioxide\nalong with the release of heat and light. Most carbon compounds also\nrelease a large amount of heat and light on burning. These are the\noxidation reactions that you learnt about in the first Chapter —\n\n(i) C+O,— CO, + heat and light\n(ii) CH, +O, — CO, + H,O + heat and light\n(iii) CH,CH,OH + O, — CO, + H,O + heat and light\n\nBalance the latter two reactions like you learnt in the first Chapter.\n\nCAUTION: This Activity needs the teacher’s assistance. = Light a bunsen burner and\n= Take some carbon compounds (naphthalene, adjust the air hole at the\ncamphor, alcohol) one by one on a spatula and burn base to get different types of\nthem. flames/presence of smoke.\n= Observe the nature of the flame and note whether = When do you get a yellow,\nsmoke is produced. sooty flame?\n= When do you get a blue\n\n= Place a metal plate above the flame. Is there a deposition\non the plate in case of any of the compounds?\n\nflame?\nSaturated hydrocarbons will generally give a clean flame while\nunsaturated carbon compounds will give a yellow flame with lots of\nblack smoke. This results in a sooty deposit on the metal plate in Activity\n4.3. However, limiting the supply of air results in incomplete combustion\nof even saturated hydrocarbons giving a sooty flame. The gas/kerosene\nstove used at home has inlets for air so that a sufficiently oxygen-rich\n\nCarbon and its Compounds 69\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nDo You Know?\n\nMore to Know!\n\n70\n\nmixture is burnt to give a clean blue flame. If you observe the bottoms of\ncooking vessels getting blackened, it means that the air holes are blocked\nand fuel is getting wasted. Fuels such as coal and petroleum have some\namount of nitrogen and sulphur in them. Their combustion results in\nthe formation of oxides of sulphur and nitrogen which are major\n\npollutants in the environment.\n\nWhy do substances burn with or without a flame?\n\nHave you ever observed either a coal or a wood fire? If not, the next time you get a\nchance, take close note of what happens when the wood or coal starts to burn. You\nhave seen above that a candle or the LPG in the gas stove burns with a flame. However,\nyou will observe the coal or charcoal in an ‘angithi’ sometimes just glows red and\ngives out heat without a flame. This is because a flame is only produced when gaseous\nsubstances burn. When wood or charcoal is ignited, the volatile substances present\nvapourise and burn with a flame in the beginning.\n\nA luminous flame is seen when the atoms of the gaseous substance are heated and\nstart to glow. The colour produced by each element is a characteristic property of\nthat element. Try and heat a copper wire in the flame of a gas stove and observe its\ncolour. You have seen that incomplete combustion gives soot which is carbon. On\nthis basis, what will you attribute the yellow colour of a candle flame to?\n\nFormation of coal and petroleum\n\nCoal and petroleum have been formed from biomass which has been subjected to\nvarious biological and geological processes. Coal is the remains of trees, ferns, and\nother plants that lived millions of years ago. These were crushed into the earth,\nperhaps by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. They were pressed down by layers of\nearth and rock. They slowly decayed into coal. Oil and gas are the remains of millions\nof tiny plants and animals that lived in the sea. When they died, their bodies sank to\nthe sea bed and were covered by silt. Bacteria attacked the dead remains, turning\nthem into oil and gas under the high pressures they were being subjected to.\nMeanwhile, the silt was slowly compressed into rock. The oil and gas seeped into the\nporous parts of the rock, and got trapped like water in a sponge. Can you guess why\ncoal and petroleum are called fossil fuels?\n\n4.3.2 Oxidation\n\nActivity 4.5\n\nTake about 3 mL of ethanol in a test tube and warm it\ngently in a water bath.\n\nAdd a 5% solution of alkaline potassium permanganate\ndrop by drop to this solution.\n\nDoes the colour of potassium permanganate persist when\nit is added initially?\n\nWhy does the colour of potassium permanganate not\ndisappear when excess is added?\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nYou have learnt\nabout oxidation reactions in\nthe first Chapter. Carbon\ncompounds can be easily\noxidised on combustion. In\naddition to this complete\noxidation, we have reactions\nin which alcohols are\nconverted to carboxylic\nacids —\n\nScience\n\n\nAlkaline KMnO, + Heat\n\nCH, -CH,OH Or acidified K,Cr,O, + Heat\n\nCH,COOH\n\nWe see that some substances are capable of adding oxygen to others.\nThese substances are known as oxidising agents.\n\nAlkaline potassium permanganate or acidified potassium dichromate\nare oxidising alcohols to acids, that is, adding oxygen to the starting\nmaterial. Hence they are known as oxidising agents.\n\n4.3.3 Addition Reaction\n\nUnsaturated hydrocarbons add hydrogen in the presence of catalysts\nsuch as palladium or nickel to give saturated hydrocarbons. Catalysts\nare substances that cause a reaction to occur or proceed at a different\nrate without the reaction itself being affected. This reaction is commonly\nused in the hydrogenation of vegetable oils using a nickel catalyst.\nVegetable oils generally have long unsaturated carbon chains while\nanimal fats have saturated carbon chains.\n\nR R Nickel catal ae\nNi talyst\nYeg4 gat ickel catalyst, 2 4 Gp\nR’ \\R Hi | |\nRR\n\nYou must have seen advertisements stating that some vegetable oils\nare ‘healthy’. Animal fats generally contain saturated fatty acids which\nare said to be harmful for health. Oils containing unsaturated fatty acids\nshould be chosen for cooking.\n\n4.3.4 Substitution Reaction\n\nSaturated hydrocarbons are fairly unreactive and are inert in the presence\nof most reagents. However, in the presence of sunlight, chlorine is added\nto hydrocarbons in a very fast reaction. Chlorine can replace the hydrogen\natoms one by one. It is called a substitution reaction because one type\nof atom or a group of atoms takes the place of another. A number of\nproducts are usually formed with the higher homologues of alkanes.\n\nCH, + Cl, — CH,Cl + HCl (in the presence of sunlight)\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nWhy is the conversion of ethanol to ethanoic acid an oxidation reaction?\n\nA mixture of oxygen and ethyne is burnt for welding.

But here we shall study\nthe properties of two commercially important compounds — ethanol and\nethanoic acid.\n\nCarbon and its Compounds 71\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n4.4.1 Properties of Ethanol\n\nEthanol is a liquid at room temperature (refer to Table 4.1 for the melting\nand boiling points of ethanol). Ethanol is commonly called alcohol and\nis the active ingredient of all alcoholic drinks. In addition, because it is a\ngood solvent, it is also used in medicines such as tincture iodine, cough\nsyrups, and many tonics. Ethanol is also soluble in water in all\nproportions. Consumption of small quantities of dilute ethanol causes\ndrunkenness. Even though this practice is condemned, it is a socially\nwidespread practice. However, intake of even a small quantity of pure\nethanol (called absolute alcohol) can be lethal. Also, long-term\nconsumption of alcohol leads to many health problems.\n\nReactions of Ethanol\n\n(i) Reaction with sodium —\n\n2Na + 2CH,CH,OH — 2CH,CH,O-Na* + H,\n\nTeacher’s demonstration —\n\n= Drop a small piece of sodium,\nabout the size of a couple of\ngrains of rice, into ethanol\n(absolute alcohol).\n\n= What do you observe?\n\n= How will you test the gas evolved?\n\n(Sodium ethoxide)\n\nAlcohols react with sodium leading to the\nevolution of hydrogen. With ethanol, the other\nproduct is sodium ethoxide. Can you recall which\nother substances produce hydrogen on reacting with\nmetals?\n\n(ii) Reaction to give unsaturated hydrocarbon: Heating ethanol at\n443 K with excess concentrated sulphuric acid results in the\ndehydration of ethanol to give ethene -\n\nCHS 30H S50.

The melting point of pure ethanoic acid\nis 290 K and hence it often freezes during winter\nin cold climates. This gave rise to its name glacial\nacetic acid.\n\nThe group of organic compounds called\ncarboxylic acids are obviously characterised by\n\nCompare the pH of dilute acetic acid\nand dilute hydrochloric acid using\nboth litmus paper and universal\nindicator.\n\nAre both acids indicated by the\nlitmus test?\n\nDoes the universal indicator show\nthem as equally strong acids?\n\ntheir acidic nature.

These are used in\nmaking perfumes and as flavouring agents. On treating with sodium\nhydroxide, which is an alkali, the ester is converted back to alcohol\nand sodium salt of carboxylic acid. This reaction is known as\nsaponification because it is used in the preparation of soap.

Most dirt is\noily in nature and as you know, oil does not dissolve in water. The\nmolecules of soap are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic\nacids. The ionic-end of soap interacts with water while the carbon chain\ninteracts with oil. The soap molecules, thus form structures called\nmicelles (see Fig. 4.12) where one end of the molecules is towards the oil\ndroplet while the ionic-end faces outside. This forms an emulsion in\nwater. The soap micelle thus helps in pulling out the dirt in water and\nwe can wash our clothes clean (Fig. 4.13).\n\nCan you draw the structure of the micelle that would be formed if\nyou dissolve soap in a hydrocarbon?\n\nMicelles\nSoaps are molecules in which the two ends have differing properties, one is hydrophilic,\nthat is, it interacts with water, while the other end is hydrophobic, that is, it interacts\nwith hydrocarbons. When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic ‘tail’ of soap\nwill not be soluble in water and the soap will align along the surface of water with the\nionic end in water and the hydrocarbon ‘tail’ protruding out of water. Inside water,\n\nHydrophilic end Hydrophobic end\n——» pee\nO YIYYYVS._ Soap molecule\n\nHydrophilic end\n6 ) | iil Hydrophobic end\n\n> Ay ee Moca WE\nae ae\n\nthese molecules have a unique orientation that keeps\nthe hydrocarbon portion out of the water. Thus,\nclusters of molecules in which the hydrophobic tails\nare in the interior of the cluster and the ionic ends\nare on the surface of the cluster. This formation is\ncalled a micelle. Soap in the form of a micelle is able\nto clean, since the oily dirt will be collected in the\ncentre of the micelle. The micelles stay in solution as\na colloid and will not come together to precipitate\nbecause of ion-ion repulsion. Thus, the dirt\nsuspended in the micelles is also easily rinsed away.\nThe soap micelles are large enough to scatter light.\nHence a soap solution appears cloudy.\n\nMore to Know!\n\nFigure 4.13 Effect of soap in cleaning\n\nCarbon and its Compounds 75\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nActivity 4.11\n\n= Take about 10 mL of distilled water (or rain water) and 10 mL of\nhard water (from a tubewell or hand-pump) in separate test tubes.\n= Add a couple of drops of soap solution to both.\nShake the test tubes vigorously for an equal period of time and\nobserve the amount of foam formed.\nIn which test tube do you get more foam?\nIn which test tube do you observe a white curdy precipitate?\nNote for the teacher: If hard water is not available in your locality,\nprepare some hard water by dissolving hydrogencarbonates/\nsulphates/chlorides of calcium or magnesium in water.\n\n= Take two test tubes with about 10 mL of hard water in each.\n\n= Add five drops of soap solution to one and five drops of detergent\nsolution to the other.\n\n= Shake both test tubes for the same period.\n\n= Do both test tubes have the same amount of foam?\n\n= In which test tube is a curdy solid formed?\n\nHave you ever observed while bathing that foam is formed with\ndifficulty and an insoluble substance (scum) remains after washing with\nwater? This is caused by the reaction of soap with the calcium and\nmagnesium salts, which cause the hardness of water. Hence you need\nto use a larger amount of soap. This problem is overcome by using\nanother class of compounds called detergents as cleansing agents.\nDetergents are generally sodium salts of sulphonic acids or ammonium\nsalts with chlorides or bromides ions, etc. Both have long hydrocarbon\nchain. The charged ends of these compounds do not form insoluble\nprecipitates with the calcium and magnesium ions in hard water. Thus,\nthey remain effective in hard water. Detergents are usually used to make\nshampoos and products for cleaning clothes.\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nWould you be able to check if water is hard by using a detergent?\n\nPeople use a variety of methods to wash clothes.

Let us now study the properties of some carbon compounds.\nMost carbon compounds are poor conductors of electricity as we\nhave seen in Chapter 2.

Since these compounds are\nlargely non-conductors of electricity, we | Ethanol (CH,CH,OH) 156 351\ncan conclude that the bonding in these\ncompounds does not give rise to any ions.\n\nIn Class IX, we learnt about the\ncombining capacity of various elements and how it depends on the\nnumber of valence electrons. Let us now look at the electronic\nconfiguration of carbon. The atomic number of carbon is 6. What would\nbe the distribution of electrons in various shells of carbon? How many\nvalence electrons will carbon have?\n\nWe know that the reactivity of elements is explained as their tendency\nto attain a completely filled outer shell, that is, attain noble gas\nconfiguration. Elements forming ionic compounds achieve this by either\ngaining or losing electrons from the outermost shell. In the case of carbon,\nit has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs to gain or lose four\nelectrons to attain noble gas configuration. If it were to gain or lose\nelectrons —\n\nChloroform (CHCI,) 209 334\n\nMethane (CH,) 90 111\n\n(i) It could gain four electrons forming C* anion. But it would be difficult\nfor the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons, that is,\nfour extra electrons.\n\n(ii) It could lose four electrons forming C** cation. But it would require\na large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a\ncarbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two\nelectrons.\n\nCarbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with\nother atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements. Not just carbon,\nbut many other elements form molecules by sharing electrons in this\nmanner. The shared electrons ‘belong’ to the outermost shells of both\nthe atoms and lead to both atoms attaining the noble gas configuration.\nBefore going on to compounds of carbon, let us look at some simple\nmolecules formed by the sharing of valence electrons.\n\nThe simplest molecule formed in this manner is that of hydrogen.\nAs you have learnt earlier, the atomic number of hydrogen is 1. Hence\nhydrogen has one electron in its K shell and it requires one more electron\nto fill the K shell. So two hydrogen atoms share their electrons to form a\nmolecule of hydrogen, H,.

This is because an atom of oxygen has six electrons\nin its L shell (the atomic number of oxygen is eight) and it requires two\nmore electrons to complete its octet. So each atom of oxygen shares two\nelectrons with another atom of oxygen to give us the structure shown in\nFig. 4.3.

This outnumbers by a large\nmargin the compounds formed by all the other elements put together.\nWhy is it that this property is seen in carbon and no other element?\nThe nature of the covalent bond enables carbon to form a large number\nof compounds. Two factors noticed in the case of carbon are -\n\n(i) Carbon has the unique ability to form bonds with other atoms of\ncarbon, giving rise to large molecules. This property is called\ncatenation. These compounds may have long chains of carbon,\nbranched chains of carbon or even carbon atoms arranged in rings.\nIn addition, carbon atoms may be linked by single, double or triple\nbonds. Compounds of carbon, which are linked by only single\nbonds between the carbon atoms are called saturated compounds.\nCompounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between their\ncarbon atoms are called unsaturated compounds.\n\nNo other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent\nseen in carbon compounds. Silicon forms compounds with\nhydrogen which have chains of upto seven or eight atoms, but these\ncompounds are very reactive. The carbon-carbon bond is very strong\nand hence stable. This gives us the large number of compounds\nwith many carbon atoms linked to each other.\n\n(ii) Since carbon has a valency of four, it is capable of bonding with\nfour other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other mono-valent\nelement. Compounds of carbon are formed with oxygen, hydrogen,\nnitrogen, sulphur, chlorine and many other elements giving rise to\ncompounds with specific properties which depend on the elements\nother than carbon present in the molecule.\n\nAgain the bonds that carbon forms with most other elements are\nvery strong making these compounds exceptionally stable. One\nreason for the formation of strong bonds by carbon is its small size.\nThis enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons\nstrongly. The bonds formed by elements having bigger atoms are\nmuch weaker.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

If not, the next time you get a\nchance, take close note of what happens when the wood or coal starts to burn. You\nhave seen above that a candle or the LPG in the gas stove burns with a flame. However,\nyou will observe the coal or charcoal in an ‘angithi’ sometimes just glows red and\ngives out heat without a flame. This is because a flame is only produced when gaseous\nsubstances burn. When wood or charcoal is ignited, the volatile substances present\nvapourise and burn with a flame in the beginning.\n\nA luminous flame is seen when the atoms of the gaseous substance are heated and\nstart to glow. The colour produced by each element is a characteristic property of\nthat element. Try and heat a copper wire in the flame of a gas stove and observe its\ncolour. You have seen that incomplete combustion gives soot which is carbon. On\nthis basis, what will you attribute the yellow colour of a candle flame to?\n\nFormation of coal and petroleum\n\nCoal and petroleum have been formed from biomass which has been subjected to\nvarious biological and geological processes. Coal is the remains of trees, ferns, and\nother plants that lived millions of years ago. These were crushed into the earth,\nperhaps by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. They were pressed down by layers of\nearth and rock. They slowly decayed into coal. Oil and gas are the remains of millions\nof tiny plants and animals that lived in the sea. When they died, their bodies sank to\nthe sea bed and were covered by silt. Bacteria attacked the dead remains, turning\nthem into oil and gas under the high pressures they were being subjected to.\nMeanwhile, the silt was slowly compressed into rock. The oil and gas seeped into the\nporous parts of the rock, and got trapped like water in a sponge.

        "text": "This activity demonstrates the effect of soap in cleaning. Most dirt is\noily in nature and as you know, oil does not dissolve in water. The\nmolecules of soap are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic\nacids. The ionic-end of soap interacts with water while the carbon chain\ninteracts with oil. The soap molecules, thus form structures called\nmicelles (see Fig. 4.12) where one end of the molecules is towards the oil\ndroplet while the ionic-end faces outside. This forms an emulsion in\nwater. The soap micelle thus helps in pulling out the dirt in water and\nwe can wash our clothes clean (Fig. 4.13).\n\nCan you draw the structure of the micelle that would be formed if\nyou dissolve soap in a hydrocarbon?\n\nMicelles\nSoaps are molecules in which the two ends have differing properties, one is hydrophilic,\nthat is, it interacts with water, while the other end is hydrophobic, that is, it interacts\nwith hydrocarbons. When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic ‘tail’ of soap\nwill not be soluble in water and the soap will align along the surface of water with the\nionic end in water and the hydrocarbon ‘tail’ protruding out of water.

Soap in the form of a micelle is able\nto clean, since the oily dirt will be collected in the\ncentre of the micelle. The micelles stay in solution as\na colloid and will not come together to precipitate\nbecause of ion-ion repulsion. Thus, the dirt\nsuspended in the micelles is also easily rinsed away.\nThe soap micelles are large enough to scatter light.\nHence a soap solution appears cloudy.\n\nMore to Know!\n\nFigure 4.13 Effect of soap in cleaning\n\nCarbon and its Compounds 75\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

    "full_text": "CHAPTER 5\nLife Processes\n\nH” do we tell the difference between what is alive and what is not\nalive? If we see a dog running, or a cow chewing cud, or a man\nshouting loudly on the street, we know that these are living beings. What\nif the dog or the cow or the man were asleep? We would still think that\nthey were alive, but how did we know that? We see them breathing, and\nwe know that they are alive. What about plants? How do we know that\nthey are alive? We see them green, some of us will say. But what about\nplants that have leaves of colours other than green? They grow over\ntime, so we know that they are alive, some will say. In other words, we\ntend to think of some sort of movement, either growth-related or not, as\ncommon evidence for being alive. But a plant that is not visibly growing is\nstill alive, and some animals can breathe without visible movement. So\nusing visible movement as the defining characteristic of life is not enough.\n\nMovements over very small scales will be invisible to the naked eye —\nmovements of molecules, for example. Is this invisible molecular\nmovement necessary for life? If we ask this question to professional\nbiologists, they will say yes. In fact, viruses do not show any molecular\nmovement in them (until they infect some cell), and that is partly why\nthere is a controversy about whether they are truly alive or not.\n\nWhy are molecular movements needed for life? We have seen in earlier\nclasses that living organisms are well-organised structures; they can\nhave tissues, tissues have cells, cells have smaller components in them,\nand so on. Because of the effects of the environment, this organised,\nordered nature of living structures is very likely to keep breaking down\nover time. If order breaks down, the organism will no longer be alive. So\nliving creatures must keep repairing and maintaining their structures.\nSince all these structures are made up of molecules, they must move\nmolecules around all the time.\n\nWhat are the maintenance processes in living organisms?\nLet us explore.\n\n5.1 WHAT ARE LIFE PROCESSES?\n\nThe maintenance functions of living organisms must go on even when\nthey are not doing anything particular. Even when we are just sitting in\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n1064CHO6\n\n\n80\n\nclass, even if we are just asleep, this maintenance job has to go on.\nThe processes which together perform this maintenance job are\nlife processes.\n\nSince these maintenance processes are needed to prevent damage\nand break-down, energy is needed for them. This energy comes from\noutside the body of the individual organism. So there must be a process\nto transfer a source of energy from outside the body of the organism,\nwhich we call food, to the inside, a process we commonly call nutrition.\nIf the body size of the organisms is to grow, additional raw material will\nalso be needed from outside. Since life on earth depends on carbon-\nbased molecules, most of these food sources are also carbon-based.\nDepending on the complexity of these carbon sources, different\norganisms can then use different kinds of nutritional processes.\n\nThe outside sources of energy could be quite varied, since the\nenvironment is not under the control of the individual organism. These\nsources of energy, therefore, need to be broken down or built up in the\nbody, and must be finally converted to a uniform source of energy that\ncan be used for the various molecular movements needed for\nmaintaining living structures, as well as to the kind of molecules the\nbody needs to grow. For this, a series of chemical reactions in the\nbody are necessary. Oxidising-reducing reactions are some of the most\ncommon chemical means to break-down molecules. For this, many\norganisms use oxygen sourced from outside the body. The process\nof acquiring oxygen from outside the body, and to use it in the process\nof break-down of food sources for cellular needs, is what we call\nrespiration.\n\nIn the case of a single-celled organism, no specific organs for taking\nin food, exchange of gases or removal of wastes may be needed because\nthe entire surface of the organism is in contact with the environment.\nBut what happens when the body size of the organism increases and\nthe body design becomes more complex? In multi-cellular organisms,\nall the cells may not be in direct contact with the surrounding\nenvironment. Thus, simple diffusion will not meet the requirements of\nall the cells.\n\nWe have seen previously how, in multi-cellular organisms, various\nbody parts have specialised in the functions they perform. We are familiar\nwith the idea of these specialised tissues, and with their organisation in\nthe body of the organism. It is therefore not surprising that the uptake\nof food and of oxygen will also be the function of specialised tissues.\nHowever, this poses a problem, since the food and oxygen are now taken\nup at one place in the body of the organisms, while all parts of the body\nneed them. This situation creates a need for a transportation system for\ncarrying food and oxygen from one place to another in the body.\n\nWhen chemical reactions use the carbon source and the oxygen for\nenergy generation, they create by-products that are not only useless\nfor the cells of the body, but could even be harmful. These waste by-\nproducts are therefore needed to be removed from the body and discarded\noutside by a process called excretion. Again, if the basic rules for body\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\ndesign in multi-cellular organisms are followed, a specialised tissue for\nexcretion will be developed, which means that the transportation system\nwill need to transport waste away from cells to this excretory tissue.\n\nLet us consider these various processes, so essential to maintain\nlife, one by one.\n\nQ U ES TION S$\n\nWhy is diffusion insufficient to meet the oxygen requirements of multi-\ncellular organisms like humans?\n\nWhat criteria do we use to decide whether something is alive?\nWhat are outside raw materials used for by an organism?\n\nWhat processes would you consider essential for maintaining life?\n\n5.2 NUTRITION\n\nWhen we walk or ride a bicycle, we are using up energy. Even when we\nare not doing any apparent activity, energy is needed to maintain a\nstate of order in our body. We also need materials from outside in order\nto grow, develop, synthesise protein and other substances needed in\nthe body. This source of energy and materials is the food we eat.\n\nHow do living things get their food?\n\nThe general requirement for energy and materials is common in all\norganisms, but it is fulfilled in different ways. Some organisms use simple\nfood material obtained from inorganic sources in the form of carbon\ndioxide and water. These organisms, the autotrophs, include green\nplants and some bacteria. Other organisms utilise complex substances.\nThese complex substances have to be broken down into simpler ones\nbefore they can be used for the upkeep and growth of the body. To\nachieve this, organisms use bio-catalysts called enzymes. Thus, the\nheterotrophs survival depends directly or indirectly on autotrophs.\nHeterotrophic organisms include animals and fungi.\n\n5.2.1 Autotrophic Nutrition\n\nCarbon and energy requirements of the autotrophic organism are\nfulfilled by photosynthesis. It is the process by which autotrophs take\nin substances from the outside and convert them into stored forms of\nenergy. This material is taken in the form of carbon dioxide and water\nwhich is converted into carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight and\nchlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant.\nWe will study how this takes place in the next section. The carbohydrates\nwhich are not used immediately are stored in the form of starch, which\nserves as the internal energy reserve to be used as and when required\nby the plant. A somewhat similar situation is seen in us where some of\nthe energy derived from the food we eat is stored in our body in the form\nof glycogen.\n\nLife Processes 81\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n6CO, +12H,O\n\nChlorophyll\n\nSunlight C,H,.0, +60, +6H,O\n\n(Glucose)\n\nLet us now see what actually happens during the process of\nphotosynthesis. The following events occur during this process —\n\nPhloem Xylem\nVascular bundle Waxy\ncuticle\n\nUpper\nepidermis\n\nFigure 5.1\nCross-section of a leaf\n\n(i) Absorption of light energy by\n\nchlorophyll.\n\n(ii) Conversion of light energy to chemical\nenergy and splitting of water molecules\ninto hydrogen and oxygen.\n\n(iii) Reduction of carbon dioxide to\ncarbohydrates.\n\nThese steps need not take place one after\nthe other immediately. For example, desert\nplants take up carbon dioxide at night and\nprepare an intermediate which is acted upon\nby the energy absorbed by the chlorophyll\nduring the day.\n\nLet us see how each of the components of\nthe above reaction are necessary for\nphotosynthesis.\n\nIf you carefully observe a cross-section of a\nleaf under the microscope (shown in Fig. 5.1),\nyou will notice that some cells contain green\ndots. These green dots are cell organelles called\nchloroplasts which contain chlorophyll. Let us\ndo an activity which demonstrates that\nchlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis.\n\n= Take a potted plant with variegated leaves — for example, money plant\n\nor crotons.\n\ngets used up.\n\nsolution?\n\n= Keep the plant in a dark room for three days so that all the starch\n\nNow keep the plant in sunlight for about six hours.\n\n= Pluck a leaf from the plant.

In Class IX,\n\nwe had talked about stomata (Fig. 5.3)\n\nwhich are tiny pores present on the\n\nsurface of the leaves. Massive amounts\n\nof gaseous exchange takes place in the Stomatal pore\n\nleaves through these pores for the\n\npurpose of photosynthesis. But it is Chloroplast\n\nimportant to note here that exchange\n\nof gases occurs across the surface of\n\nstems, roots and leaves as well. Since\n\nlarge amounts of water can also be lost (a) (b)\nthrough these stomata, the plant Figure 5.3 (a) Open and (b) closed stomatal pore\ncloses these pores when it does not\nneed carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. The opening and closing of the\npore is a function of the guard cells. The guard cells swell when water\nflows into them, causing the stomatal pore to open. Similarly the pore\ncloses if the guard cells shrink.\n\nActivity 5.2\n\n= Take two healthy potted plants\nwhich are nearly the same size.\n\n= Keep them in a dark room for\nthree days.\n\n= Now place each plant on\nseparate glass plates.

But they also need other raw materials for building their\nbody. Water used in photosynthesis is taken up from the soil by the\nroots in terrestrial plants. Other materials like nitrogen, phosphorus,\niron and magnesium are taken up from the soil. Nitrogen is an essential\nelement used in the synthesis of proteins and other compounds. This is\n\nLife Processes 83\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nNucleus\n\ntaken up in the form of inorganic nitrates or nitrites. Or it is taken up as\norganic compounds which have been prepared by bacteria from\natmospheric nitrogen.\n\n5.2.2 Heterotrophic Nutrition\n\nEach organism is adapted to its environment. The form of nutrition\ndiffers depending on the type and availability of food material as well\nas how it is obtained by the organism. For example, whether the food\nsource is stationary (such as grass) or mobile (such as a deer), would\nallow for differences in how the food is accessed and what is the nutritive\napparatus used by a cow and a lion. There is a range of strategies by\nwhich the food is taken in and used by the organism. Some organisms\nbreak-down the food material outside the body and then absorb it.\nExamples are fungi like bread moulds, yeast and mushrooms. Others\ntake in whole material and break it down inside their bodies. What can\nbe taken in and broken down depends on the body design and\nfunctioning. Some other organisms derive nutrition from plants or\nanimals without killing them. This parasitic nutritive strategy is used\nby a wide variety of organisms like cuscuta (amar-bel), ticks, lice,\nleeches and tape-worms.\n\n5.2.3 How do Organisms obtain their Nutrition?\n\nSince the food and the way it is obtained differ, the digestive system is\ndifferent in various organisms. In single-celled organisms, the food\nmay be taken in by the entire surface. But as the complexity of the\n\ndifferent functions. For example, Amoeba takes in food using\ntemporary finger-like extensions of the cell surface which fuse over\n\na d% Va Food particle _ organism increases, different parts become specialised to perform\na\n\nthe food particle forming a food-vacuole (Fig. 5.5). Inside the food-\n\n. e Pseudopodia : ;\n() ! vacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones\n\n4 Food vacuole\n\n()\n\nFigure 5.5\nNutrition in Amoeba\n\n84\n\nwhich then diffuse into the cytoplasm. The remaining undigested\nmaterial is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out. In\nParamoecium, which is also a unicellular organism, the cell has a\ndefinite shape and food is taken in at a specific spot. Food is moved\nto this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface\nof the cell.\n\nFood particle\n\n5.2.4 Nutrition in Human Beings\n\nThe alimentary canal is basically a long tube extending from the mouth\nto the anus. In Fig. 5.6, we can see that the tube has different parts.\nVarious regions are specialised to perform different functions. What\nhappens to the food once it enters our body? We shall discuss this\nprocess here.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n= Take 1 mL starch solution (1%) in two test tubes (A and B).\n\n= Add 1 mL saliva to test tube A and leave both test tubes undisturbed\nfor 20-30 minutes.\n\n= Now add a few drops of dilute iodine solution to the test tubes.\n\n= In which test tube do you observe a colour change?\n\n= What does this indicate about the presence or absence of starch\nin the two test tubes?\n\n= What does this tell us about the action of saliva on starch?\n\nWe eat various types of food which has to pass through the same\ndigestive tract. Naturally the food has to be processed to generate\nparticles which are small and of the same texture. This is achieved by\ncrushing the food with our teeth. Since the lining of the canal is soft, the\nfood is also wetted to make its passage smooth. When we eat something\nwe like, our mouth ‘waters’. This is actually not only water, but a fluid\ncalled saliva secreted by the salivary glands. Another aspect of the food\nwe ingest is its complex nature. If it is to be absorbed from the alimentary\ncanal, it has to be broken into smaller molecules. This is done with the\nhelp of biological catalysts called\nenzymes. The saliva contains an\nenzyme called salivary amylase that\nbreaks down starch which is a complex\nmolecule to give simple sugar. The food proneye\nis mixed thoroughly with saliva and\nmoved around the mouth while\nchewing by the muscular tongue.\n\nIt is necessary to move the food in\naregulated manner along the digestive\ntube so that it can be processed\nproperly in each part. The lining of Gall bladder\ncanal has muscles that contract res Pile)\nrhythmically in order to push the food Bile duct\nforward. These peristaltic movements\noccur all along the gut.\n\nFrom the mouth, the food is taken\nto the stomach through the food-pipe\nor oesophagus. The stomach is a large\norgan which expands when food Appendix\nenters it. The muscular walls of the\nstomach help in mixing the food\nthoroughly with more digestive juices.\n\nThe digestion in stomach is taken\ncare of by the gastric glands present in the wall of the stomach. These\nrelease hydrochloric acid, a protein digesting enzyme called pepsin,\nand mucus. The hydrochloric acid creates an acidic medium which\nfacilitates the action of the enzyme pepsin. What other function do you\nthink is served by the acid? The mucus protects the inner lining of the\nstomach from the action of the acid under normal conditions. We\n\nDiaphragm\n\nLife Processes\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nOesophagus\n\nMouth (Buccal cavity)\n\nSmall\n\nFigure 5.6 Human alimentary canal\n\n85\n\n\nMore to Know!\n\nhave often heard adults complaining about ‘acidity’. Can this be related\nto what has been discussed above?\n\nThe exit of food from the stomach is regulated by a sphincter muscle\nwhich releases it in small amounts into the small intestine. From the\nstomach, the food now enters the small intestine. This is the longest part\nof the alimentary canal which is fitted into a compact space because of\nextensive coiling. The length of the small intestine differs in various\nanimals depending on the food they eat. Herbivores eating grass need a\nlonger small intestine to allow the cellulose to be digested. Meat is easier\nto digest, hence carnivores like tigers have a shorter small intestine.\n\nThe small intestine is the site of the complete digestion of\ncarbohydrates, proteins and fats. It receives the secretions of the liver\nand pancreas for this purpose. The food coming from the stomach is\nacidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act.\nBile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats.\nFats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes\nit difficult for enzymes to act on them. Bile salts break them down into\nsmaller globules increasing the efficiency of enzyme action. This is similar\nto the emulsifying action of soaps on dirt that we have learnt about in\nChapter 4. The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which contains\nenzymes like trypsin for digesting proteins and lipase for breaking down\nemulsified fats. The walls of the small intestine contain glands which\nsecrete intestinal juice. The enzymes present in it finally convert the\nproteins to amino acids, complex carbohydrates into glucose and fats\ninto fatty acids and glycerol.\n\nDigested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner\nlining of the small intestine has numerous finger-like projections called\nvilli which increase the surface area for absorption. The villi are richly\nsupplied with blood vessels which take the absorbed food to each and\nevery cell of the body, where it is utilised for obtaining energy, building\nup new tissues and the repair of old tissues.\n\nThe unabsorbed food is sent into the large intestine where its wall\nabsorb more water from this material. The rest of the material is removed\nfrom the body via the anus. The exit of this waste material is regulated\nby the anal sphincter.\n\nDental caries\n\nDental caries or tooth decay causes gradual softening of enamel and dentine. It begins\nwhen bacteria acting on sugars produce acids that softens or demineralises the enamel.\n\nMasses of bacterial cells together with food particles stick to the teeth to form dental\nplaque. Saliva cannot reach the tooth surface to neutralise the acid as plaque covers\nthe teeth. Brushing the teeth after eating removes the plaque before the bacteria\nproduce acids. If untreated, microorganisms may invade the pulp, causing\ninflammation and infection.\n\n6 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nQ U ES TION S$\n\nWhat are the differences between autotrophic nutrition and heterotrophic\nnutrition?\n\nWhere do plants get each of the raw materials required for photosynthesis?\nWhat is the role of the acid in our stomach?\n\nWhat is the function of digestive enzymes?\n\nHow is the small intestine designed to absorb digested food?\n\n5.3 RESPIRATION\n\n= Take some freshly prepared lime\nwater in a test tube.

The\nfood material taken in during the process of nutrition is used in cells to\nprovide energy for various life processes. Diverse organisms do this in\ndifferent ways — some use oxygen to break-down glucose completely\ninto carbon dioxide and water, some use other pathways that do not\ninvolve oxygen (Fig. 5.8). In all cases, the first step is the break-down of\nglucose, a six-carbon molecule, into a three-carbon molecule called\npyruvate. This process takes place in the cytoplasm. Further, the\npyruvate may be converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process\ntakes place in yeast during fermentation. Since this process takes place\nin the absence of air (oxygen), it is called anaerobic respiration. Break-\ndown of pyruvate using oxygen takes place in the mitochondria. This\n\nLife Processes 87\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nMore to Know!\n\nprocess breaks up the three-carbon pyruvate molecule to give three\nmolecules of carbon dioxide. The other product is water. Since this\nprocess takes place in the presence of air (oxygen), it is called aerobic\nrespiration. The release of energy in this aerobic process is a lot greater\nthan in the anaerobic process. Sometimes, when there is a lack of oxygen\nin our muscle cells, another pathway for the break-down of pyruvate is\ntaken. Here the pyruvate is converted into lactic acid which is also a\nthree-carbon molecule. This build-up of lactic acid in our muscles during\nsudden activity causes cramps.\n\nAbsence of\noxygen\n\nEthanol + Carbon dioxide + Energy\n(2-carbon molecule)\n\nIn\ncytoplasm Lack of oxygen\nGlucose ————> Pyruvate ti Lactic acid + Energy\nicone eae muscle ‘cells) (3-carbon molecule)\n* Presence of\nEnergy\n\noxygen\n(in\nmitochondria)\n\nCarbon dioxide + Water + Energy\n\nFigure 5.8 Break-down of glucose by various pathways\n\nThe energy released during cellular respiration is immediately used\nto synthesise a molecule called ATP which is used to fuel all other\nactivities in the cell. In these processes, ATP is broken down giving rise\nto a fixed amount of energy which can drive the endothermic reactions\ntaking place in the cell.\n\nSince the aerobic respiration pathway depends on oxygen, aerobic\norganisms need to ensure that there is sufficient intake of oxygen. We\nhave seen that plants exchange gases through stomata, and the large\ninter-cellular spaces ensure that all cells are in contact with air. Carbon\ndioxide and oxygen are exchanged by diffusion here. They can go into\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\ncells, or away from them and out into the air. The direction of diffusion\ndepends upon the environmental conditions and the requirements of\nthe plant. At night, when there is no photosynthesis occurring, CO,\nelimination is the major exchange activity going on. During the day,\nCO, generated during respiration is used up for photosynthesis, hence\nthere is no CO, release. Instead, oxygen release is the major event at\nthis time.\n\nAnimals have evolved different organs for the uptake of oxygen\nfrom the environment and for getting rid of the carbon dioxide\nproduced. Terrestrial animals can breathe the oxygen in the\natmosphere, but animals that live in water need to use the oxygen\ndissolved in water.\n\n= Observe fish in an aquarium. They open and close their mouths\nand the gill-slits (or the operculum which covers the gill-slits)\nbehind their eyes also open and close.

This oxygen is absorbed by different organs in\n\nMore to Know!\n\nUsing tobacco directly or\nany product of tobacco in\nthe form of cigar, cigarettes,\n\ndifferent animals. All these organs have a structure that increases\nthe surface area which is in contact with the oxygen-rich\natmosphere. Since the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide\nhas to take place across this surface, this surface is very fine\nand delicate. In order to protect this surface, it is usually placed\nwithin the body, so there have to be passages that will take air\nto this area. In addition, there is a mechanism for moving the air\nin and out of this area where the oxygen is absorbed.\n\nIn human beings (Fig. 5.9), air is taken into the body through\nthe nostrils. The air passing through the nostrils is filtered by\nfine hairs that line the passage. The passage is also lined with\nmucus which helps in this process. From here, the air passes\nthrough the throat and into the lungs. Rings of cartilage are\npresent in the throat. These ensure that the air-passage does\nnot collapse.\n\nLife Processes\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nbidis, hookah, gutkha, etc.,\nis harmful.

In Class IX, we learnt about blood\nbeing a fluid connective tissue. Blood consists of a fluid medium called\nplasma in which the cells are suspended. Plasma transports food, carbon\ndioxide and nitrogenous wastes in dissolved form. Oxygen is carried by\nthe red blood corpuscles. Many other substances like salts, are also\ntransported by the blood. We thus need a pumping organ to push blood\naround the body, a network of tubes to reach all the tissues and a system\nin place to ensure that this network can be repaired if damaged.\n\nLife Processes 91\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nVena Cava\n\nfrom upper | |\nbody 7 é\nRight atrium y\nVena Cava\n\nfrom lower\nbody\nRight\nventricle\n\nSeptum\n(dividing wall)\n\nFigure 5.10\nSchematic sectional\nview of the human heart\n\nPulmonary\nartery to lungs\n\nVena cava\n\nFrom body\n\nVein\n\nFigure 5.11\n\nCapillaries in |\nbody organs apart {\nfrom the lungs ;\n\nOur pump — the heart\n\nAorta The heart is a muscular organ which is\n\nas big as our fist (Fig. 5.10). Because\nboth oxygen and carbon dioxide have to\nbe transported by the blood, the heart\nPulmonary veins has different chambers to prevent the\noxygen-rich blood from mixing with the\n-—_})- Left atrium blood containing carbon dioxide. The\ncarbon dioxide-rich blood has to reach\nthe lungs for the carbon dioxide to be\nremoved, and the oxygenated blood from\nthe lungs has to be brought back to the\nheart. This oxygen-rich blood is then\npumped to the rest of the body.\n\nWe can follow this process step by\nstep (Fig. 5.11). Oxygen-rich blood from\nthe lungs comes to the thin-walled upper\nchamber of the heart on the left, the left atrium. The left atrium relaxes\nwhen it is collecting this blood. It then contracts, while the next chamber,\nthe left ventricle, relaxes, so that the blood is transferred to it. When the\nmuscular left ventricle contracts in its turn, the blood is pumped out to\nthe body. De-oxygenated blood comes from the body to the upper\nchamber on the right, the right atrium, as it relaxes. As the right atrium\ncontracts, the corresponding lower chamber, the right ventricle, dilates.\nThis transfers blood to the right ventricle, which in turn pumps it to the\nlungs for oxygenation. Since ventricles have to pump blood into various\norgans, they have thicker muscular walls than the atria do. Valves ensure\nthat blood does not flow backwards when the atria or ventricles contract.\n\nPulmonary arteries\n\nLeft ventricle\n\nOxygen enters the blood in the lungs\n\nThe separation of the right side and the left side of\nPimonagrien the heart is useful to keep oxygenated and de-\nfrom lungs oxygenated blood from mixing. Such separation\nallows a highly efficient supply of oxygen to the\nbody. This is useful in animals that have high\nenergy needs, such as birds and mammals, which\nconstantly use energy to maintain their body\nTo body temperature. In animals that do not use energy\nfor this purpose, the body temperature depends\non the temperature in the environment. Such\nanimals, like amphibians or many reptiles have\nthree-chambered hearts, and tolerate some mixing\nof the oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood\nstreams. Fishes, on the other hand, have only two\nchambers to their hearts, and the blood is pumped\nto the gills, is oxygenated there, and passes directly\n\nAorta\n\nSchematic representation of transport and exchange to the rest of the body. Thus, blood goes only once\nof oxygen and carbon dioxide through the heart in the fish during one cycle of\n\n92\n\npassage through the body. On the other hand, it goes through the heart\ntwice during each cycle in other vertebrates. This is known as double\ncirculation.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nBlood pressure\nThe force that blood exerts against the wall of a vessel is called blood pressure. This\npressure is much greater in arteries than in veins. The pressure of blood inside the\nartery during ventricular systole (contraction) is called systolic pressure and pressure\nin artery during ventricular diastole (relaxation) is called diastolic pressure. The normal\nsystolic pressure is about 120 mm of Hg and diastolic pressure is 80 mm of Hg.\n\nBlood\n\npressure 120/80\n\n(120 systolic, A\n\n80 diastolic) Pressure Pressure Pressure\n\n(to be measured) in cuff ACuttl in cuff\nabove 120 below 120 below 80\n\nRubber cuff 120\ninflated\nwith air\n\nArtery\nclosed\n\nMore to Know!\n\naudible in\nstethoscope\n\nBlood pressure is measured with an instrument called sphygmomanometer. High\nblood pressure is also called hypertension and is caused by the constriction of\narterioles, which results in increased resistance to blood flow. It can lead to the rupture\nof an artery and internal bleeding.\n\nThe tubes - blood vessels\n\nArteries are the vessels which carry blood away from the heart to various\norgans of the body. Since the blood emerges from the heart under high\npressure, the arteries have thick, elastic walls. Veins collect the blood\nfrom different organs and bring it back to the heart. They do not need\nthick walls because the blood is no longer under pressure, instead they\nhave valves that ensure that the blood flows only in one direction.\n\nOn reaching an organ or tissue, the artery divides into smaller and\nsmaller vessels to bring the blood in contact with all the individual cells.\nThe smallest vessels have walls which are one-cell thick and are called\ncapillaries. Exchange of material between the blood and surrounding\ncells takes place across this thin wall. The capillaries then join together\nto form veins that convey the blood away from the organ or tissue.\n\nMaintenance by platelets\n\nWhat happens if this system of tubes develops a leak? Think about\nsituations when we are injured and start bleeding. Naturally the loss of\nblood from the system has to be minimised. In addition, leakage would\nlead to a loss of pressure which would reduce the efficiency of the\n\nLife Processes 93\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n94\n\npumping system. To avoid this, the blood has platelet cells which circulate\naround the body and plug these leaks by helping to clot the blood at\nthese points of injury.\n\nLymph\n\nThere is another type of fluid also involved in transportation. This is\ncalled lymph or tissue fluid. Through the pores present in the walls of\ncapillaries some amount of plasma, proteins and blood cells escape into\nintercellular spaces in the tissues to form the tissue fluid or lymph. It is\nsimilar to the plasma of blood but colourless and contains less protein.\nLymph drains into lymphatic capillaries from the intercellular spaces,\nwhich join to form large lymph vessels that finally open into larger veins.\nLymph carries digested and absorbed fat from intestine and drains excess\nfluid from extra cellular space back into the blood.\n\n5.4.2 Transportation in Plants\n\nWe have discussed earlier how plants take in simple compounds such\nas CO, and photosynthesise energy stored in their chlorophyll-containing\norgans, namely leaves. The other kinds of raw materials needed for\nbuilding plant bodies will also have to be taken up separately. For plants,\nthe soil is the nearest and richest source of raw materials like nitrogen,\nphosphorus and other minerals. The absorption of these substances\ntherefore occurs through the part in contact with the soil, namely roots.\nIf the distances between soil-contacting organs and chlorophyll-\ncontaining organs are small, energy and raw materials can easily diffuse\nto all parts of the plant body. But if these distances become large because\nof changes in plant body design, diffusion processes will not be sufficient\nto provide raw material in leaves and energy in roots. A proper system of\ntransportation is therefore essential in such situations.\n\nEnergy needs differ between different body designs. Plants do not\nmove, and plant bodies have a large proportion of dead cells in many\ntissues. As a result, plants have low energy needs, and can use relatively\nslow transport systems. The distances over which transport systems\nhave to operate, however, can be very large in plants such as very tall\ntrees.\n\nPlant transport systems will move energy stores from leaves and raw\nmaterials from roots. These two pathways are constructed as\nindependently organised conducting tubes. One, the xylem moves water\nand minerals obtained from the soil. The other, phloem transports\nproducts of photosynthesis from the leaves where they are synthesised\nto other parts of the plant. We have studied the structure of these tissues\nin detail in Class IX.\n\nTransport of water\n\nIn xylem tissue, vessels and tracheids of the roots, stems and leaves are\ninterconnected to form a continuous system of water-conducting\nchannels reaching all parts of the plant. At the roots, cells in contact\nwith the soil actively take up ions. This creates a difference in the\nconcentration of these ions between the root and the soil. Water, therefore,\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nmoves into the root from the soil to eliminate this difference. This means\nthat there is steady movement of water into root xylem, creating a column\nof water that is steadily pushed upwards.\n\nHowever, this pressure by itself is unlikely to be enough to move\nwater over the heights that we commonly see in plants. Plants use another\nstrategy to move water in the xylem upwards to the highest points of the\nplant body.\n\n= Take two small pots of approximately the same size and having\nthe same amount of soil. One should have a plant in it. Place a\nstick of the same height as the plant in the other pot.\n\n= Cover the soil in both pots with a plastic sheet so that moisture\ncannot escape by evaporation.\n\n= Cover both sets, one with the plant and the other with the stick,\nwith plastic sheets and place in bright sunlight for half an hour.\n\n= Do you observe any difference in the two cases?\n\nProvided that the plant has an adequate\nsupply of water, the water which is lost through the\nstomata is replaced by water from the xylem vessels\nin the leaf. In fact, evaporation of water molecules from\nthe cells of a leaf creates a suction which pulls water\nfrom the xylem cells of roots. The loss of water in the\nform of vapour from the aerial parts of the plant is\nknown as transpiration.\n\nThus, transpiration helps in the absorption and\nupward movement of water and minerals dissolved\nin it from roots to the leaves. It also helps in\ntemperature regulation. The effect of root pressure in\ntransport of water is more important at night. During\nthe day when the stomata are open, the transpiration\npull becomes the major driving force in the movement Figure 5.12\nof water in the xylem. Movement of water during transpiration in a tree\n\nTransport of food and other substances\nSo far we have discussed the transport of water and minerals in plants.\nNow let us consider how the products of metabolic processes, particularly\nphotosynthesis, are moved from leaves, where they are formed, to other\nparts of the plant. This transport of soluble products of photosynthesis\nis called translocation and it occurs in the part of the vascular tissue\nknown as phloem. Besides the products of photosynthesis, the phloem\ntransports amino acids and other substances. These substances are\nespecially delivered to the storage organs of roots, fruits and seeds and\nto growing organs. The translocation of food and other substances takes\nplace in the sieve tubes with the help of adjacent companion cells both\nin upward and downward directions.\n\nUnlike transport in xylem which can be largely explained by simple\nphysical forces, the translocation in phloem is achieved by utilising\n\nLife Processes 95\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nenergy. Material like sucrose is transferred into phloem tissue using\nenergy from ATP. This increases the osmotic pressure of the tissue\ncausing water to move into it. This pressure moves the material in the\nphloem to tissues which have less pressure. This allows the phloem to\nmove material according to the plant’s needs. For example, in the spring,\nsugar stored in root or stem tissue would be transported to the buds\nwhich need energy to grow.\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nWhat are the components of the transport system in human beings?\nWhat are the functions of these components?\n\nWhy is it necessary to separate oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in\nmammals and birds?\n\nWhat are the components of the transport system in highly organised\nplants?\n\nHow are water and minerals transported in plants?\nHow is food transported in plants?\n\n5.5 EXCRETION\n\nWe have already discussed how organisms get rid of gaseous wastes\ngenerated during photosynthesis or respiration. Other metabolic activities\ngenerate nitrogenous materials which need to be removed. The biological\nprocess involved in the removal of these harmful metabolic wastes from\nthe body is called excretion. Different organisms use varied strategies to\ndo this. Many unicellular organisms remove these wastes by simple\ndiffusion from the body surface into the surrounding\nwater. As we have seen in other processes, complex\nmulti-cellular organisms use specialised organs to\nperform the same function.\n\nLeft renal\nartery\n\nLeft kidney\n\n5.5.1 Excretion in Human Beings\nLeft renal vei\n\nerenNe The excretory system of human beings (Fig. 5.13)\nAorta\n\nLeft ureter\n\nVena cava\nUrinary bladder\n\nUrethra\n\nFigure 5.13\nExcretory system in human beings\n\n96\n\nincludes a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, a urinary\nbladder and a urethra. Kidneys are located in the\nabdomen, one on either side of the backbone. Urine\nproduced in the kidneys passes through the ureters\ninto the urinary bladder where it is stored until it is\nreleased through the urethra.\n\nHow is urine produced? The purpose of making\nurine is to filter out waste products from the blood.\nJust as CO, is removed from the blood in the lungs,\nnitrogenous waste such as urea or uric acid are\nremoved from blood in the kidneys. It is then no\nsurprise that the basic filtration unit in the kidneys,\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nlike in the lungs, is a cluster of very thin-walled blood\ncapillaries. Each capillary cluster in the kidney is\nassociated with the cup-shaped end of a coiled tube\ncalled Bowman’s capsule that collects the filtrate\n\n(Fig. 5.14). Each kidney has large numbers of these\nfiltration units called nephrons packed close together.\nSome substances in the initial filtrate, such as glucose,\namino acids, salts and a major amount of water, are\nselectively re-absorbed as the urine flows along the tube.\nThe amount of water re-absorbed depends on how much\nexcess water there is in the body, and on how much of\ndissolved waste there is to be excreted. The urine forming\nin each kidney eventually enters a long tube, the ureter,\nwhich connects the kidneys with the urinary bladder.\nUrine is stored in the urinary bladder until the pressure\nof the expanded bladder leads to the urge to pass it out\nthrough the urethra. The bladder is muscular, so it is\nunder nervous control, as we have discussed elsewhere.\nAs a result, we can usually control the urge to urinate.\n\nGlomerulus\nBowman's\ncapsule\n\nTubular part of\nnephron\nBranch\nof renal\nartery\n\nBranch of\nrenal vein\n\nCollecting\nduct\nCapillaries\nFigure 5.14\nStructure of anephron\n\nArtificial kidney (Hemodialysis)\nKidneys are vital organs for survival. Several factors like infections, injury or restricted\nblood flow to kidneys reduce the activity of kidneys. This leads to accumulation of\npoisonous wastes in the body, which can even lead to death. In case of kidney\nfailure, an artificial kidney can be used. An artificial kidney is a device to remove\nnitrogenous waste products from the blood through dialysis.\nArtificial kidneys contain a number of tubes with a semi-permeable lining, suspended\n\nLine from artery\nLo Darap Tubing made of a\nselectively permeable\n\nmembrane\n\nMore to Know!\n\nDialysing i\nsolution\n\nLine from\napparatus\nto vein\n\nFresh\ndialysing\nsolution\n\nUsed dialysing\nsolution (with\nurea and\nexcess salts)\n\nLife Processes\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nin a tank filled with dialysing fluid.\nThis fluid has the same osmotic\npressure as blood, except that it is\ndevoid of nitrogenous wastes. The\npatient’s blood is passed through\nthese tubes. During this passage,\nthe waste products from the blood\npass into dialysing fluid by diffusion.\nThe purified blood is pumped back\ninto the patient. This is similar to the\nfunction of the kidney, but it is\ndifferent since there is no re-\nabsorption involved. Normally, ina\nhealthy adult, the initial filtrate in the\nkidneys is about 180 L daily.\nHowever, the volume actually\nexcreted is only a litre or two a day,\nbecause the remaining filtrate is re-\nabsorbed in the kidney tubules.\n\n97\n\n\nThink it over!\n\nOrgan donation\n\nOrgan donation is a generous act of donating an\norgan to a person who suffers from non-function of\norgan(s). Donation of an organ may be done by the\nconsent of the donor and his/her family. Anyone\nregardless of age or gender can become an organ\nand tissue donor. Organ transplants can save or\ntransform the life of a person. Transplantation is\nrequired because recipient’s organ has been\ndamaged or has failed by disease or injury. In organ\ntransplantation the organ is surgically removed\nfrom one person (organ donor) and transplanted to\nanother person (the recipient). Common\ntransplantations include corneas, kidneys, heart,\nliver, pancreas, lungs, intestines and bone marrow.\nMost organ and tissue donations occur just after\nthe donor has died or when the doctor declares a\nperson brain dead. But some organs such as\nkidney, part of a liver, lung, etc., and tissues can be\ndonated while the donor is alive.\n\n5.5.2 Excretion in Plants\n\nPlants use completely different\nstrategies for excretion than those\nof animals. Oxygen itself can be\nthought of as a waste product\ngenerated during photosynthesis!\nWe have discussed earlier how\nplants deal with oxygen as well as\nCO,. They can get rid of excess water\nby transpiration. For other wastes,\nplants use the fact that many of\ntheir tissues consist of dead cells,\nand that they can even lose some\nparts such as leaves.

If we see a dog running, or a cow chewing cud, or a man\nshouting loudly on the street, we know that these are living beings. What\nif the dog or the cow or the man were asleep? We would still think that\nthey were alive, but how did we know that? We see them breathing, and\nwe know that they are alive. What about plants? How do we know that\nthey are alive? We see them green, some of us will say. But what about\nplants that have leaves of colours other than green? They grow over\ntime, so we know that they are alive, some will say. In other words, we\ntend to think of some sort of movement, either growth-related or not, as\ncommon evidence for being alive. But a plant that is not visibly growing is\nstill alive, and some animals can breathe without visible movement. So\nusing visible movement as the defining characteristic of life is not enough.\n\nMovements over very small scales will be invisible to the naked eye —\nmovements of molecules, for example. Is this invisible molecular\nmovement necessary for life? If we ask this question to professional\nbiologists, they will say yes. In fact, viruses do not show any molecular\nmovement in them (until they infect some cell), and that is partly why\nthere is a controversy about whether they are truly alive or not.\n\nWhy are molecular movements needed for life? We have seen in earlier\nclasses that living organisms are well-organised structures; they can\nhave tissues, tissues have cells, cells have smaller components in them,\nand so on. Because of the effects of the environment, this organised,\nordered nature of living structures is very likely to keep breaking down\nover time. If order breaks down, the organism will no longer be alive. So\nliving creatures must keep repairing and maintaining their structures.\nSince all these structures are made up of molecules, they must move\nmolecules around all the time.\n\nWhat are the maintenance processes in living organisms?\nLet us explore.\n\n5.1 WHAT ARE LIFE PROCESSES?\n\nThe maintenance functions of living organisms must go on even when\nthey are not doing anything particular.

This energy comes from\noutside the body of the individual organism. So there must be a process\nto transfer a source of energy from outside the body of the organism,\nwhich we call food, to the inside, a process we commonly call nutrition.\nIf the body size of the organisms is to grow, additional raw material will\nalso be needed from outside. Since life on earth depends on carbon-\nbased molecules, most of these food sources are also carbon-based.\nDepending on the complexity of these carbon sources, different\norganisms can then use different kinds of nutritional processes.\n\nThe outside sources of energy could be quite varied, since the\nenvironment is not under the control of the individual organism. These\nsources of energy, therefore, need to be broken down or built up in the\nbody, and must be finally converted to a uniform source of energy that\ncan be used for the various molecular movements needed for\nmaintaining living structures, as well as to the kind of molecules the\nbody needs to grow. For this, a series of chemical reactions in the\nbody are necessary. Oxidising-reducing reactions are some of the most\ncommon chemical means to break-down molecules. For this, many\norganisms use oxygen sourced from outside the body. The process\nof acquiring oxygen from outside the body, and to use it in the process\nof break-down of food sources for cellular needs, is what we call\nrespiration.\n\nIn the case of a single-celled organism, no specific organs for taking\nin food, exchange of gases or removal of wastes may be needed because\nthe entire surface of the organism is in contact with the environment.\nBut what happens when the body size of the organism increases and\nthe body design becomes more complex? In multi-cellular organisms,\nall the cells may not be in direct contact with the surrounding\nenvironment. Thus, simple diffusion will not meet the requirements of\nall the cells.\n\nWe have seen previously how, in multi-cellular organisms, various\nbody parts have specialised in the functions they perform. We are familiar\nwith the idea of these specialised tissues, and with their organisation in\nthe body of the organism. It is therefore not surprising that the uptake\nof food and of oxygen will also be the function of specialised tissues.\nHowever, this poses a problem, since the food and oxygen are now taken\nup at one place in the body of the organisms, while all parts of the body\nneed them. This situation creates a need for a transportation system for\ncarrying food and oxygen from one place to another in the body.\n\nWhen chemical reactions use the carbon source and the oxygen for\nenergy generation, they create by-products that are not only useless\nfor the cells of the body, but could even be harmful. These waste by-\nproducts are therefore needed to be removed from the body and discarded\noutside by a process called excretion. Again, if the basic rules for body\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

Even when we\nare not doing any apparent activity, energy is needed to maintain a\nstate of order in our body. We also need materials from outside in order\nto grow, develop, synthesise protein and other substances needed in\nthe body. This source of energy and materials is the food we eat.\n\nHow do living things get their food?\n\nThe general requirement for energy and materials is common in all\norganisms, but it is fulfilled in different ways. Some organisms use simple\nfood material obtained from inorganic sources in the form of carbon\ndioxide and water. These organisms, the autotrophs, include green\nplants and some bacteria. Other organisms utilise complex substances.\nThese complex substances have to be broken down into simpler ones\nbefore they can be used for the upkeep and growth of the body. To\nachieve this, organisms use bio-catalysts called enzymes. Thus, the\nheterotrophs survival depends directly or indirectly on autotrophs.\nHeterotrophic organisms include animals and fungi.\n\n5.2.1 Autotrophic Nutrition\n\nCarbon and energy requirements of the autotrophic organism are\nfulfilled by photosynthesis. It is the process by which autotrophs take\nin substances from the outside and convert them into stored forms of\nenergy. This material is taken in the form of carbon dioxide and water\nwhich is converted into carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight and\nchlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant.\nWe will study how this takes place in the next section. The carbohydrates\nwhich are not used immediately are stored in the form of starch, which\nserves as the internal energy reserve to be used as and when required\nby the plant. A somewhat similar situation is seen in us where some of\nthe energy derived from the food we eat is stored in our body in the form\nof glycogen.\n\nLife Processes 81\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

The form of nutrition\ndiffers depending on the type and availability of food material as well\nas how it is obtained by the organism. For example, whether the food\nsource is stationary (such as grass) or mobile (such as a deer), would\nallow for differences in how the food is accessed and what is the nutritive\napparatus used by a cow and a lion. There is a range of strategies by\nwhich the food is taken in and used by the organism. Some organisms\nbreak-down the food material outside the body and then absorb it.\nExamples are fungi like bread moulds, yeast and mushrooms. Others\ntake in whole material and break it down inside their bodies. What can\nbe taken in and broken down depends on the body design and\nfunctioning.

This parasitic nutritive strategy is used\nby a wide variety of organisms like cuscuta (amar-bel), ticks, lice,\nleeches and tape-worms.\n\n5.2.3 How do Organisms obtain their Nutrition?\n\nSince the food and the way it is obtained differ, the digestive system is\ndifferent in various organisms.

Naturally the food has to be processed to generate\nparticles which are small and of the same texture. This is achieved by\ncrushing the food with our teeth. Since the lining of the canal is soft, the\nfood is also wetted to make its passage smooth. When we eat something\nwe like, our mouth ‘waters’. This is actually not only water, but a fluid\ncalled saliva secreted by the salivary glands. Another aspect of the food\nwe ingest is its complex nature. If it is to be absorbed from the alimentary\ncanal, it has to be broken into smaller molecules. This is done with the\nhelp of biological catalysts called\nenzymes. The saliva contains an\nenzyme called salivary amylase that\nbreaks down starch which is a complex\nmolecule to give simple sugar. The food proneye\nis mixed thoroughly with saliva and\nmoved around the mouth while\nchewing by the muscular tongue.\n\nIt is necessary to move the food in\naregulated manner along the digestive\ntube so that it can be processed\nproperly in each part. The lining of Gall bladder\ncanal has muscles that contract res Pile)\nrhythmically in order to push the food Bile duct\nforward. These peristaltic movements\noccur all along the gut.\n\nFrom the mouth, the food is taken\nto the stomach through the food-pipe\nor oesophagus. The stomach is a large\norgan which expands when food Appendix\nenters it. The muscular walls of the\nstomach help in mixing the food\nthoroughly with more digestive juices.\n\nThe digestion in stomach is taken\ncare of by the gastric glands present in the wall of the stomach. These\nrelease hydrochloric acid, a protein digesting enzyme called pepsin,\nand mucus. The hydrochloric acid creates an acidic medium which\nfacilitates the action of the enzyme pepsin.

Can this be related\nto what has been discussed above?\n\nThe exit of food from the stomach is regulated by a sphincter muscle\nwhich releases it in small amounts into the small intestine. From the\nstomach, the food now enters the small intestine. This is the longest part\nof the alimentary canal which is fitted into a compact space because of\nextensive coiling. The length of the small intestine differs in various\nanimals depending on the food they eat. Herbivores eating grass need a\nlonger small intestine to allow the cellulose to be digested. Meat is easier\nto digest, hence carnivores like tigers have a shorter small intestine.\n\nThe small intestine is the site of the complete digestion of\ncarbohydrates, proteins and fats. It receives the secretions of the liver\nand pancreas for this purpose. The food coming from the stomach is\nacidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act.\nBile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats.\nFats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes\nit difficult for enzymes to act on them. Bile salts break them down into\nsmaller globules increasing the efficiency of enzyme action. This is similar\nto the emulsifying action of soaps on dirt that we have learnt about in\nChapter 4. The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which contains\nenzymes like trypsin for digesting proteins and lipase for breaking down\nemulsified fats. The walls of the small intestine contain glands which\nsecrete intestinal juice. The enzymes present in it finally convert the\nproteins to amino acids, complex carbohydrates into glucose and fats\ninto fatty acids and glycerol.\n\nDigested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner\nlining of the small intestine has numerous finger-like projections called\nvilli which increase the surface area for absorption. The villi are richly\nsupplied with blood vessels which take the absorbed food to each and\nevery cell of the body, where it is utilised for obtaining energy, building\nup new tissues and the repair of old tissues.\n\nThe unabsorbed food is sent into the large intestine where its wall\nabsorb more water from this material. The rest of the material is removed\nfrom the body via the anus. The exit of this waste material is regulated\nby the anal sphincter.\n\nDental caries\n\nDental caries or tooth decay causes gradual softening of enamel and dentine. It begins\nwhen bacteria acting on sugars produce acids that softens or demineralises the enamel.\n\nMasses of bacterial cells together with food particles stick to the teeth to form dental\nplaque. Saliva cannot reach the tooth surface to neutralise the acid as plaque covers\nthe teeth. Brushing the teeth after eating removes the plaque before the bacteria\nproduce acids. If untreated, microorganisms may invade the pulp, causing\ninflammation and infection.\n\n6 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

In all cases, the first step is the break-down of\nglucose, a six-carbon molecule, into a three-carbon molecule called\npyruvate. This process takes place in the cytoplasm. Further, the\npyruvate may be converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process\ntakes place in yeast during fermentation.

The\ncarbon dioxide-rich blood has to reach\nthe lungs for the carbon dioxide to be\nremoved, and the oxygenated blood from\nthe lungs has to be brought back to the\nheart. This oxygen-rich blood is then\npumped to the rest of the body.\n\nWe can follow this process step by\nstep (Fig. 5.11). Oxygen-rich blood from\nthe lungs comes to the thin-walled upper\nchamber of the heart on the left, the left atrium. The left atrium relaxes\nwhen it is collecting this blood. It then contracts, while the next chamber,\nthe left ventricle, relaxes, so that the blood is transferred to it. When the\nmuscular left ventricle contracts in its turn, the blood is pumped out to\nthe body. De-oxygenated blood comes from the body to the upper\nchamber on the right, the right atrium, as it relaxes. As the right atrium\ncontracts, the corresponding lower chamber, the right ventricle, dilates.\nThis transfers blood to the right ventricle, which in turn pumps it to the\nlungs for oxygenation. Since ventricles have to pump blood into various\norgans, they have thicker muscular walls than the atria do. Valves ensure\nthat blood does not flow backwards when the atria or ventricles contract.\n\nPulmonary arteries\n\nLeft ventricle\n\nOxygen enters the blood in the lungs\n\nThe separation of the right side and the left side of\nPimonagrien the heart is useful to keep oxygenated and de-\nfrom lungs oxygenated blood from mixing.

It is\nsimilar to the plasma of blood but colourless and contains less protein.\nLymph drains into lymphatic capillaries from the intercellular spaces,\nwhich join to form large lymph vessels that finally open into larger veins.\nLymph carries digested and absorbed fat from intestine and drains excess\nfluid from extra cellular space back into the blood.\n\n5.4.2 Transportation in Plants\n\nWe have discussed earlier how plants take in simple compounds such\nas CO, and photosynthesise energy stored in their chlorophyll-containing\norgans, namely leaves. The other kinds of raw materials needed for\nbuilding plant bodies will also have to be taken up separately. For plants,\nthe soil is the nearest and richest source of raw materials like nitrogen,\nphosphorus and other minerals. The absorption of these substances\ntherefore occurs through the part in contact with the soil, namely roots.\nIf the distances between soil-contacting organs and chlorophyll-\ncontaining organs are small, energy and raw materials can easily diffuse\nto all parts of the plant body. But if these distances become large because\nof changes in plant body design, diffusion processes will not be sufficient\nto provide raw material in leaves and energy in roots. A proper system of\ntransportation is therefore essential in such situations.\n\nEnergy needs differ between different body designs. Plants do not\nmove, and plant bodies have a large proportion of dead cells in many\ntissues. As a result, plants have low energy needs, and can use relatively\nslow transport systems. The distances over which transport systems\nhave to operate, however, can be very large in plants such as very tall\ntrees.\n\nPlant transport systems will move energy stores from leaves and raw\nmaterials from roots. These two pathways are constructed as\nindependently organised conducting tubes. One, the xylem moves water\nand minerals obtained from the soil. The other, phloem transports\nproducts of photosynthesis from the leaves where they are synthesised\nto other parts of the plant. We have studied the structure of these tissues\nin detail in Class IX.\n\nTransport of water\n\nIn xylem tissue, vessels and tracheids of the roots, stems and leaves are\ninterconnected to form a continuous system of water-conducting\nchannels reaching all parts of the plant. At the roots, cells in contact\nwith the soil actively take up ions. This creates a difference in the\nconcentration of these ions between the root and the soil.

Besides the products of photosynthesis, the phloem\ntransports amino acids and other substances.

There, we had started with\na notion we all have, that ifwe see something moving, it is alive. Some of\nthese movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed\ngerminates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the\ncourse of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But ifits growth\nwere to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some\nmovements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected\nwith growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes\nchewing cud — these are not movements caused by growth.\n\nWhy do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible\nanswer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the\nenvironment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has\nseen a mouse. Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt\nby living organisms to use changes in their environment to their\nadvantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure\nand fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough\nfood so as to be able to digest it better. When bright light is focussed on\nour eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond\nto it with movement in order to protect ourselves.\n\nIf we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this\nmovement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each\nkind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement\nin response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper,\nrather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends\non the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement\nmust be connected to the recognition of various events in the\nenvironment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other\nwords, living organisms must use systems providing control and\ncoordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation\nin multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these\ncontrol and coordination activities.\n\n6.1 ANIMALS —- NERVOUS SYSTEM\n\nIn animals, such control and coordination are provided by nervous and\nmuscular tissues, which we have studied in Class [X. Touching a hot\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nobject is an urgent and dangerous Nuclenw\nsituation for us. We need to detect it,\nand respond to it. How do we detect that\nwe are touching a hot object? All\ninformation from our environment is\ndetected by the specialised tips of some\nnerve cells. These receptors are usually\nlocated in our sense organs, such as the\ninner ear, the nose, the tongue, and so\non. So gustatory receptors will detect taste\nwhile olfactory receptors will detect smell.\n\nThis information, acquired at the Nenonenaar\nend of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell\n[Fig. 6.1 (a)], sets off a chemical reaction\nthat creates an electrical impulse. This\nimpulse travels from the dendrite to the\ncell body, and then along the axon to its\nend. At the end of the axon, the electrical\nimpulse sets off the release of some\nchemicals. These chemicals cross the\ngap, or synapse, and start a similar\nelectrical impulse in a dendrite of the next\nneuron. This is a general scheme of how\nnervous impulses travel in the body. A\nsimilar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to\nother cells, such as muscles cells or gland [Fig. 6.1 (b)].\n\nIt is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised\nnetwork of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting\ninformation via electrical impulses from one part of the body to another.\n\nLook at Fig. 6.1 (a) and identify the parts of a neuron (i) where\ninformation is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an\nelectrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a\nchemical signal for onward transmission.\n\nActivity 6.1 |\n\n= Put some sugar in your mouth. How does it taste?\n\n= Block your nose by pressing it between your thumb and index\nfinger. Now eat sugar again. Is there any difference in its taste?\n\n= While eating lunch, block your nose in the same way and notice if\nyou can fully appreciate the taste of the food you are eating.\n\nCell body\n\n(a)\n\nMitochondrion\n\nFigure 6.1 (a) Structure of neuron, (b) Neuromuscular\njunction\n\nIs there a difference in how sugar and food taste if your nose is\nblocked? If so, why might this be happening? Read and talk about\npossible explanations for these kinds of differences. Do you come across\na similar situation when you have a cold?\n\nControl and Coordination 101\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n102\n\n6.1.1 What happens in Reflex Actions?\n\n‘Reflex’ is a word we use very commonly when we talk about some sudden\naction in response to something in the environment. We say ‘I jumped\nout of the way of the bus reflexly’, or ‘I pulled my hand back from the\nflame reflexly’, or ‘I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly’.\nWhat exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that\nwe do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control\nof our reactions. Yet these are situations where we are responding with\nsome action to changes in our environment. How is control and\ncoordination achieved in such situations?\n\nLet us consider this further. Take one of our examples. Touching a\nflame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any\nanimal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to\nthink consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt,\nand therefore move our hand. An important question then is, how long\nwill it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think. If\nnerve impulses are sent around the way we have talked about earlier,\nthen thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses.\nThinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated\ninteraction of many nerve impulses from many neurons.\n\nIf this is the case, it is no surprise that the thinking tissue in our\nbody consists of dense networks of intricately arranged neurons. It sits\nin the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the\nbody which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in\norder to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull\nmust be connected to nerves coming from various parts of the body.\nSimilarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, nerves\nmust carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is\nto be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to\nget burnt!\n\nHow does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than\nhaving to think about the sensation of heat, if the nerves that detect heat\nwere to be connected to the nerves that move muscles in a simpler way,\nthe process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by\nan output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is\ncommonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 6.2). Where should such reflex arc\nconnections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve?\nThe best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet\neach other. Nerves from all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal\ncord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord\nitself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain.\n\nOf course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking\nprocess of the brain is not fast enough. In fact many animals have very\nlittle or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So it is\nquite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning\nin the absence of true thought processes. However, even after complex\nneuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be\nmore efficient for quick responses.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nMessage to\nbrain\n\nSpinal cord\n(CNS)\n\nSensory neuron\n\nMotor\nneuron\n\nReceptors = Heat/Pain Relay neuron\n\nReceptors in skin\nEffector = Muscle in arm\n\nFigure 6.2 Reflex arc\n\nCan you now trace the sequence of events which occur when a bright\nlight is focussed on your eyes?\n\n6.1.2 Human Brain\n\nIs reflex action the only function of the spinal cord? Obviously not, since\nwe know that we are thinking beings. Spinal cord is made up of nerves\nwhich supply information to think about. Thinking involves more\ncomplex mechanisms and neural connections. These are concentrated\nin the brain, which is the main coordinating centre of the body. The\nbrain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system (Fig. 6.3).\nThey receive information from all parts of the body and integrate it.\n\nWe also think about our actions. Writing, talking, moving a chair,\nclapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions\nwhich are based on deciding what to do next. So, the brain also has to\nsend messages to muscles. This is the second way in which the nervous\nsystem communicates with the muscles. The communication between\nthe central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated\nby the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising\nfrom the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain\nthus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking. As you\nwill expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different\nparts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs.\nThe brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain,\nmid-brain and hind-brain.\n\nThe fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions\nwhich receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas\nof the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on. There\nare separate areas of association where this sensory information is\ninterpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors\nas well as with information that is already stored in the brain. Based on\n\nControl and Coordination 103\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n104\n\nFore-Brain\n\nall this, a decision is made about how to respond and the information is\npassed on to the motor areas which control the movement of voluntary\nmuscles, for example, our leg muscles. However, certain sensations are\ndistinct from seeing or hearing, for example, how do we know that we\nhave eaten enough? The sensation of feeling full is because of a centre\nassociated with hunger, which is in a separate part of the fore-brain.\n\nCerebrum\n\nCranium (skull)\n\naN\n\nMid-brain\n\nPituitary gland\n\nHind-brain |\n\nCerebellum Spinal cord\n\nFigure 6.3 Human brain\n\nStudy the labelled diagram of the human brain. We have seen that\nthe different parts have specific functions. Can we find out the function\nof each part?\n\nLet us look at the other use of the word ‘reflex’ that we have talked\nabout in the introduction. Our mouth waters when we see food we like\nwithout our meaning to. Our hearts beat without our thinking about it.\nIn fact, we cannot control these actions easily by thinking about them\neven if we wanted to. Do we have to think about or remember to breathe\nor digest food? So, in between the simple reflex actions like change in\nthe size of the pupil, and the thought out actions such as moving a\nchair, there is another set of muscle movements over which we do not\nhave any thinking control. Many of these involuntary actions are\ncontrolled by the mid-brain and hind-brain. All these involuntary actions\nincluding blood pressure, salivation and vomiting are controlled by the\nmedulla in the hind-brain.\n\nThink about activities like walking in a straight line, riding a bicycle,\npicking up a pencil. These are possible due to a part of the hind-brain\ncalled the cerebellum. It is responsible for precision of voluntary actions\nand maintaining the posture and balance of the body. Imagine what\nwould happen if each of these events failed to take place if we were not\nthinking about it.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n6.1.3 How are these Tissues protected?\n\nA delicate organ like the brain, which is so important for a variety of\nactivities, needs to be carefully protected. For this, the body is designed\nso that the brain sits inside a bony box. Inside the box, the brain is\ncontained in a fluid-filled balloon which provides further shock\nabsorption. If you run your hand down the middle of your back, you\nwill feel a hard, bumpy structure. This is the vertebral column or\nbackbone which protects the spinal cord.\n\n6.1.4 How does the Nervous Tissue cause Action?\n\nSo far, we have been talking about nervous tissue, and how it collects\ninformation, sends it around the body, processes information, makes\ndecisions based on information, and conveys decisions to muscles for\naction. In other words, when the action or movement is to be performed,\nmuscle tissue will do the final job. How do animal muscles move? When\na nerve impulse reaches the muscle, the muscle fibre must move. How\ndoes a muscle cell move? The simplest notion of movement at the cellular\nlevel is that muscle cells will move by changing their shape so that they\nshorten. So the next question is, how do muscle cells change their shape?\nThe answer must lie in the chemistry of cellular components. Muscle\ncells have special proteins that change both their shape and their\narrangement in the cell in response to nervous electrical impulses. When\nthis happens, new arrangements of these proteins give the muscle cells\na shorter form. Remember when we talked about muscle tissue in\nClass IX, there were different kinds of muscles, such as voluntary muscles\nand involuntary muscles. Based on what we have discussed so far, what\ndo you think the differences between these would be?\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nWhat is the difference between a reflex action and walking?\n\nWhat happens at the synapse between two neurons?\n\nWhich part of the brain maintains posture and equilibrium of the body?\n\nHow do we detect the smell of an agarbatti (incense stick)?\n\nWhat is the role of the brain in reflex action?\n\n6.2 COORDINATION IN PLANTS\n\nAnimals have a nervous system for controlling and coordinating the\nactivities of the body. But plants have neither a nervous system nor\nmuscles. So, how do they respond to stimuli? When we touch the leaves\nof a chhui-mui (the ‘sensitive’ or ‘touch-me-not’ plant of the Mimosa\nfamily), they begin to fold up and droop. When a seed germinates, the\nroot goes down, the stem comes up into the air. What happens? Firstly,\nthe leaves of the sensitive plant move very quickly in response to touch.\n\nControl and Coordination 105\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n106\n\nThere is no growth involved in this movement. On the other hand, the\ndirectional movement of a seedling is caused by growth. Ifit is prevented\nfrom growing, it will not show any movement. So plants show two different\ntypes of movement — one dependent on growth and the other independent\nof growth.\n\n6.2.1 Immediate Response to Stimulus\n\nLet us think about the first kind of movement, such as that of the sensitive\nplant. Since no growth is involved, the plant must actually move its leaves\nin response to touch. But there is no nervous tissue, nor any muscle\ntissue. How does the plant detect the touch, and how do the leaves move\nin response?\n\nFigure 6.4 The sensitive plant\n\nIf we think about where exactly the plant is touched, and what part\nof the plant actually moves, it is apparent that movement happens ata\npoint different from the point of touch. So, information that a touch has\noccurred must be communicated. The plants also use electrical-chemical\nmeans to convey this information from cell to cell, but unlike in animals,\nthere is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information.\nFinally, again as in animals, some cells must change shape in order for\nmovement to happen. Instead of the specialised proteins found in animal\nmuscle cells, plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water\nin them, resulting in swelling or shrinking, and therefore in changing\nshapes (Fig. 6.4).\n\n6.2.2 Movement Due to Growth\n\nSome plants like the pea plant climb up other plants or fences by means\nof tendrils. These tendrils are sensitive to touch. When they come in\ncontact with any support, the part of the tendril in contact with the object\ndoes not grow as rapidly as the part of the tendril away from the object.\nThis causes the tendril to circle around the object and thus cling to it.\nMore commonly, plants respond to stimuli slowly by growing in a\nparticular direction. Because this growth is directional, it appears as if\nthe plant is moving. Let us understand this type of movement with the\nhelp of an example.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n= Fill a conical flask with water.\n\n= Cover the neck of the flask with a wire mesh.\n\n= Keep two or three freshly germinated bean\nseeds on the wire mesh.\n\n= Take a cardboard box which is open from one\nside.\n\n= Keep the flask in the box in such a manner\nthat the open side of the box faces light coming\nfrom a window (Fig. 6.5).\n\n= After two or three days, you will notice that\nthe shoots bend towards light and roots away\nfrom light.\n\n= Now turn the flask so that the shoots are away\nfrom light and the roots towards light. Leave it\nundisturbed in this condition for a few days.\n\n= Have the old parts of the shoot and root\nchanged direction?\n\n= Are there differences in the direction of the new\ngrowth?\n\n= What can we conclude from this activity?\n\nFigure 6.5\nResponse of the plant to the direction of light\n\nNegatively\ngeotropic\nEnvironmental triggers such as light, or gravity\nwill change the directions that plant parts grow in.\nThese directional, or tropic, movements can be either\ntowards the stimulus, or away from it. So, in two\ndifferent kinds of phototropic movement, shoots\nrespond by bending towards light while roots\nrespond by bending away from it. How does this help Figure 6.6 Plant showing geotropism\nthe plant?\nPlants show tropism in response to other stimuli as well. The roots\nof a plant always grow downwards while the shoots usually grow\nupwards and away from the earth. This upward and downward growth\nof shoots and roots, respectively, in response to the pull of earth or gravity\nis, obviously, geotropism (Fig. 6.6). If ‘hydro’ means water and ‘chemo’\nrefers to chemicals, what would ‘hydrotropism’ and ‘chemotropism’\nmean? Can we think of examples of these kinds of directional growth\nmovements? One example of chemotropism is the growth of pollen tubes\ntowards ovules, about which we will learn more when we examine the\nreproductive processes of living organisms.\nLet us now once again think about how information is communicated\nin the bodies of multicellular organisms. The movement of the\nsensitive plant in response to touch is very quick. The movement of\nsunflowers in response to day or night, on the other hand, is quite slow.\nGrowth-related movement of plants will be even slower.\nEven in animal bodies, there are carefully controlled directions to\ngrowth. Our arms and fingers grow in certain directions, not haphazardly.\nSo controlled movements can be either slow or fast. If fast responses to\nstimuli are to be made, information transfer must happen very quickly.\nFor this, the medium of transmission must be able to move rapidly.\n\nPositively\ngeotropic\n\nControl and Coordination 107\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nElectrical impulses are an excellent means for this. But there are\nlimitations to the use of electrical impulses. Firstly, they will reach only\nthose cells that are connected by nervous tissue, not each and every cell\nin the animal body. Secondly, once an electrical impulse is generated in\na cell and transmitted, the cell will take some time to reset its mechanisms\nbefore it can generate and transmit a new impulse. In other words, cells\ncannot continually create and transmit electrical impulses. It is thus no\nwonder that most multicellular organisms use another means of\ncommunication between cells, namely, chemical communication.\n\nIf, instead of generating an electrical impulse, stimulated cells release\na chemical compound, this compound would diffuse all around the\noriginal cell. If other cells around have the means to detect this compound\nusing special molecules on their surfaces, then they would be able to\nrecognise information, and even transmit it. This will be slower, of course,\nbut it can potentially reach all cells of the body, regardless of nervous\nconnections, and it can be done steadily and persistently. These\ncompounds, or hormones used by multicellular organisms for control\nand coordination show a great deal of diversity, as we would expect.\nDifferent plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and\nresponses to the environment. They are synthesised at places away from\nwhere they act and simply diffuse to the area of action.\n\nLet us take an example that we have worked with earlier [Activity 6.2].\nWhen growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin, synthesised\nat the shoot tip, helps the cells to grow longer. When light is coming from\none side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot.\nThis concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the\nside of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to\nbend towards light.\n\nAnother example of plant hormones are gibberellins which, like\nauxins, help in the growth of the stem. Cytokinins promote cell division,\nand it is natural then that they are present in greater concentration in\nareas of rapid cell division, such as in fruits and seeds. These are examples\nof plant hormones that help in promoting growth. But plants also need\nsignals to stop growing. Abscisic acid is one example of a hormone which\ninhibits growth. Its effects include wilting of leaves.\n\nQ U ES TION S$\n\nWhat are plant hormones?\n\nHow is the movement of leaves of the sensitive plant different from the\nmovement of a shoot towards light?\n\nGive an example of a plant hormone that promotes growth.\n\nHow do auxins promote the growth of a tendril around a support?\n\nDesign an experiment to demonstrate hydrotropism.\n\n108 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n6.3 HORMONES IN ANIMALS\n\nHow are such chemical, or hormonal, means of information transmission\nused in animals? What do some animals, for instance squirrels,\nexperience when they are in a scary situation? Their bodies have to\nprepare for either fighting or running away. Both are very complicated\nactivities that will use a great deal of energy in controlled ways. Many\ndifferent tissue types will be used and their activities integrated together\nin these actions. However, the two alternate activities, fighting or running,\nare also quite different! So here is a situation in which some common\npreparations can be usefully made in the body. These preparations\nshould ideally make it easier to do either activity in the near future. How\nwould this be achieved?\n\nIf the body design in the squirrel relied only on electrical impulses\nvia nerve cells, the range of tissues instructed to prepare for the coming\nactivity would be limited. On the other hand, if a chemical signal were to\nbe sent as well, it would reach all cells of the body and provide the wide-\nranging changes needed. This is done in many animals, including human\nbeings, using a hormone called adrenaline that is secreted from the\nadrenal glands. Look at Fig. 6.7 to locate these glands.\n\nAdrenaline is secreted directly into the blood and carried to different\nparts of the body. The target organs or the specific tissues on which it\nacts include the heart. As a result, the heart beats faster, resulting in\nsupply of more oxygen to our muscles. The blood to the digestive system\nand skin is reduced due to contraction of muscles around small arteries\nin these organs. This diverts the blood to our skeletal muscles. The\nbreathing rate also increases because of the contractions of the\ndiaphragm and the rib muscles. All these responses together enable the\nanimal body to be ready to deal with the situation. Such animal hormones\nare part of the endocrine system which constitutes a second way of control\nand coordination in our body.\n\n= Look at Fig. 6.7.\n\n= Identify the endocrine glands mentioned in the figure.\n\n= Some of these glands have been listed in Table 6.1 and discussed\nin the text. Consult books in the library and discuss with your\nteachers to find out about other glands.\n\nRemember that plants have hormones that control their directional\ngrowth. What functions do animal hormones perform? On the face of it,\nwe cannot imagine their role in directional growth. We have never seen\nan animal growing more in one direction or the other, depending on\nlight or gravity! But if we think about it a bit more, it will become evident\nthat, even in animal bodies, growth happens in carefully controlled places.\nPlants will grow leaves in many places on the plant body, for example.\nBut we do not grow fingers on our faces. The design of the body is carefully\nmaintained even during the growth of children.\n\nControl and Coordination\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n109\n\n\nHypothalamus\n\nParathyroid\nglands\nThymus\n\nPancreas\n\nTestis\n\n(a)\n\nHypothalamus plays\nan important role in\nthe release of many\nhormones. For\nexample, when the\nlevel of growth\n\nhormone is low, the\nhypothalamus\nreleases growth\nhormone releasing\nfactor which\nstimulates the g\npituitary gland to |\nrelease growth\nhormone.\n\n110\n\ni ~_— Thyroid gland\n\nPineal gland Pineal gland\n\nPituit land\nuitary glan Pituitary gland\n\nThyroid gland\n\nAdrenal glands\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.7 Endocrine glands in human beings (a) male, (b) female\n\nLet us examine some examples to understand how hormones help\nin coordinated growth. We have all seen salt packets which say ‘iodised\nsalt’ or ‘enriched with iodine’. Why is it important for us to have iodised\nsalt in our diet? Iodine is necessary for the thyroid gland to make\nthyroxin hormone. Thyroxin regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat\nmetabolism in the body so as to provide the best balance for growth.\nIodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroxin. In case iodine is deficient\nin our diet, there is a possibility that we might suffer from goitre. One\nof the symptoms in this disease is a swollen neck. Can you correlate\nthis with the position of the thyroid gland in Fig. 6.7?\n\nSometimes we come across people who are either very short (dwarfs)\nor extremely tall (giants). Have you ever wondered how this happens?\nGrowth hormone is one of the hormones secreted by the pituitary. As\nits name indicates, growth hormone regulates growth and development\nof the body. If there is a deficiency of this hormone in childhood, it\nleads to dwarfism.\n\nYou must have noticed many dramatic changes in your appearance\nas well as that of your friends as you approached 10-12 years of age.\nThese changes associated with puberty are because of the secretion of\ntestosterone in males and oestrogen in females.\n\nDo you know anyone in your family or friends who has been advised\nby the doctor to take less sugar in their diet because they are suffering\nfrom diabetes? As a treatment, they might be taking injections of insulin.\nThis is a hormone which is produced by the pancreas and helps in\nregulating blood sugar levels. If it is not secreted in proper amounts,\nthe sugar level in the blood rises causing many harmful effects.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nIf it is so important that hormones should be secreted in precise\nquantities, we need a mechanism through which this is done. The timing\nand amount of hormone released are regulated by feedback mechanisms.\nFor example, if the sugar levels in blood rise, they are detected by the\ncells of the pancreas which respond by producing more insulin. As the\nblood sugar level falls, insulin secretion is reduced.\n\n= Hormones are secreted by endocrine glands and have specific functions.

        "text": "OF\n\n1064CHO7\n\nCHAPTER 6\nControl and\nCoordination\n\nn the previous chapter, we looked at life processes involved in the\n\nmaintenance functions in living organisms. There, we had started with\na notion we all have, that ifwe see something moving, it is alive. Some of\nthese movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed\ngerminates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the\ncourse of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But ifits growth\nwere to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some\nmovements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected\nwith growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes\nchewing cud — these are not movements caused by growth.\n\nWhy do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible\nanswer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the\nenvironment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has\nseen a mouse. Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt\nby living organisms to use changes in their environment to their\nadvantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure\nand fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough\nfood so as to be able to digest it better. When bright light is focussed on\nour eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond\nto it with movement in order to protect ourselves.\n\nIf we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this\nmovement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each\nkind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement\nin response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper,\nrather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends\non the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement\nmust be connected to the recognition of various events in the\nenvironment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other\nwords, living organisms must use systems providing control and\ncoordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation\nin multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these\ncontrol and coordination activities.\n\n6.1 ANIMALS —- NERVOUS SYSTEM\n\nIn animals, such control and coordination are provided by nervous and\nmuscular tissues, which we have studied in Class [X.

        "text": "object is an urgent and dangerous Nuclenw\nsituation for us. We need to detect it,\nand respond to it. How do we detect that\nwe are touching a hot object? All\ninformation from our environment is\ndetected by the specialised tips of some\nnerve cells. These receptors are usually\nlocated in our sense organs, such as the\ninner ear, the nose, the tongue, and so\non. So gustatory receptors will detect taste\nwhile olfactory receptors will detect smell.\n\nThis information, acquired at the Nenonenaar\nend of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell\n[Fig. 6.1 (a)], sets off a chemical reaction\nthat creates an electrical impulse. This\nimpulse travels from the dendrite to the\ncell body, and then along the axon to its\nend. At the end of the axon, the electrical\nimpulse sets off the release of some\nchemicals. These chemicals cross the\ngap, or synapse, and start a similar\nelectrical impulse in a dendrite of the next\nneuron. This is a general scheme of how\nnervous impulses travel in the body. A\nsimilar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to\nother cells, such as muscles cells or gland [Fig. 6.1 (b)].\n\nIt is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised\nnetwork of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting\ninformation via electrical impulses from one part of the body to another.\n\nLook at Fig. 6.1 (a) and identify the parts of a neuron (i) where\ninformation is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an\nelectrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a\nchemical signal for onward transmission.\n\nActivity 6.1 |\n\n= Put some sugar in your mouth.

        "text": "102\n\n6.1.1 What happens in Reflex Actions?\n\n‘Reflex’ is a word we use very commonly when we talk about some sudden\naction in response to something in the environment. We say ‘I jumped\nout of the way of the bus reflexly’, or ‘I pulled my hand back from the\nflame reflexly’, or ‘I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly’.\nWhat exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that\nwe do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control\nof our reactions. Yet these are situations where we are responding with\nsome action to changes in our environment. How is control and\ncoordination achieved in such situations?\n\nLet us consider this further. Take one of our examples. Touching a\nflame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any\nanimal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to\nthink consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt,\nand therefore move our hand. An important question then is, how long\nwill it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think. If\nnerve impulses are sent around the way we have talked about earlier,\nthen thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses.\nThinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated\ninteraction of many nerve impulses from many neurons.\n\nIf this is the case, it is no surprise that the thinking tissue in our\nbody consists of dense networks of intricately arranged neurons. It sits\nin the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the\nbody which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in\norder to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull\nmust be connected to nerves coming from various parts of the body.\nSimilarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, nerves\nmust carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is\nto be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to\nget burnt!\n\nHow does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than\nhaving to think about the sensation of heat, if the nerves that detect heat\nwere to be connected to the nerves that move muscles in a simpler way,\nthe process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by\nan output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is\ncommonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 6.2). Where should such reflex arc\nconnections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve?\nThe best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet\neach other. Nerves from all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal\ncord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord\nitself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain.\n\nOf course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking\nprocess of the brain is not fast enough. In fact many animals have very\nlittle or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So it is\nquite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning\nin the absence of true thought processes. However, even after complex\nneuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be\nmore efficient for quick responses.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

Obviously not, since\nwe know that we are thinking beings. Spinal cord is made up of nerves\nwhich supply information to think about. Thinking involves more\ncomplex mechanisms and neural connections. These are concentrated\nin the brain, which is the main coordinating centre of the body. The\nbrain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system (Fig. 6.3).\nThey receive information from all parts of the body and integrate it.\n\nWe also think about our actions. Writing, talking, moving a chair,\nclapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions\nwhich are based on deciding what to do next. So, the brain also has to\nsend messages to muscles. This is the second way in which the nervous\nsystem communicates with the muscles. The communication between\nthe central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated\nby the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising\nfrom the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain\nthus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking. As you\nwill expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different\nparts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs.\nThe brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain,\nmid-brain and hind-brain.\n\nThe fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions\nwhich receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas\nof the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on. There\nare separate areas of association where this sensory information is\ninterpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors\nas well as with information that is already stored in the brain.

However, certain sensations are\ndistinct from seeing or hearing, for example, how do we know that we\nhave eaten enough?

Can we find out the function\nof each part?\n\nLet us look at the other use of the word ‘reflex’ that we have talked\nabout in the introduction. Our mouth waters when we see food we like\nwithout our meaning to. Our hearts beat without our thinking about it.\nIn fact, we cannot control these actions easily by thinking about them\neven if we wanted to. Do we have to think about or remember to breathe\nor digest food? So, in between the simple reflex actions like change in\nthe size of the pupil, and the thought out actions such as moving a\nchair, there is another set of muscle movements over which we do not\nhave any thinking control. Many of these involuntary actions are\ncontrolled by the mid-brain and hind-brain. All these involuntary actions\nincluding blood pressure, salivation and vomiting are controlled by the\nmedulla in the hind-brain.\n\nThink about activities like walking in a straight line, riding a bicycle,\npicking up a pencil. These are possible due to a part of the hind-brain\ncalled the cerebellum. It is responsible for precision of voluntary actions\nand maintaining the posture and balance of the body. Imagine what\nwould happen if each of these events failed to take place if we were not\nthinking about it.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

        "text": "6.1.3 How are these Tissues protected?\n\nA delicate organ like the brain, which is so important for a variety of\nactivities, needs to be carefully protected. For this, the body is designed\nso that the brain sits inside a bony box. Inside the box, the brain is\ncontained in a fluid-filled balloon which provides further shock\nabsorption. If you run your hand down the middle of your back, you\nwill feel a hard, bumpy structure. This is the vertebral column or\nbackbone which protects the spinal cord.\n\n6.1.4 How does the Nervous Tissue cause Action?\n\nSo far, we have been talking about nervous tissue, and how it collects\ninformation, sends it around the body, processes information, makes\ndecisions based on information, and conveys decisions to muscles for\naction. In other words, when the action or movement is to be performed,\nmuscle tissue will do the final job. How do animal muscles move? When\na nerve impulse reaches the muscle, the muscle fibre must move. How\ndoes a muscle cell move? The simplest notion of movement at the cellular\nlevel is that muscle cells will move by changing their shape so that they\nshorten. So the next question is, how do muscle cells change their shape?\nThe answer must lie in the chemistry of cellular components. Muscle\ncells have special proteins that change both their shape and their\narrangement in the cell in response to nervous electrical impulses. When\nthis happens, new arrangements of these proteins give the muscle cells\na shorter form. Remember when we talked about muscle tissue in\nClass IX, there were different kinds of muscles, such as voluntary muscles\nand involuntary muscles.

But plants have neither a nervous system nor\nmuscles. So, how do they respond to stimuli? When we touch the leaves\nof a chhui-mui (the ‘sensitive’ or ‘touch-me-not’ plant of the Mimosa\nfamily), they begin to fold up and droop. When a seed germinates, the\nroot goes down, the stem comes up into the air. What happens? Firstly,\nthe leaves of the sensitive plant move very quickly in response to touch.\n\nControl and Coordination 105\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

Ifit is prevented\nfrom growing, it will not show any movement. So plants show two different\ntypes of movement — one dependent on growth and the other independent\nof growth.\n\n6.2.1 Immediate Response to Stimulus\n\nLet us think about the first kind of movement, such as that of the sensitive\nplant. Since no growth is involved, the plant must actually move its leaves\nin response to touch. But there is no nervous tissue, nor any muscle\ntissue. How does the plant detect the touch, and how do the leaves move\nin response?\n\nFigure 6.4 The sensitive plant\n\nIf we think about where exactly the plant is touched, and what part\nof the plant actually moves, it is apparent that movement happens ata\npoint different from the point of touch. So, information that a touch has\noccurred must be communicated. The plants also use electrical-chemical\nmeans to convey this information from cell to cell, but unlike in animals,\nthere is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information.\nFinally, again as in animals, some cells must change shape in order for\nmovement to happen. Instead of the specialised proteins found in animal\nmuscle cells, plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water\nin them, resulting in swelling or shrinking, and therefore in changing\nshapes (Fig. 6.4).\n\n6.2.2 Movement Due to Growth\n\nSome plants like the pea plant climb up other plants or fences by means\nof tendrils. These tendrils are sensitive to touch. When they come in\ncontact with any support, the part of the tendril in contact with the object\ndoes not grow as rapidly as the part of the tendril away from the object.\nThis causes the tendril to circle around the object and thus cling to it.\nMore commonly, plants respond to stimuli slowly by growing in a\nparticular direction. Because this growth is directional, it appears as if\nthe plant is moving. Let us understand this type of movement with the\nhelp of an example.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

So, in two\ndifferent kinds of phototropic movement, shoots\nrespond by bending towards light while roots\nrespond by bending away from it. How does this help Figure 6.6 Plant showing geotropism\nthe plant?\nPlants show tropism in response to other stimuli as well. The roots\nof a plant always grow downwards while the shoots usually grow\nupwards and away from the earth. This upward and downward growth\nof shoots and roots, respectively, in response to the pull of earth or gravity\nis, obviously, geotropism (Fig. 6.6). If ‘hydro’ means water and ‘chemo’\nrefers to chemicals, what would ‘hydrotropism’ and ‘chemotropism’\nmean? Can we think of examples of these kinds of directional growth\nmovements? One example of chemotropism is the growth of pollen tubes\ntowards ovules, about which we will learn more when we examine the\nreproductive processes of living organisms.\nLet us now once again think about how information is communicated\nin the bodies of multicellular organisms. The movement of the\nsensitive plant in response to touch is very quick. The movement of\nsunflowers in response to day or night, on the other hand, is quite slow.\nGrowth-related movement of plants will be even slower.\nEven in animal bodies, there are carefully controlled directions to\ngrowth. Our arms and fingers grow in certain directions, not haphazardly.\nSo controlled movements can be either slow or fast.

        "text": "Electrical impulses are an excellent means for this. But there are\nlimitations to the use of electrical impulses. Firstly, they will reach only\nthose cells that are connected by nervous tissue, not each and every cell\nin the animal body. Secondly, once an electrical impulse is generated in\na cell and transmitted, the cell will take some time to reset its mechanisms\nbefore it can generate and transmit a new impulse. In other words, cells\ncannot continually create and transmit electrical impulses. It is thus no\nwonder that most multicellular organisms use another means of\ncommunication between cells, namely, chemical communication.\n\nIf, instead of generating an electrical impulse, stimulated cells release\na chemical compound, this compound would diffuse all around the\noriginal cell. If other cells around have the means to detect this compound\nusing special molecules on their surfaces, then they would be able to\nrecognise information, and even transmit it. This will be slower, of course,\nbut it can potentially reach all cells of the body, regardless of nervous\nconnections, and it can be done steadily and persistently. These\ncompounds, or hormones used by multicellular organisms for control\nand coordination show a great deal of diversity, as we would expect.\nDifferent plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and\nresponses to the environment. They are synthesised at places away from\nwhere they act and simply diffuse to the area of action.\n\nLet us take an example that we have worked with earlier [Activity 6.2].\nWhen growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin, synthesised\nat the shoot tip, helps the cells to grow longer. When light is coming from\none side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot.\nThis concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the\nside of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to\nbend towards light.\n\nAnother example of plant hormones are gibberellins which, like\nauxins, help in the growth of the stem. Cytokinins promote cell division,\nand it is natural then that they are present in greater concentration in\nareas of rapid cell division, such as in fruits and seeds. These are examples\nof plant hormones that help in promoting growth. But plants also need\nsignals to stop growing. Abscisic acid is one example of a hormone which\ninhibits growth.

        "text": "6.3 HORMONES IN ANIMALS\n\nHow are such chemical, or hormonal, means of information transmission\nused in animals? What do some animals, for instance squirrels,\nexperience when they are in a scary situation? Their bodies have to\nprepare for either fighting or running away. Both are very complicated\nactivities that will use a great deal of energy in controlled ways. Many\ndifferent tissue types will be used and their activities integrated together\nin these actions. However, the two alternate activities, fighting or running,\nare also quite different! So here is a situation in which some common\npreparations can be usefully made in the body. These preparations\nshould ideally make it easier to do either activity in the near future. How\nwould this be achieved?\n\nIf the body design in the squirrel relied only on electrical impulses\nvia nerve cells, the range of tissues instructed to prepare for the coming\nactivity would be limited. On the other hand, if a chemical signal were to\nbe sent as well, it would reach all cells of the body and provide the wide-\nranging changes needed. This is done in many animals, including human\nbeings, using a hormone called adrenaline that is secreted from the\nadrenal glands. Look at Fig. 6.7 to locate these glands.\n\nAdrenaline is secreted directly into the blood and carried to different\nparts of the body. The target organs or the specific tissues on which it\nacts include the heart. As a result, the heart beats faster, resulting in\nsupply of more oxygen to our muscles. The blood to the digestive system\nand skin is reduced due to contraction of muscles around small arteries\nin these organs. This diverts the blood to our skeletal muscles. The\nbreathing rate also increases because of the contractions of the\ndiaphragm and the rib muscles. All these responses together enable the\nanimal body to be ready to deal with the situation. Such animal hormones\nare part of the endocrine system which constitutes a second way of control\nand coordination in our body.\n\n= Look at Fig. 6.7.\n\n= Identify the endocrine glands mentioned in the figure.\n\n= Some of these glands have been listed in Table 6.1 and discussed\nin the text.

What functions do animal hormones perform? On the face of it,\nwe cannot imagine their role in directional growth. We have never seen\nan animal growing more in one direction or the other, depending on\nlight or gravity! But if we think about it a bit more, it will become evident\nthat, even in animal bodies, growth happens in carefully controlled places.\nPlants will grow leaves in many places on the plant body, for example.\nBut we do not grow fingers on our faces.

Thyroxin regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat\nmetabolism in the body so as to provide the best balance for growth.\nIodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroxin. In case iodine is deficient\nin our diet, there is a possibility that we might suffer from goitre. One\nof the symptoms in this disease is a swollen neck. Can you correlate\nthis with the position of the thyroid gland in Fig. 6.7?\n\nSometimes we come across people who are either very short (dwarfs)\nor extremely tall (giants).

If there is a deficiency of this hormone in childhood, it\nleads to dwarfism.\n\nYou must have noticed many dramatic changes in your appearance\nas well as that of your friends as you approached 10-12 years of age.\nThese changes associated with puberty are because of the secretion of\ntestosterone in males and oestrogen in females.\n\nDo you know anyone in your family or friends who has been advised\nby the doctor to take less sugar in their diet because they are suffering\nfrom diabetes? As a treatment, they might be taking injections of insulin.\nThis is a hormone which is produced by the pancreas and helps in\nregulating blood sugar levels.

    "full_text": "\" CHAPTER /\n- How do Organisms\nReproduce?\n\nefore we discuss the mechanisms by which organisms reproduce,\n\nlet us ask a more basic question — why do organisms reproduce?\nAfter all, reproduction is not necessary to maintain the life of an individual\norganism, unlike the essential life processes such as nutrition,\nrespiration, or excretion. On the other hand, if an individual organism is\ngoing to create more individuals, a lot of its energy will be spent in the\nprocess. So why should an individual organism waste energy on a process\nit does not need to stay alive? It would be interesting to discuss the\npossible answers in the classroom!\n\nWhatever the answer to this question, it is obvious that we notice\norganisms because they reproduce. If there were to be only one, non-\nreproducing member of a particular kind, it is doubtful that we would\nhave noticed its existence. It is the large numbers of organisms belonging\nto a single species that bring them to our notice. How do we know that\ntwo different individual organisms belong to the same species? Usually,\nwe say this because they look similar to each other. Thus, reproducing\norganisms create new individuals that look very much like themselves.\n\n7.1 DO ORGANISMS CREATE EXACT COPIES OF\nTHEMSELVES?\n\nOrganisms look similar because their body designs are similar. If body\ndesigns are to be similar, the blueprints for these designs should be\nsimilar. Thus, reproduction at its most basic level will involve making\ncopies of the blueprints of body design. In Class IX, we learnt that the\nchromosomes in the nucleus of a cell contain information for inheritance\nof features from parents to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo\nNucleic Acid) molecules. The DNA in the cell nucleus is the information\nsource for making proteins. If the information is changed, different\nproteins will be made. Different proteins will eventually lead to altered\nbody designs.\n\nTherefore, a basic event in reproduction is the creation of a DNA\ncopy. Cells use chemical reactions to build copies of their DNA. This\ncreates two copies of the DNA in a reproducing cell, and they will need to\nbe separated from each other. However, keeping one copy of DNA in the\noriginal cell and simply pushing the other one out would not work,\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n1064CHO8\n\n\nbecause the copy pushed out would not have any organised cellular\nstructure for maintaining life processes. Therefore, DNA copying is\naccompanied by the creation of an additional cellular apparatus, and\nthen the DNA copies separate, each with its own cellular apparatus.\nEffectively, a cell divides to give rise to two cells.\n\nThese two cells are of course similar, but are they likely to be\nabsolutely identical? The answer to this question will depend on how\naccurately the copying reactions involved occur. No bio-chemical reaction\nis absolutely reliable. Therefore, it is only to be expected that the process\nof copying the DNA will have some variations each time. As a result, the\nDNA copies generated will be similar, but may not be identical to the\noriginal. Some of these variations might be so drastic that the new DNA\ncopy cannot work with the cellular apparatus it inherits. Such a newborn\ncell will simply die. On the other hand, there could still be many other\nvariations in the DNA copies that would not lead to such a drastic\noutcome. Thus, the surviving cells are similar to, but subtly different\nfrom each other. This inbuilt tendency for variation during reproduction\nis the basis for evolution, as we will discuss in the next chapter.\n\n7.1.1 The Importance of Variation\n\nPopulations of organisms fill well-defined places, or niches, in the\necosystem, using their ability to reproduce. The consistency of DNA\ncopying during reproduction is important for the maintenance of body\ndesign features that allow the organism to use that particular niche.\nReproduction is therefore linked to the stability of populations of species.\n\nHowever, niches can change because of reasons beyond the control\nof the organisms. Temperatures on earth can go up or down, water levels\ncan vary, or there could be meteorite hits, to think of a few examples. If\na population of reproducing organisms were suited to a particular niche\nand if the niche were drastically altered, the population could be wiped\nout. However, if some variations were to be present in a few individuals\nin these populations, there would be some chance for them to survive.\nThus, if there were a population of bacteria living in temperate waters,\nand if the water temperature were to be increased by global warming,\nmost of these bacteria would die, but the few variants resistant to heat\nwould survive and grow further. Variation is thus useful for the survival\nof species over time.\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nWhat is the importance of DNA copying in reproduction?\n\nWhy is variation beneficial to the species but not necessarily\nfor the individual?\n\n114 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n7.2 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE\nORGANISMS\n\n= Dissolve about 10 gm of sugar in 100 mL of water.\n\n= Take 20 mL of this solution in a test tube and add a pinch of yeast\ngranules to it.\n\n= Put a cotton plug on the mouth of the test tube and keep it in a\nwarm place.\n\n= After 1 or 2 hours, put a small drop of yeast culture from the test\ntube on a slide and cover it with a coverslip.\n\n= Observe the slide under a microscope.\n\n= Wet a slice of bread, and keep it in a cool, moist and dark place.\n= Observe the surface of the slice with a magnifying glass.\n= Record your observations for a week.\n\nCompare and contrast the ways in which yeast grows in the first\ncase, and how mould grows in the second.\n\nHaving discussed the context in which reproductive processes work,\nlet us now examine how different organisms actually reproduce. The\nmodes by which various organisms reproduce depend on the body\ndesign of the organisms.\n\n7.2.1 Fission\n\nFor unicellular organisms, cell division, or fission, leads to the creation\nof new individuals. Many different patterns of fission have been observed.\nMany bacteria and protozoa simply split into two equal halves during\ncell division. In organisms such as Amoeba, the splitting of the two cells\nduring division can take place in any plane.\n\nActivity 7.3\n\n= Observe a permanent slide of\nAmoeba under a microscope.\n\n= Similarly observe another\npermanent slide of Amoeba\nshowing binary fission.\n\n= Now, compare the observations of\nboth the slides.\n\nHowever, some unicellular organisms\nshow somewhat more organisation of their\nbodies, such as is seen in Leishmania (which\ncause kala-azar), which have a whip-like\nstructure at one end of the cell. In such\norganisms, binary fission occurs in a definite orientation in relation to\n\nFigure 7.1(b) Binary fission in Leishmania\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 115\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nMultiple fission in\nPlasmodium\n\n116\n\nthese structures. Other single-celled organisms, such as the malarial\nparasite, Plasmodium, divide into many daughter cells simultaneously\nby multiple fission.\n\nYeast, on the other hand, can put out small buds that separate and\ngrow further, as we saw in Activity 7.1.\n\n7.2.2 Fragmentation\n\n= Collect water from a lake or pond that appears dark green and\ncontains filamentous structures.\n\nPut one or two filaments on a slide.\n\nPut a drop of glycerine on these filaments and cover it with a coverslip.\nObserve the slide under a microscope.\n\nCan you identify different tissues in the Spirogyra filaments?\n\nIn multi-cellular organisms with relatively simple body organisation,\nsimple reproductive methods can still work. Spirogyra, for example,\nsimply breaks up into smaller pieces upon maturation. These pieces or\nfragments grow into new individuals. Can we work out the reason for\nthis, based on what we saw in Activity 7.4?\n\nThis is not true for all multi-cellular organisms. They cannot simply\ndivide cell-by-cell. The reason is that many multi-cellular organisms, as\nwe have seen, are not simply a random collection of cells. Specialised\ncells are organised as tissues, and tissues are organised into organs,\nwhich then have to be placed at definite positions in the body. In sucha\ncarefully organised situation, cell-by-cell division would be impractical.\nMulti-cellular organisms, therefore, need to use more complex ways of\nreproduction.\n\nA basic strategy used in multi-cellular organisms is that different\ncell types perform different specialised functions. Following this general\npattern, reproduction in such organisms is also the function of a specific\ncell type. How is reproduction to be achieved from a single cell type, if\nthe organism itself consists of many cell types? The answer is that there\nmust be a single cell type in the organism that is capable of growing,\nproliferating and making other cell types under the right circumstances.\n\n7.2.3 Regeneration\n\nMany fully differentiated organisms have the ability to give rise to new\nindividual organisms from their body parts. That is, if the individual is\nsomehow cut or broken up into many pieces, many of these pieces grow\ninto separate individuals. For example, simple animals like Hydra and\nPlanaria can be cut into any number of pieces and each piece grows\ninto a complete organism. This is known as regeneration (see Fig. 7.3).\nRegeneration is carried out by specialised cells. These cells proliferate\nand make large numbers of cells. From this mass of cells, different cells\nundergo changes to become various cell types and tissues. These changes\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\ntake place in an organised\nsequence referred to as\ndevelopment. However,\nregeneration is not the same\nas reproduction, since most\norganisms would not\nnormally depend on being cut\nup to be able to reproduce.\n\n7.2.4 Budding\n\nOrganisms such as Hydra\nuse regenerative cells for\nreproduction in the process of\nbudding. In Hydra, a bud\nFigure 7.3 Regeneration in Planaria develops as an outgrowth due\nto repeated cell division at one\nspecific site (Fig. 7.4). These buds develop into tiny individuals and when\nfully mature, detach from the parent body and become new independent\nindividuals.\n\nFigure 7.4 Budding in Hydra\n\n7.2.5 Vegetative Propagation\n\nThere are many plants in which parts like the root, stem and leaves\ndevelop into new plants under appropriate conditions. Unlike in most\nanimals, plants can indeed use such a mode for reproduction. This\nproperty of vegetative propagation is used in methods such as layering\nor grafting to grow many plants like sugarcane, roses, or grapes for\nagricultural purposes. Plants raised by vegetative propagation can bear\nflowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds. Such methods\nalso make possible the propagation of plants such as banana, orange,\nrose and jasmine that have lost the capacity to produce seeds. Another\nadvantage of vegetative propagation is that all plants produced are\ngenetically similar enough to the parent plant to have all its\ncharacteristics.\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce?\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n117\n\n\n= Take a potato and observe its surface.

The thread-like structures that developed on\nthe bread in Activity 7.2 above are the hyphae of the bread mould\n(Rhizopus). They are not reproductive parts. On the other hand, the\ntiny blob-on-a-stick structures are involved in reproduction. The\nblobs are sporangia, which contain cells, or spores, that can\n\nfou eventually develop into new Rhizopus individuals (Fig. 7.6). The spores\nFigure 7.6 are covered by thick walls that protect them until they come into\n\ny,\nAf\n\nSpore formation in Rhizopus contact with another moist surface and can begin to grow.\n118 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nAll the modes of reproduction that we have discussed so far allow\nnew generations to be created from a single individual. This is known as\nasexual reproduction.\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nHow does binary fission differ from multiple fission?\nHow will an organism be benefited if it reproduces through spores?\n\nCan you think of reasons why more complex organisms cannot give\nrise to new individuals through regeneration?\n\nWhy is vegetative propagation practised for growing some types of\nplants?\n\nWhy is DNA copying an essential part of the process of reproduction?\n\n7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\n\nWe are also familiar with modes of reproduction that depend on the\ninvolvement of two individuals before a new generation can be created.\nBulls alone cannot produce new calves, nor can hens alone produce\nnew chicks. In such cases, both sexes, males and females, are needed to\nproduce new generations. What is the significance of this sexual mode\nof reproduction? Are there any limitations of the asexual mode of\nreproduction, which we have been discussing above?\n\n7.3.1 Why the Sexual Mode of Reproduction?\n\nThe creation of two new cells from one involves copying of the DNA as\nwell as of the cellular apparatus. The DNA copying mechanism, as we\nhave noted, cannot be absolutely accurate, and the resultant errors are\na source of variations in populations of organisms. Every individual\norganism cannot be protected by variations, but in a population,\nvariations are useful for ensuring the survival of the species. It would\ntherefore make sense if organisms came up with reproductive modes\nthat allowed more and more variation to be generated.\n\nWhile DNA-copying mechanisms are not absolutely accurate, they\nare precise enough to make the generation of variation a fairly slow\nprocess. If the DNA copying mechanisms were to be less accurate, many\nof the resultant DNA copies would not be able to work with the cellular\napparatus, and would die. So how can the process of making variants\nbe speeded up? Each new variation is made ina DNA copy that already\nhas variations accumulated from previous generations. Thus, two\ndifferent individuals in a population would have quite different patterns\nof accumulated variations. Since all of these variations are in living\nindividuals, it is assured that they do not have any really bad effects.\nCombining variations from two or more individuals would thus create\nnew combinations of variants. Each combination would be novel, since\nit would involve two different individuals. The sexual mode of\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 119\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nPistil\n\nFigure 7.7\nLongitudinal section of\n\nflower\n\n120\n\nreproduction incorporates such a process of combining DNA from two\ndifferent individuals during reproduction.\n\nBut this creates a major difficulty. If each new generation is to be the\ncombination of the DNA copies from two pre-existing individuals, then\neach new generation will end up having twice the amount of DNA that\nthe previous generation had. This is likely to mess up the control of the\ncellular apparatus by the DNA. How many ways can we think of for\nsolving this difficulty?\n\nWe have seen earlier that as organisms become more complex, the\nspecialisation of tissue increases. One solution that many multi-cellular\norganisms have found for the problem mentioned above is to have special\nlineages of cells in specialised organs in which only half the number of\nchromosomes and half the amount of DNA as compared to the non-\nreproductive body cells. This is achieved by a process of cell division\ncalled meiosis. Thus, when these germ-cells from two individuals combine\nduring sexual reproduction to form a new individual, it results in re-\nestablishment of the number of chromosomes and the DNA content in\nthe new generation.\n\nIf the zygote is to grow and develop into an organism which has\nhighly specialised tissues and organs, then it has to have sufficient stores\nof energy for doing this. In very simple organisms, it is seen that the two\ngerm-cells are not very different from one another, or may even be similar.\nBut as the body designs become more complex, the germ-cells also\nspecialise. One germ-cell is large and contains the food-stores while the\nother is smaller and likely to be motile. Conventionally, the motile germ-\ncell is called the male gamete and the germ-cell containing the stored\nfood is called the female gamete. We shall see in the next few sections\nhow the need to create these two different types of gametes give rise to\ndifferences in the male and female reproductive organs and, in some\ncases, differences in the bodies of the male and female organisms.\n\n7.3.2 Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants\n\nThe reproductive parts of angiosperms are located in the flower. You\nhave already studied the different parts of a flower - sepals, petals,\nstamens and pistil. Stamens and pistil are\nthe reproductive parts of a flower which\nanther) g Contain the germ-cells. What possible\n\n| = functions could the petals and sepals serve?\n\nJo The flower may be unisexual (papaya,\nwatermelon) when it contains either stamens\nor pistil or bisexual (Hibiscus, mustard)\nwhen it contains both stamens and pistil.\nStamen is the male reproductive part and it\nproduces pollen grains that are yellowish\nin colour. You must have seen this yellowish\npowder that often sticks to our hands if we\ntouch the stamen ofa flower. Pistil is present\nin the centre of a flower and is the female\nreproductive part. It is made of three parts.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nThe swollen bottom part is the ovary, middle elongated part is the style\nand the terminal part which may be sticky is the stigma. The ovary\ncontains ovules and each ovule has an egg cell. The male germ-cell\nproduced by pollen grain fuses with the female gamete present in\nthe ovule. This fusion of the germ-cells or fertilisation gives us the\nzygote which is capable of growing into a new plant.\n\nThus the pollen needs to be transferred from the stamen to the\nstigma. If this transfer of pollen occurs in the same flower, it is\nreferred to as self-pollination. On the other hand, if the pollen is\ntransferred from one flower to another, it is known as cross-\npollination. This transfer of pollen from one flower to another is\nachieved by agents like wind, water or animals.\n\nAfter the pollen lands on a suitable stigma, it has to reach the\nfemale germ-cells which are in the ovary. For this, a tube grows\nout of the pollen grain and travels through the style to reach the\novary.\n\nAfter fertilisation, the zygote divides several times to form an\nembryo within the ovule. The ovule develops a tough coat and is\ngradually converted into a seed. The ovary grows rapidly and ripens\nto form a fruit. Meanwhile, the petals, sepals, stamens, style and\nstigma may shrivel and fall off. Have you ever observed any flower\npart still persisting in the fruit? Try and work out the advantages Figure 7.8\nof seed-formation for the plant. The seed contains the future plant Germination of paller on\nor embryo which develops into a seedling under appropriate icc\nconditions. This process is known as germination.\n\nEan ee a vend Plumule\n(future shoot)\n= Soak a few seeds of Bengal gram (chana) Cotyledon ;\nand keep them overnight.

Let us now look at the species that we are most\ninterested in, namely, humans. Humans use a sexual mode of\nreproduction. How does this process work?\n\nLet us begin at an apparently unrelated point. All of us know that\nour bodies change as we become older. You have learnt changes that\ntake place in your body earlier in Class VIII also. We notice that our\nheight has increased continuously from early age till now. We acquire\nteeth, we even lose the old, so-called milk teeth and acquire new ones.\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 121\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n122\n\nAll of these are changes that can be grouped under the general process\nof growth, in which the body becomes larger. But in early teenage years,\na whole new set of changes occurs that cannot be explained simply as\nbody enlargement. Instead, the appearance of the body changes.\nProportions change, new features appear, and so do new sensations.\n\nSome of these changes are common to both boys and girls. We begin\nto notice thick hair growing in new parts of the body such as armpits\nand the genital area between the thighs, which can also become darker\nin colour. Thinner hair can also appear on legs and arms, as well as on\nthe face. The skin frequently becomes oily and we might begin to develop\npimples. We begin to be conscious and aware of both our own bodies\nand those of others in new ways.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also changes taking place that are\ndifferent between boys and girls. In girls, breast size begins to increase,\nwith darkening of the skin of the nipples at the tips of the breasts. Also,\ngirls begin to menstruate at around this time. Boys begin to have new\nthick hair growth on the face and their voices begin to crack. Further,\nthe penis occasionally begins to become enlarged and erect, either in\ndaydreams or at night.\n\nAll of these changes take place slowly, over a period of months and\nyears. They do not happen all at the same time in one person, nor do\nthey happen at an exact age. In some people, they happen early and\nquickly, while in others, they can happen slowly. Also, each change does\nnot become complete quickly either. So, for example, thick hair on the\nface in boys appears as a few scattered hairs first, and only slowly does\nthe growth begin to become uniform. Even so, all these changes show\ndifferences between people. Just as we have differently shaped noses or\nfingers, so also we have different patterns of hair growth, or size and\nshape of breast or penis. All of these changes are aspects of the sexual\nmaturation of the body.\n\nWhy does the body show sexual maturation at this age? We have\ntalked about the need for specialised cell types in multi-cellular bodies\nto carry out specialised functions. The creation of germ-cells to participate\nin sexual reproduction is another specialised function, and we have seen\nthat plants develop special cell and tissue types to create them. Human\nbeings also develop special tissues for this purpose. However, while the\nbody of the individual organism is growing to its adult size, the resources\nof the body are mainly directed at achieving this growth. While that is\nhappening, the maturation of the reproductive tissue is not likely to be\na major priority. Thus, as the rate of general body growth begins to slow\ndown, reproductive tissues begin to mature. This period during\nadolescence is called puberty.\n\nSo how do all the changes that we have talked about link to the\nreproductive process? We must remember that the sexual mode of\nreproduction means that germ-cells from two individuals have to join\ntogether. This can happen by the external release of germ-cells from the\nbodies of individuals, as happens in flowering plants. Or it can happen\nby two individuals joining their bodies together for internal transfer of\ngerm-cells for fusion, as happens in many animals. If animals are to\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nparticipate in this process of mating, their state of sexual maturity must\nbe identifiable by other individuals. Many changes during puberty, such\nas new hair-growth patterns, are signals that sexual maturation is taking\n\nplace.\n\nOn the other hand, the actual transfer of germ-cells between two\npeople needs special organs for the sexual act, such as the penis when it\nis capable of becoming erect. In mammals such as humans, the baby is\ncarried in the mother’s body for a long period, and will be breast-fed\nlater. The female reproductive organs and breasts will need to mature to\naccommodate these possibilities. Let us look at the systems involved in\n\nthe process of sexual reproduction.\n\n7.3.3 (a) Male Reproductive System\n\nThe male reproductive system (Fig. 7.10)\nconsists of portions which produce the\ngerm-cells and other portions that deliver\nthe germ-cells to the site of fertilisation.\n\nThe formation of germ-cells or sperms\ntakes place in the testes. These are located\noutside the abdominal cavity in scrotum\nbecause sperm formation requires a lower\ntemperature than the normal body\ntemperature. We have discussed the role of the\ntestes in the secretion of the hormone,\ntestosterone, in the previous chapter. In\naddition to regulating the formation of sperms,\ntestosterone brings about changes in\nappearance seen in boys at the time of puberty.\n\nThe sperms formed are delivered\nthrough the vas deferens which unites with\na tube coming from the urinary bladder. The\nurethra thus forms a common passage for\nboth the sperms and urine. Along the path\nof the vas deferens, glands like the prostate\nand the seminal vesicles add their secretions\nso that the sperms are now in a fluid which\nmakes their transport easier and this fluid\nalso provides nutrition. The sperms are tiny\nbodies that consist of mainly genetic\nmaterial and a long tail that helps them to\nmove towards the female germ-cell.\n\n7.3.3 (6) Female Reproductive System\n\nThe female germ-cells or eggs are made in\nthe ovaries. They are also responsible for the\nproduction of some hormones. Look at\nFig. 7.11 and identify the various organs in\nthe female reproductive system.\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce?\n\nUreter\n\nSeminal vesicle\n\nVas\ndeferens\n\nScrotum\n\nFigure 7.10 Human-—male reproductive system\n\nOviduct or\nFallopian\ntube\n\nOvary\n\nFigure 7.11 Human-—female reproductive system\n\n123\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n124\n\nWhen a girl is born, the ovaries already contain thousands of\nimmature eggs. On reaching puberty, some of these start maturing. One\negg is produced every month by one of the ovaries. The egg is carried\nfrom the ovary to the womb through a thin oviduct or fallopian tube.\nThe two oviducts unite into an elastic bag-like structure known as the\nuterus. The uterus opens into the vagina through the cervix.\n\nThe sperms enter through the vaginal passage during sexual\nintercourse. They travel upwards and reach the oviduct where they may\nencounter the egg. The fertilised egg (zygote) starts dividing and form a\nball of cells or embryo. The embryo is implanted in the lining of the uterus\nwhere they continue to grow and develop organs to become foetus. We\nhave seen in earlier sections that the mother’s body is designed to\nundertake the development of the child. Hence the uterus prepares itself\nevery month to receive and nurture the growing embryo. The lining\nthickens and is richly supplied with blood to nourish the growing embryo.\n\nThe embryo gets nutrition from the mother’s blood with the help of a\nspecial tissue called placenta. This is a disc which is embedded in the\nuterine wall. It contains villi on the embryo’s side of the tissue. On the\nmother’s side are blood spaces, which surround the villi. This provides\na large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to\nthe embryo. The developing embryo will also generate waste substances\nwhich can be removed by transferring them into the mother’s blood\nthrough the placenta. The development of the child inside the mother’s\nbody takes approximately nine months. The child is born as a result of\nrhythmic contractions of the muscles in the uterus.\n\n7.3.3 (c) What happens when the Egg is not Fertilised?\n\nIf the egg is not fertilised, it lives for about one day. Since the ovary\nreleases one egg every month, the uterus also prepares itself every month\nto receive a fertilised egg. Thus its lining becomes thick and spongy.\nThis would be required for nourishing the embryo if fertilisation had\ntaken place. Now, however, this lining is not needed any longer. So, the\nlining slowly breaks and comes out through the vagina as blood and\nmucous. This cycle takes place roughly every month and is known as\nmenstruation. It usually lasts for about two to eight days.\n\n7.3.3. (d) Reproductive Health\n\nAs we have seen, the process of sexual maturation is gradual, and takes\nplace while general body growth is still going on. Therefore, some degree\nof sexual maturation does not necessarily mean that the body or the\nmind is ready for sexual acts or for having and bringing up children.\nHow do we decide if the body or the mind is ready for this major\nresponsibility? All of us are under many different kinds of pressures\nabout these issues. There can be pressure from our friends for\nparticipating in many activities, whether we really want to or not. There\ncan be pressure from families to get married and start having children.\nThere can be pressure from government agencies to avoid having\nchildren. In this situation, making choices can become very difficult.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nWe must also consider the possible health consequences of having\nsex. We have discussed in Class IX that diseases can be transmitted\nfrom person to person in a variety of ways. Since the sexual act is a\nvery intimate connection of bodies, it is not surprising that many\ndiseases can be sexually transmitted. These include bacterial infections\nsuch as gonorrhoea and syphilis, and viral infections such as warts\nand HIV-AIDS. Is it possible to prevent the transmission of such diseases\nduring the sexual act? Using a covering, called a condom, for the penis\nduring sex helps to prevent transmission of many of these infections to\nsome extent.\n\nThe sexual act always has the potential to lead to pregnancy.\nPregnancy will make major demands on the body and the mind of the\nwoman, and if she is not ready for it, her health will be adversely\naffected. Therefore, many ways have been devised to avoid pregnancy.\nThese contraceptive methods fall in a number of categories. One\ncategory is the creation of a mechanical barrier so that sperm does not\nreach the egg. Condoms on the penis or similar coverings worn in the\nvagina can serve this purpose. Another category of contraceptives acts\nby changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not\nreleased and fertilisation cannot occur. These drugs commonly need\nto be taken orally as pills. However, since they change hormonal\nbalances, they can cause side-effects too. Other contraceptive devices\nsuch as the loop or the copper-T are placed in the uterus to prevent\npregnancy. Again, they can cause side effects due to irritation of the\nuterus. If the vas deferens in the male is blocked, sperm transfer will\nbe prevented. If the fallopian tube in the female is blocked, the egg will\nnot be able to reach the uterus. In both cases fertilisation will not take\nplace. Surgical methods can be used to create such blocks. While\nsurgical methods are safe in the long run, surgery itself can cause\ninfections and other problems if not performed properly. Surgery can\nalso be used for removal of unwanted pregnancies. These may be\nmisused by people who do not want a particular child, as happens in\nillegal sex-selective abortion of female foetuses. For a healthy society,\nthe female-male sex ratio must be maintained. Because of reckless\nfemale foeticides, child sex ratio is declining at an alarming rate in\nsome sections of our society, although prenatal sex determination has\nbeen prohibited by law.\n\nWe have noted earlier that reproduction is the process by which\norganisms increase their populations. The rates of birth and death ina\ngiven population will determine its size. The size of the human population\nis a cause for concern for many people. This is because an expanding\npopulation makes it harder to improve everybody’s standard of living.\nHowever, if inequality in society is the main reason for poor standards of\nliving for many people, the size of the population is relatively unimportant.\nIf we look around us, what can we identify as the most important\nreason(s) for poor living standards?\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce?\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n125\n\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nHow is the process of pollination different from fertilisation?\nWhat is the role of the seminal vesicles and the prostate gland?\nWhat are the changes seen in girls at the time of puberty?\n\nHow does the embryo get nourishment inside the mother’s body?\n\nIf a woman is using a copper-T, will it help in protecting her from\nsexually transmitted diseases?\n\nWhat you have learnt\n\nReproduction, unlike other life processes, is not essential to maintain the life of an\nindividual organism.\n\nReproduction involves creation of a DNA copy and additional cellular apparatus\nby the cell involved in the process.\n\nVarious organisms use different modes of reproduction depending on their body\ndesign.\n\nIn fission, many bacteria and protozoa simply divide into two or more daughter\ncells.\n\nOrganisms such as hydra can regenerate if they are broken into pieces. They can\nalso give out buds which mature into new individuals.\n\nRoots, stems and leaves of some plants develop into new plants through vegetative\npropagation.\n\nThese are examples of asexual reproduction where new generations are created\nfrom a single individual.\n\nSexual reproduction involves two individuals for the creation of a new individual.\nDNA copying mechanisms creates variations which are useful for ensuring the\nsurvival of the species. Modes of sexual reproduction allow for greater variation to\nbe generated.\n\nReproduction in flowering plants involves transfer of pollen grains from the anther\nto the stigma which is referred to as pollination. This is followed by fertilisation.\nChanges in the body at puberty, such as increase in breast size in girls and new\nfacial hair growth in boys, are signs of sexual maturation.\n\nThe male reproductive system in human beings consists of testes which produce\nsperms, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, urethra and penis.\n\nThe female reproductive system in human beings consists of ovaries, fallopian\ntubes, uterus and vagina.\n\nSexual reproduction in human beings involves the introduction of sperm in the\nvagina of the female. Fertilisation occurs in the fallopian tube.\n\nContraception to avoid pregnancy can be achieved by the use of condoms, oral\npills, copper-T and other methods.\n\n126 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n.

        "text": "\" CHAPTER /\n- How do Organisms\nReproduce?\n\nefore we discuss the mechanisms by which organisms reproduce,\n\nlet us ask a more basic question — why do organisms reproduce?\nAfter all, reproduction is not necessary to maintain the life of an individual\norganism, unlike the essential life processes such as nutrition,\nrespiration, or excretion. On the other hand, if an individual organism is\ngoing to create more individuals, a lot of its energy will be spent in the\nprocess. So why should an individual organism waste energy on a process\nit does not need to stay alive? It would be interesting to discuss the\npossible answers in the classroom!\n\nWhatever the answer to this question, it is obvious that we notice\norganisms because they reproduce. If there were to be only one, non-\nreproducing member of a particular kind, it is doubtful that we would\nhave noticed its existence. It is the large numbers of organisms belonging\nto a single species that bring them to our notice. How do we know that\ntwo different individual organisms belong to the same species? Usually,\nwe say this because they look similar to each other. Thus, reproducing\norganisms create new individuals that look very much like themselves.\n\n7.1 DO ORGANISMS CREATE EXACT COPIES OF\nTHEMSELVES?\n\nOrganisms look similar because their body designs are similar. If body\ndesigns are to be similar, the blueprints for these designs should be\nsimilar. Thus, reproduction at its most basic level will involve making\ncopies of the blueprints of body design. In Class IX, we learnt that the\nchromosomes in the nucleus of a cell contain information for inheritance\nof features from parents to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo\nNucleic Acid) molecules. The DNA in the cell nucleus is the information\nsource for making proteins. If the information is changed, different\nproteins will be made. Different proteins will eventually lead to altered\nbody designs.\n\nTherefore, a basic event in reproduction is the creation of a DNA\ncopy. Cells use chemical reactions to build copies of their DNA. This\ncreates two copies of the DNA in a reproducing cell, and they will need to\nbe separated from each other. However, keeping one copy of DNA in the\noriginal cell and simply pushing the other one out would not work,\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n1064CHO8\n",

        "text": "because the copy pushed out would not have any organised cellular\nstructure for maintaining life processes. Therefore, DNA copying is\naccompanied by the creation of an additional cellular apparatus, and\nthen the DNA copies separate, each with its own cellular apparatus.\nEffectively, a cell divides to give rise to two cells.\n\nThese two cells are of course similar, but are they likely to be\nabsolutely identical? The answer to this question will depend on how\naccurately the copying reactions involved occur. No bio-chemical reaction\nis absolutely reliable. Therefore, it is only to be expected that the process\nof copying the DNA will have some variations each time. As a result, the\nDNA copies generated will be similar, but may not be identical to the\noriginal. Some of these variations might be so drastic that the new DNA\ncopy cannot work with the cellular apparatus it inherits. Such a newborn\ncell will simply die. On the other hand, there could still be many other\nvariations in the DNA copies that would not lead to such a drastic\noutcome. Thus, the surviving cells are similar to, but subtly different\nfrom each other. This inbuilt tendency for variation during reproduction\nis the basis for evolution, as we will discuss in the next chapter.\n\n7.1.1 The Importance of Variation\n\nPopulations of organisms fill well-defined places, or niches, in the\necosystem, using their ability to reproduce. The consistency of DNA\ncopying during reproduction is important for the maintenance of body\ndesign features that allow the organism to use that particular niche.\nReproduction is therefore linked to the stability of populations of species.\n\nHowever, niches can change because of reasons beyond the control\nof the organisms. Temperatures on earth can go up or down, water levels\ncan vary, or there could be meteorite hits, to think of a few examples. If\na population of reproducing organisms were suited to a particular niche\nand if the niche were drastically altered, the population could be wiped\nout. However, if some variations were to be present in a few individuals\nin these populations, there would be some chance for them to survive.\nThus, if there were a population of bacteria living in temperate waters,\nand if the water temperature were to be increased by global warming,\nmost of these bacteria would die, but the few variants resistant to heat\nwould survive and grow further. Variation is thus useful for the survival\nof species over time.\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nWhat is the importance of DNA copying in reproduction?\n\nWhy is variation beneficial to the species but not necessarily\nfor the individual?\n\n114 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

Many different patterns of fission have been observed.\nMany bacteria and protozoa simply split into two equal halves during\ncell division.

Spirogyra, for example,\nsimply breaks up into smaller pieces upon maturation. These pieces or\nfragments grow into new individuals. Can we work out the reason for\nthis, based on what we saw in Activity 7.4?\n\nThis is not true for all multi-cellular organisms. They cannot simply\ndivide cell-by-cell. The reason is that many multi-cellular organisms, as\nwe have seen, are not simply a random collection of cells. Specialised\ncells are organised as tissues, and tissues are organised into organs,\nwhich then have to be placed at definite positions in the body. In sucha\ncarefully organised situation, cell-by-cell division would be impractical.\nMulti-cellular organisms, therefore, need to use more complex ways of\nreproduction.\n\nA basic strategy used in multi-cellular organisms is that different\ncell types perform different specialised functions. Following this general\npattern, reproduction in such organisms is also the function of a specific\ncell type. How is reproduction to be achieved from a single cell type, if\nthe organism itself consists of many cell types? The answer is that there\nmust be a single cell type in the organism that is capable of growing,\nproliferating and making other cell types under the right circumstances.\n\n7.2.3 Regeneration\n\nMany fully differentiated organisms have the ability to give rise to new\nindividual organisms from their body parts. That is, if the individual is\nsomehow cut or broken up into many pieces, many of these pieces grow\ninto separate individuals. For example, simple animals like Hydra and\nPlanaria can be cut into any number of pieces and each piece grows\ninto a complete organism. This is known as regeneration (see Fig. 7.3).\nRegeneration is carried out by specialised cells. These cells proliferate\nand make large numbers of cells. From this mass of cells, different cells\nundergo changes to become various cell types and tissues. These changes\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

In such cases, both sexes, males and females, are needed to\nproduce new generations. What is the significance of this sexual mode\nof reproduction? Are there any limitations of the asexual mode of\nreproduction, which we have been discussing above?\n\n7.3.1 Why the Sexual Mode of Reproduction?\n\nThe creation of two new cells from one involves copying of the DNA as\nwell as of the cellular apparatus. The DNA copying mechanism, as we\nhave noted, cannot be absolutely accurate, and the resultant errors are\na source of variations in populations of organisms. Every individual\norganism cannot be protected by variations, but in a population,\nvariations are useful for ensuring the survival of the species. It would\ntherefore make sense if organisms came up with reproductive modes\nthat allowed more and more variation to be generated.\n\nWhile DNA-copying mechanisms are not absolutely accurate, they\nare precise enough to make the generation of variation a fairly slow\nprocess. If the DNA copying mechanisms were to be less accurate, many\nof the resultant DNA copies would not be able to work with the cellular\napparatus, and would die. So how can the process of making variants\nbe speeded up? Each new variation is made ina DNA copy that already\nhas variations accumulated from previous generations. Thus, two\ndifferent individuals in a population would have quite different patterns\nof accumulated variations. Since all of these variations are in living\nindividuals, it is assured that they do not have any really bad effects.\nCombining variations from two or more individuals would thus create\nnew combinations of variants.

If each new generation is to be the\ncombination of the DNA copies from two pre-existing individuals, then\neach new generation will end up having twice the amount of DNA that\nthe previous generation had. This is likely to mess up the control of the\ncellular apparatus by the DNA. How many ways can we think of for\nsolving this difficulty?\n\nWe have seen earlier that as organisms become more complex, the\nspecialisation of tissue increases. One solution that many multi-cellular\norganisms have found for the problem mentioned above is to have special\nlineages of cells in specialised organs in which only half the number of\nchromosomes and half the amount of DNA as compared to the non-\nreproductive body cells. This is achieved by a process of cell division\ncalled meiosis. Thus, when these germ-cells from two individuals combine\nduring sexual reproduction to form a new individual, it results in re-\nestablishment of the number of chromosomes and the DNA content in\nthe new generation.\n\nIf the zygote is to grow and develop into an organism which has\nhighly specialised tissues and organs, then it has to have sufficient stores\nof energy for doing this. In very simple organisms, it is seen that the two\ngerm-cells are not very different from one another, or may even be similar.\nBut as the body designs become more complex, the germ-cells also\nspecialise. One germ-cell is large and contains the food-stores while the\nother is smaller and likely to be motile. Conventionally, the motile germ-\ncell is called the male gamete and the germ-cell containing the stored\nfood is called the female gamete. We shall see in the next few sections\nhow the need to create these two different types of gametes give rise to\ndifferences in the male and female reproductive organs and, in some\ncases, differences in the bodies of the male and female organisms.\n\n7.3.2 Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants\n\nThe reproductive parts of angiosperms are located in the flower.

The ovary\ncontains ovules and each ovule has an egg cell. The male germ-cell\nproduced by pollen grain fuses with the female gamete present in\nthe ovule. This fusion of the germ-cells or fertilisation gives us the\nzygote which is capable of growing into a new plant.\n\nThus the pollen needs to be transferred from the stamen to the\nstigma. If this transfer of pollen occurs in the same flower, it is\nreferred to as self-pollination. On the other hand, if the pollen is\ntransferred from one flower to another, it is known as cross-\npollination. This transfer of pollen from one flower to another is\nachieved by agents like wind, water or animals.\n\nAfter the pollen lands on a suitable stigma, it has to reach the\nfemale germ-cells which are in the ovary.

Let us now look at the species that we are most\ninterested in, namely, humans. Humans use a sexual mode of\nreproduction. How does this process work?\n\nLet us begin at an apparently unrelated point. All of us know that\nour bodies change as we become older. You have learnt changes that\ntake place in your body earlier in Class VIII also. We notice that our\nheight has increased continuously from early age till now. We acquire\nteeth, we even lose the old, so-called milk teeth and acquire new ones.\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 121\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

But in early teenage years,\na whole new set of changes occurs that cannot be explained simply as\nbody enlargement. Instead, the appearance of the body changes.\nProportions change, new features appear, and so do new sensations.\n\nSome of these changes are common to both boys and girls. We begin\nto notice thick hair growing in new parts of the body such as armpits\nand the genital area between the thighs, which can also become darker\nin colour. Thinner hair can also appear on legs and arms, as well as on\nthe face. The skin frequently becomes oily and we might begin to develop\npimples. We begin to be conscious and aware of both our own bodies\nand those of others in new ways.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also changes taking place that are\ndifferent between boys and girls. In girls, breast size begins to increase,\nwith darkening of the skin of the nipples at the tips of the breasts. Also,\ngirls begin to menstruate at around this time. Boys begin to have new\nthick hair growth on the face and their voices begin to crack. Further,\nthe penis occasionally begins to become enlarged and erect, either in\ndaydreams or at night.\n\nAll of these changes take place slowly, over a period of months and\nyears. They do not happen all at the same time in one person, nor do\nthey happen at an exact age. In some people, they happen early and\nquickly, while in others, they can happen slowly. Also, each change does\nnot become complete quickly either. So, for example, thick hair on the\nface in boys appears as a few scattered hairs first, and only slowly does\nthe growth begin to become uniform. Even so, all these changes show\ndifferences between people. Just as we have differently shaped noses or\nfingers, so also we have different patterns of hair growth, or size and\nshape of breast or penis. All of these changes are aspects of the sexual\nmaturation of the body.\n\nWhy does the body show sexual maturation at this age? We have\ntalked about the need for specialised cell types in multi-cellular bodies\nto carry out specialised functions. The creation of germ-cells to participate\nin sexual reproduction is another specialised function, and we have seen\nthat plants develop special cell and tissue types to create them. Human\nbeings also develop special tissues for this purpose. However, while the\nbody of the individual organism is growing to its adult size, the resources\nof the body are mainly directed at achieving this growth. While that is\nhappening, the maturation of the reproductive tissue is not likely to be\na major priority. Thus, as the rate of general body growth begins to slow\ndown, reproductive tissues begin to mature. This period during\nadolescence is called puberty.\n\nSo how do all the changes that we have talked about link to the\nreproductive process? We must remember that the sexual mode of\nreproduction means that germ-cells from two individuals have to join\ntogether. This can happen by the external release of germ-cells from the\nbodies of individuals, as happens in flowering plants. Or it can happen\nby two individuals joining their bodies together for internal transfer of\ngerm-cells for fusion, as happens in many animals. If animals are to\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

        "text": "participate in this process of mating, their state of sexual maturity must\nbe identifiable by other individuals. Many changes during puberty, such\nas new hair-growth patterns, are signals that sexual maturation is taking\n\nplace.\n\nOn the other hand, the actual transfer of germ-cells between two\npeople needs special organs for the sexual act, such as the penis when it\nis capable of becoming erect. In mammals such as humans, the baby is\ncarried in the mother’s body for a long period, and will be breast-fed\nlater. The female reproductive organs and breasts will need to mature to\naccommodate these possibilities. Let us look at the systems involved in\n\nthe process of sexual reproduction.\n\n7.3.3 (a) Male Reproductive System\n\nThe male reproductive system (Fig. 7.10)\nconsists of portions which produce the\ngerm-cells and other portions that deliver\nthe germ-cells to the site of fertilisation.\n\nThe formation of germ-cells or sperms\ntakes place in the testes. These are located\noutside the abdominal cavity in scrotum\nbecause sperm formation requires a lower\ntemperature than the normal body\ntemperature. We have discussed the role of the\ntestes in the secretion of the hormone,\ntestosterone, in the previous chapter. In\naddition to regulating the formation of sperms,\ntestosterone brings about changes in\nappearance seen in boys at the time of puberty.\n\nThe sperms formed are delivered\nthrough the vas deferens which unites with\na tube coming from the urinary bladder. The\nurethra thus forms a common passage for\nboth the sperms and urine. Along the path\nof the vas deferens, glands like the prostate\nand the seminal vesicles add their secretions\nso that the sperms are now in a fluid which\nmakes their transport easier and this fluid\nalso provides nutrition. The sperms are tiny\nbodies that consist of mainly genetic\nmaterial and a long tail that helps them to\nmove towards the female germ-cell.\n\n7.3.3 (6) Female Reproductive System\n\nThe female germ-cells or eggs are made in\nthe ovaries. They are also responsible for the\nproduction of some hormones. Look at\nFig. 7.11 and identify the various organs in\nthe female reproductive system.\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce?\n\nUreter\n\nSeminal vesicle\n\nVas\ndeferens\n\nScrotum\n\nFigure 7.10 Human-—male reproductive system\n\nOviduct or\nFallopian\ntube\n\nOvary\n\nFigure 7.11 Human-—female reproductive system\n\n123\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

One\negg is produced every month by one of the ovaries. The egg is carried\nfrom the ovary to the womb through a thin oviduct or fallopian tube.\nThe two oviducts unite into an elastic bag-like structure known as the\nuterus. The uterus opens into the vagina through the cervix.\n\nThe sperms enter through the vaginal passage during sexual\nintercourse. They travel upwards and reach the oviduct where they may\nencounter the egg. The fertilised egg (zygote) starts dividing and form a\nball of cells or embryo. The embryo is implanted in the lining of the uterus\nwhere they continue to grow and develop organs to become foetus. We\nhave seen in earlier sections that the mother’s body is designed to\nundertake the development of the child. Hence the uterus prepares itself\nevery month to receive and nurture the growing embryo. The lining\nthickens and is richly supplied with blood to nourish the growing embryo.\n\nThe embryo gets nutrition from the mother’s blood with the help of a\nspecial tissue called placenta. This is a disc which is embedded in the\nuterine wall. It contains villi on the embryo’s side of the tissue. On the\nmother’s side are blood spaces, which surround the villi. This provides\na large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to\nthe embryo. The developing embryo will also generate waste substances\nwhich can be removed by transferring them into the mother’s blood\nthrough the placenta. The development of the child inside the mother’s\nbody takes approximately nine months. The child is born as a result of\nrhythmic contractions of the muscles in the uterus.\n\n7.3.3 (c) What happens when the Egg is not Fertilised?\n\nIf the egg is not fertilised, it lives for about one day. Since the ovary\nreleases one egg every month, the uterus also prepares itself every month\nto receive a fertilised egg. Thus its lining becomes thick and spongy.\nThis would be required for nourishing the embryo if fertilisation had\ntaken place. Now, however, this lining is not needed any longer. So, the\nlining slowly breaks and comes out through the vagina as blood and\nmucous. This cycle takes place roughly every month and is known as\nmenstruation. It usually lasts for about two to eight days.\n\n7.3.3. (d) Reproductive Health\n\nAs we have seen, the process of sexual maturation is gradual, and takes\nplace while general body growth is still going on. Therefore, some degree\nof sexual maturation does not necessarily mean that the body or the\nmind is ready for sexual acts or for having and bringing up children.\nHow do we decide if the body or the mind is ready for this major\nresponsibility? All of us are under many different kinds of pressures\nabout these issues. There can be pressure from our friends for\nparticipating in many activities, whether we really want to or not. There\ncan be pressure from families to get married and start having children.\nThere can be pressure from government agencies to avoid having\nchildren. In this situation, making choices can become very difficult.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

        "text": "We must also consider the possible health consequences of having\nsex. We have discussed in Class IX that diseases can be transmitted\nfrom person to person in a variety of ways. Since the sexual act is a\nvery intimate connection of bodies, it is not surprising that many\ndiseases can be sexually transmitted. These include bacterial infections\nsuch as gonorrhoea and syphilis, and viral infections such as warts\nand HIV-AIDS. Is it possible to prevent the transmission of such diseases\nduring the sexual act? Using a covering, called a condom, for the penis\nduring sex helps to prevent transmission of many of these infections to\nsome extent.\n\nThe sexual act always has the potential to lead to pregnancy.\nPregnancy will make major demands on the body and the mind of the\nwoman, and if she is not ready for it, her health will be adversely\naffected. Therefore, many ways have been devised to avoid pregnancy.\nThese contraceptive methods fall in a number of categories. One\ncategory is the creation of a mechanical barrier so that sperm does not\nreach the egg. Condoms on the penis or similar coverings worn in the\nvagina can serve this purpose. Another category of contraceptives acts\nby changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not\nreleased and fertilisation cannot occur. These drugs commonly need\nto be taken orally as pills. However, since they change hormonal\nbalances, they can cause side-effects too. Other contraceptive devices\nsuch as the loop or the copper-T are placed in the uterus to prevent\npregnancy. Again, they can cause side effects due to irritation of the\nuterus. If the vas deferens in the male is blocked, sperm transfer will\nbe prevented. If the fallopian tube in the female is blocked, the egg will\nnot be able to reach the uterus. In both cases fertilisation will not take\nplace. Surgical methods can be used to create such blocks. While\nsurgical methods are safe in the long run, surgery itself can cause\ninfections and other problems if not performed properly. Surgery can\nalso be used for removal of unwanted pregnancies. These may be\nmisused by people who do not want a particular child, as happens in\nillegal sex-selective abortion of female foetuses. For a healthy society,\nthe female-male sex ratio must be maintained. Because of reckless\nfemale foeticides, child sex ratio is declining at an alarming rate in\nsome sections of our society, although prenatal sex determination has\nbeen prohibited by law.\n\nWe have noted earlier that reproduction is the process by which\norganisms increase their populations. The rates of birth and death ina\ngiven population will determine its size. The size of the human population\nis a cause for concern for many people. This is because an expanding\npopulation makes it harder to improve everybody’s standard of living.\nHowever, if inequality in society is the main reason for poor standards of\nliving for many people, the size of the population is relatively unimportant.\nIf we look around us, what can we identify as the most important\nreason(s) for poor living standards?\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce?\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n125\n",

Modes of sexual reproduction allow for greater variation to\nbe generated.\n\nReproduction in flowering plants involves transfer of pollen grains from the anther\nto the stigma which is referred to as pollination.

We have discussed how some\namount of variation is produced even during asexual reproduction. And\nthe number of successful variations are maximised by the process of\nsexual reproduction. If we observe a field of sugarcane we find very little\nvariations among the individual plants. But in a number of animals\nincluding human beings, which reproduce sexually, quite distinct\nvariations are visible among different individuals. In this chapter, we\nshall be studying the mechanism by which variations are created and\n\ninherited.\n\n8.1 ACCUMULATION OF VARIATION\nDURING REPRODUCTION\n\nmr\n\nFigure 8.1\n\nCreation of diversity over succeeding\ngenerations. The original organism at the top\nwill give rise to, say, two individuals, similar\nin body design, but with subtle differences.\nEach of them, in turn, will give rise to two\nindividuals in the next generation. Each of\nthe four individuals in the bottom row will\nbe different from each other. While some of\nthese differences will be unique, others will\nbe inherited from their respective parents,\nwho were different from each other.\n\nInheritance from the previous generation provides\nboth a common basic body design, and subtle\nchanges in it, for the next generation. Now think\nabout what would happen when this new generation,\nin its turn, reproduces. The second generation will\nhave differences that they inherit from the first\ngeneration, as well as newly created differences\n(Fig. 8.1).\n\nFigure 8.1 would represent the situation if a\nsingle individual reproduces, as happens in asexual\nreproduction. If one bacterium divides, and then the\nresultant two bacteria divide again, the four\nindividual bacteria generated would be very similar.\nThere would be only very minor differences between\nthem, generated due to small inaccuracies in DNA\ncopying. However, if sexual reproduction is involved,\neven greater diversity will be generated, as we will\nsee when we discuss the rules of inheritance.\n\nDo all these variations in a species have equal\nchances of surviving in the environment in which they\nfind themselves? Obviously not. Depending on the\nnature of variations, different individuals would have\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\ndifferent kinds of advantages. Bacteria that can withstand heat will survive\nbetter in a heat wave, as we have discussed earlier. Selection of variants\nby environmental factors forms the basis for evolutionary processes, as\nwe will discuss in later sections.\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nIf a trait A exists in 10% of a population of an asexually reproducing\n\nspecies and a trait B exists in 60% of the same population, which trait\n\nis likely to have arisen earlier?\n\nHow does the creation of variations in a species promote survival?\n\n8.2 HEREDITY\n\nThe most obvious outcome of the reproductive process still remains the\ngeneration of individuals of similar design. The rules of heredity determine\nthe process by which traits and characteristics are reliably inherited. Let\nus take a closer look at these rules.\n\n8.2.1 Inherited Traits\n\nWhat exactly do we mean by similarities and differences? We know that\na child bears all the basic features of a human being. However, it does\nnot look exactly like its parents, and human populations show a great\ndeal of variation.\n\n= Observe the ears of all the students in the class. Prepare a list of\nstudents having free or attached earlobes and calculate the\npercentage of students having each (Fig. 8.2). Find out about the\nearlobes of the parents of each student in the class. Correlate the\nearlobe type of each student with that of their parents. Based on\nthis evidence, suggest a possible rule for the inheritance of earlobe\ntypes.\n\n8.2.2 Rules for the Inheritance of Traits —\nMendel’s Contributions\n\nThe rules for inheritance of such traits in human beings are related to\nthe fact that both the father and the mother contribute practically equal\namounts of genetic material to the child. This means that each trait can\nbe influenced by both paternal and maternal DNA. Thus, for each trait\nthere will be two versions in each child. What will, then, the trait seen in\nthe child be? Mendel (see box) worked out the main rules of such\ninheritance, and it is interesting to look at some of his experiments from\nmore than a century ago.\n\nHeredity\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 8.2\n\n(a) Free and (b) attached\nearlobes. The lowest part\nof the ear, called the\nearlobe, is closely attached\nto the side of the head in\nsome of us, and not\nin others. Free and\nattached earlobes are two\nvariants found in human\npopulations.\n\n129\n\n\nGregor Johann Mendel (1822-1884)\n\nMendel was educated in a monastery and went on to study science and\nmathematics at the University of Vienna. Failure in the examinations for a\nteaching certificate did not suppress his zeal for scientific quest. He went\n\nback to his monastery and started growing peas. Many others had studied\nthe inheritance of traits in peas and other organisms earlier, but Mendel\nblended his knowledge of science and mathematics and was the first one\nto keep count of individuals exhibiting a particular trait in each generation.\nThis helped him to arrive at the laws of inheritance.\n\nMendel used a number of contrasting visible characters of garden\npeas —- round/wrinkled seeds, tall/short plants, white/violet flowers and\nso on. He took pea plants with different characteristics — a tall plant and\na short plant, produced progeny by crossing them, and calculated the\npercentages of tall or short progeny.\n\nIn the first place, there were no halfway characteristics in this first-\ngeneration, or F1 progeny — no ‘medium-height’ plants. All plants were\ntall. This meant that only one of the parental traits\nwas seen, not some mixture of the two. So the next\nquestion was, were the tall plants in the Fl\ngeneration exactly the same as the tall plants of the\nparent generation? Mendelian experiments test this\nby getting both the parental plants and these F1 tall\n\nFl\n\n_? plants to reproduce by self-pollination. The progeny\n\n. “ of the parental plants are, of course, all tall. However,\nty * a all ar ine the second-generation, or F2, progeny of the F1 tall\nwr plants are not all tall. Instead, one quarter of them\n\nare short. This indicates that both the tallness and\nshortness traits were inherited in the F1 plants, but\nonly the tallness trait was expressed. This led Mendel\n\noa to propose that two copies of factor (now called genes)\n\nF2\naN controlling traits are present in sexually reproducing\n\norganism. These two may be identical, or may be\nwan Te - 7 se Fi. * i, different, depending on the parentage. A pattern of\n(Tt) (Tt) cp (tw (TT) (tt) inheritance can be worked out with this assumption,\nas shown in Fig. 8.3.\n\nFigure 8.3\nInheritance of traits\nover two generations\n\n= In Fig. 8.3, what experiment would we do to confirm that the F2\ngeneration did in fact have a 1:2:1 ratio of TT, Tt and tt trait\ncombinations?\n\nIn this explanation, both TT and Tt are tall plants, while only ttisa\nshort plant. In other words, a single copy of ‘T’ is enough to make the\nplant tall, while both copies have to be ‘t’ for the plant to be short. Traits\nlike ‘T’ are called dominant traits, while those that behave like ‘t’ are\ncalled recessive traits. Work out which trait would be considered\ndominant and which one recessive in Fig. 8.4.\n\n130 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nWhat happens when pea plants showing two different\n‘<a &\n\ncharacteristics, rather than just one, are bred with each other?\nWhat do the progeny of a tall plant with round seeds and a short\nplant with wrinkled-seeds look like? They are all tall and have\n\ncross fertilisation\n\nround seeds. Tallness and round seeds are thus dominant traits.\nBut what happens when these F1 progeny are used to generate Ft\nF2 progeny by self-pollination? A Mendelian experiment will find | self fertilisation\n\nthat some F2 progeny are tall plants with round seeds, and some\nwere short plants with wrinkled seeds. However, there would also ey & ey\nbe some F2 progeny that showed new combinations. Some of them F2\n\nwould be tall, but have wrinkled seeds, while others would be short, 3: 1 Ratio\n\nbut have round seeds. You can see as to how new combinations of Figure 8.4\n\ntraits are formed in F2 offspring when factors controlling for seed\n\nshape and seed colour recombine to form zygote leading to form 1 | x |\nF2 offspring (Fig. 8.5). Thus, the tall/short trait and the round RR yy YY\n\n(round, green) (wrinkled, yellow)\n\nseed/wrinkled seed trait are independently inherited. | |\n8.2.3 How do these Traits get Expressed? @ 9\nHow does the mechanism of heredity work? Cellular DNA is Or\nthe information source for making proteins in the cell. A section Rr Yy\n\n(round, yellow)\n\nof DNA that provides information for one protein is called the\ngene for that protein. How do proteins control the\ncharacteristics that we are discussing here? Let us take the\nexample of tallness as a characteristic. We know that plants\nhave hormones that can trigger growth. Plant height can thus\ndepend on the amount of a particular plant hormone. The\namount of the plant hormone made will depend on the\nefficiency of the process for making it. Consider now an enzyme\nthat is important for this process. If this enzyme works\nefficiently, a lot of hormone will be made, and the plant will be\ntall. If the gene for that enzyme has an alteration that makes\nthe enzyme less efficient, the amount of hormone will be less,\nand the plant will be short. Thus, genes control characteristics,\nor traits.\n\nIf the interpretations of Mendelian experiments we have been\ndiscussing are correct, then both parents must be contributing\n\nequally to the DNA of the progeny during sexual reproduction. eioeanne, gels OC»\nWe have disscussed this issue in the previous Chapter. If both TOBround, green *\nparents can help determine the trait in the progeny, both parents 101 wrinkled, yellow  § () 3\nmust be contributing a copy of the same gene. This means that 32 wrinkled, green @:\n\neach pea plant must have two sets of all genes, one inherited from\neach parent. For this mechanism to work, each germ cell must\nhave only one gene set. Figure 8.5\n\nHow do germ-cells make a single set of genes from the normal two Independent inheritance\ncopies that all other cells in the body have? If progeny plants inherited a of two separate traits,\n\n556 seeds\n\nsingle whole gene set from each parent, then the experiment explained S$\"4pe and colour of seeds\nin Fig. 8.5 cannot work. This is because the two characteristics ‘R’ and\n\n‘y’ would then be linked to each other and cannot be independently\n\nHeredity 131\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\na\n\nGametes\n\noS\n\nZygote\n\nSs\nf\n\nOffsprings K\n\nFemale\n\nFigure 8.6\nSex determination in\nhuman beings\n\n132\n\ninherited. This is explained by the fact that each gene set is present, not\nas a single long thread of DNA, but as separate independent pieces,\neach called a chromosome. Thus, each cell will have two copies of each\nchromosome, one each from the male and female parents. Every germ-\ncell will take one chromosome from each pair and these may be of either\nmaternal or paternal origin. When two germ cells combine, they will\nrestore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring\nthe stability of the DNA of the species. Such a mechanism of inheritance\nexplains the results of the Mendel experiments, and is used by all\nsexually reproducing organisms. But asexually reproducing organisms\nalso follow similar rules of inheritance. Can we work out how their\ninheritance might work?\n\n8.2.4 Sex Determination\n\nWe have discussed the idea that the two sexes participating in sexual\nreproduction must be somewhat different from each other for a number\n\n18\n\nFemale\n\nof reasons. How is the sex of a newborn individual\ndetermined? Different species use very different strategies\nfor this. Some rely entirely on environmental cues. Thus,\nin some animals like a few reptiles, the temperature at\nwhich fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the\nanimals developing in the eggs will be male or female. In\nother animals, such as snails, individuals can change sex,\nindicating that sex is not genetically determined. However,\nin human beings, the sex of the individual is largely\ngenetically determined. In other words, the genes inherited\nfrom our parents decide whether we will be boys or girls.\nBut so far, we have assumed that similar gene sets are\ninherited from both parents. If that is the case, how can\ngenetic inheritance determine sex?\n\nThe explanation lies in the fact that all human\nchromosomes are not paired. Most human chromosomes\nhave a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22\nsuch pairs. But one pair, called the sex chromosomes, is\nodd in not always being a perfect pair. Women have a\nperfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. But men\nhave a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized X\nwhile the other is a short one called Y. So women are XX,\nwhile men are XY. Now, can we work out what the\ninheritance pattern of X and Y will be?\n\nAs Fig. 8.6 shows, half the children will be boys and\nhalf will be girls. All children will inherit an X chromosome\nfrom their mother regardless of whether they are boys or\ngirls. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by\nwhat they inherit from their father. A child who inherits\nan X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one\nwho inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nHow do Mendel’s experiments show that traits may be dominant or\nrecessive?\n\nHow do Mendel’s experiments show that traits are inherited\nindependently?\n\nA man with blood group A marries a woman with blood group O and\ntheir daughter has blood group O. Is this information enough to tell you\nwhich of the traits —- blood group A or O - is dominant? Why or why not?\n\nHow is the sex of the child determined in human beings?\n\nWhat you have learnt\n\nVariations arising during the process of reproduction can be inherited.\nThese variations may lead to increased survival of the individuals.\n\nSexually reproducing individuals have two copies of genes for the same trait. If the\ncopies are not identical, the trait that gets expressed is called the dominant trait\nand the other is called the recessive trait.\n\nTraits in one individual may be inherited separately, giving rise to new combinations\nof traits in the offspring of sexual reproduction.\n\nSex is determined by different factors in various species. In human beings, the\nsex of the child depends on whether the paternal chromosome is X (for girls) or Y\n(for boys).\n\nA Mendelian experiment consisted of breeding tall pea plants bearing violet flowers\nwith short pea plants bearing white flowers. The progeny all bore violet flowers,\nbut almost half of them were short.

We have discussed how some\namount of variation is produced even during asexual reproduction. And\nthe number of successful variations are maximised by the process of\nsexual reproduction. If we observe a field of sugarcane we find very little\nvariations among the individual plants. But in a number of animals\nincluding human beings, which reproduce sexually, quite distinct\nvariations are visible among different individuals. In this chapter, we\nshall be studying the mechanism by which variations are created and\n\ninherited.\n\n8.1 ACCUMULATION OF VARIATION\nDURING REPRODUCTION\n\nmr\n\nFigure 8.1\n\nCreation of diversity over succeeding\ngenerations. The original organism at the top\nwill give rise to, say, two individuals, similar\nin body design, but with subtle differences.\nEach of them, in turn, will give rise to two\nindividuals in the next generation. Each of\nthe four individuals in the bottom row will\nbe different from each other. While some of\nthese differences will be unique, others will\nbe inherited from their respective parents,\nwho were different from each other.\n\nInheritance from the previous generation provides\nboth a common basic body design, and subtle\nchanges in it, for the next generation. Now think\nabout what would happen when this new generation,\nin its turn, reproduces. The second generation will\nhave differences that they inherit from the first\ngeneration, as well as newly created differences\n(Fig. 8.1).\n\nFigure 8.1 would represent the situation if a\nsingle individual reproduces, as happens in asexual\nreproduction. If one bacterium divides, and then the\nresultant two bacteria divide again, the four\nindividual bacteria generated would be very similar.\nThere would be only very minor differences between\nthem, generated due to small inaccuracies in DNA\ncopying. However, if sexual reproduction is involved,\neven greater diversity will be generated, as we will\nsee when we discuss the rules of inheritance.\n\nDo all these variations in a species have equal\nchances of surviving in the environment in which they\nfind themselves?

The rules of heredity determine\nthe process by which traits and characteristics are reliably inherited. Let\nus take a closer look at these rules.\n\n8.2.1 Inherited Traits\n\nWhat exactly do we mean by similarities and differences? We know that\na child bears all the basic features of a human being. However, it does\nnot look exactly like its parents, and human populations show a great\ndeal of variation.\n\n= Observe the ears of all the students in the class. Prepare a list of\nstudents having free or attached earlobes and calculate the\npercentage of students having each (Fig. 8.2). Find out about the\nearlobes of the parents of each student in the class. Correlate the\nearlobe type of each student with that of their parents. Based on\nthis evidence, suggest a possible rule for the inheritance of earlobe\ntypes.\n\n8.2.2 Rules for the Inheritance of Traits —\nMendel’s Contributions\n\nThe rules for inheritance of such traits in human beings are related to\nthe fact that both the father and the mother contribute practically equal\namounts of genetic material to the child. This means that each trait can\nbe influenced by both paternal and maternal DNA. Thus, for each trait\nthere will be two versions in each child. What will, then, the trait seen in\nthe child be? Mendel (see box) worked out the main rules of such\ninheritance, and it is interesting to look at some of his experiments from\nmore than a century ago.\n\nHeredity\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 8.2\n\n(a) Free and (b) attached\nearlobes.

        "text": "Gregor Johann Mendel (1822-1884)\n\nMendel was educated in a monastery and went on to study science and\nmathematics at the University of Vienna. Failure in the examinations for a\nteaching certificate did not suppress his zeal for scientific quest. He went\n\nback to his monastery and started growing peas. Many others had studied\nthe inheritance of traits in peas and other organisms earlier, but Mendel\nblended his knowledge of science and mathematics and was the first one\nto keep count of individuals exhibiting a particular trait in each generation.\nThis helped him to arrive at the laws of inheritance.\n\nMendel used a number of contrasting visible characters of garden\npeas —- round/wrinkled seeds, tall/short plants, white/violet flowers and\nso on. He took pea plants with different characteristics — a tall plant and\na short plant, produced progeny by crossing them, and calculated the\npercentages of tall or short progeny.\n\nIn the first place, there were no halfway characteristics in this first-\ngeneration, or F1 progeny — no ‘medium-height’ plants. All plants were\ntall. This meant that only one of the parental traits\nwas seen, not some mixture of the two. So the next\nquestion was, were the tall plants in the Fl\ngeneration exactly the same as the tall plants of the\nparent generation? Mendelian experiments test this\nby getting both the parental plants and these F1 tall\n\nFl\n\n_? plants to reproduce by self-pollination. The progeny\n\n. “ of the parental plants are, of course, all tall. However,\nty * a all ar ine the second-generation, or F2, progeny of the F1 tall\nwr plants are not all tall. Instead, one quarter of them\n\nare short. This indicates that both the tallness and\nshortness traits were inherited in the F1 plants, but\nonly the tallness trait was expressed. This led Mendel\n\noa to propose that two copies of factor (now called genes)\n\nF2\naN controlling traits are present in sexually reproducing\n\norganism. These two may be identical, or may be\nwan Te - 7 se Fi. * i, different, depending on the parentage. A pattern of\n(Tt) (Tt) cp (tw (TT) (tt) inheritance can be worked out with this assumption,\nas shown in Fig. 8.3.\n\nFigure 8.3\nInheritance of traits\nover two generations\n\n= In Fig. 8.3, what experiment would we do to confirm that the F2\ngeneration did in fact have a 1:2:1 ratio of TT, Tt and tt trait\ncombinations?\n\nIn this explanation, both TT and Tt are tall plants, while only ttisa\nshort plant. In other words, a single copy of ‘T’ is enough to make the\nplant tall, while both copies have to be ‘t’ for the plant to be short. Traits\nlike ‘T’ are called dominant traits, while those that behave like ‘t’ are\ncalled recessive traits. Work out which trait would be considered\ndominant and which one recessive in Fig. 8.4.\n\n130 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

Let us take the\nexample of tallness as a characteristic. We know that plants\nhave hormones that can trigger growth. Plant height can thus\ndepend on the amount of a particular plant hormone. The\namount of the plant hormone made will depend on the\nefficiency of the process for making it. Consider now an enzyme\nthat is important for this process. If this enzyme works\nefficiently, a lot of hormone will be made, and the plant will be\ntall. If the gene for that enzyme has an alteration that makes\nthe enzyme less efficient, the amount of hormone will be less,\nand the plant will be short. Thus, genes control characteristics,\nor traits.\n\nIf the interpretations of Mendelian experiments we have been\ndiscussing are correct, then both parents must be contributing\n\nequally to the DNA of the progeny during sexual reproduction. eioeanne, gels OC»\nWe have disscussed this issue in the previous Chapter.

    "full_text": "CHAPTER 9\n\nLight — Reflection and\nRefraction\n\n1064CH10\n\nW: see a variety of objects in the world around us. However, we are\nunable to see anything in a dark room. On lighting up the room,\nthings become visible. What makes things visible? During the day, the\nsunlight helps us to see objects. An object reflects light that falls on it.\nThis reflected light, when received by our eyes, enables us to see things.\nWe are able to see through a transparent medium as light is transmitted\nthrough it. There are a number of common wonderful phenomena\nassociated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling\nof stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a medium\nand so on. A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them.\nBy observing the common optical phenomena around us, we may\nconclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact that a small\nsource of light casts a sharp shadow of an opaque object points to this\nstraight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light.\n\nIn this Chapter, we shall study the phenomena of reflection and\nrefraction of light using the straight-line propagation of light. These basic\nconcepts will help us in the study of some of the optical phenomena in\nnature. We shall try to understand in this Chapter the reflection of light\nby spherical mirrors and refraction of light and their application in real\nlife situations.\n\n9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT\n\nA highly polished surface, such as a mirror, reflects most of the light\nfalling on it. You are already familiar with the laws of reflection of light.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nLet us recall these laws —\n(i) The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and\n(ii) The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence\nand the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.\n\nThese laws of reflection are applicable to all types of reflecting surfaces\nincluding spherical surfaces. You are familiar with the formation of image\nby a plane mirror. What are the properties of the image? Image formed\nby a plane mirror is always virtual and erect. The size of the image is\nequal to that of the object. The image formed is as far behind the mirror\nas the object is in front of it. Further, the image is laterally inverted.\nHow would the images be when the reflecting surfaces are curved? Let\nus explore.\n\n= Take a large shining spoon. Try to view your face in its curved\nsurface.\n\n= Do you get the image? Is it smaller or larger?\n\n= Move the spoon slowly away from your face. Observe the image.\nHow does it change?\n\n= Reverse the spoon and repeat the Activity. How does the image\nlook like now?\n\n= Compare the characteristics of the image on the two surfaces.\n\nThe curved surface of a shining spoon could be considered as a curved\nmirror. The most commonly used type of curved mirror is the spherical\nmirror. The reflecting surface of such mirrors can be considered to form\na part of the surface of a sphere. Such mirrors, whose reflecting surfaces\nare spherical, are called spherical mirrors. We shall now study about\nspherical mirrors in some detail.\n\n9.2 SPHERICAL MIRRORS\n\nThe reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or\noutwards. Aspherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards,\nthat is, faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror.\nA spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called\na convex mirror. The schematic representation of these mirrors is shown\nin Fig. 9.1. You may note in these diagrams that the back\nof the mirror is shaded.\n\nYou may now understand that the surface of the spoon\ncurved inwards can be approximated to a concave mirror\nand the surface of the spoon bulged outwards can be\napproximated to a convex mirror.\n\nBefore we move further on spherical mirrors, we need to\nrecognise and understand the meaning of a few terms. These\n\nterms are commonly used in discussions about spherical (a) Concave mirror\n\nmirrors. The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical Figure 9.1\n\n(b) Convex mirror\n\nmirror is a point called the pole. It lies on the surface ofthe Schematic representation of spherical\nmirror. The pole is usually represented by the letter P. mirrors; the shaded side is non-reflecting.\n\nLight — Reflection and Refraction\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n135\n\n\nAt\ninfinity\n\nThe reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part of a sphere.\nThis sphere has a centre. This point is called the centre of curvature of\nthe spherical mirror. It is represented by the letter C. Please note that the\ncentre of curvature is not a part of the mirror. It lies outside its reflecting\nsurface. The centre of curvature of a concave mirror lies in front of it.\nHowever, it lies behind the mirror in case of a convex mirror. You may\nnote this in Fig.9.2 (a) and (b). The radius of the sphere of which the\nreflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radius\nof curvature of the mirror. It is represented by the letter R. You may note\nthat the distance PC is equal to the radius of curvature. Imagine a straight\nline passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical\nmirror. This line is called the principal axis. Remember that principal\naxis is normal to the mirror at its pole. Let us understand an important\nterm related to mirrors, through an Activity.\n\nCAUTION: Do not look at the Sun directly or even into a mirror\nreflecting sunlight. It may damage your eyes.\n\n= Hold a concave mirror in your hand and direct its reflecting surface\ntowards the Sun.\n\n= Direct the light reflected by the mirror on to a sheet of paper held\nclose to the mirror.\n\n= Move the sheet of paper back and forth gradually until you find\non the paper sheet a bright, sharp spot of light.\n\n= Hold the mirror and the paper in the same position for a few\nminutes. What do you observe? Why?\n\nThe paper at first begins to burn producing smoke. Eventually it\nmay even catch fire. Why does it burn? The light from the Sun is converged\nat a point, as a sharp, bright spot by the mirror. In fact, this spot of light\nis the image of the Sun on the sheet of paper. This point is\nthe focus of the concave mirror. The heat produced due to\nthe concentration of sunlight ignites the paper. The distance\nof this image from the position of the mirror gives the\napproximate value of focal length of the mirror.\n\nLet us try to understand this observation with the help\nof a ray diagram.\n\nObserve Fig.9.2 (a) closely. A number of rays parallel\nto the principal axis are falling on a concave mirror. Observe\nthe reflected rays. They are all meeting/intersecting at a\npoint on the principal axis of the mirror. This point is called\n\nAt\ninfinity\n\nFigure 9.2\n(a) Concave mirror\n(b) Convex mirror\n\n136\n\n—-.. the principal focus of the concave mirror. Similarly, observe\nFig. 9.2 (b). How are the rays parallel to the principal axis,\nreflected by a convex mirror? The reflected rays appear to\ncome from a point on the principal axis. This point is called\nthe principal focus of the convex mirror. The principal focus\nis represented by the letter F. The distance between the\npole and the principal focus of a spherical mirror is called\nthe focal length. It is represented by the letter f\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nThe reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is by-and-large spherical.\nThe surface, then, has a circular outline. The diameter of the reflecting\nsurface of spherical mirror is called its aperture. In Fig.9.2, distance MN\nrepresents the aperture. We shall consider in our discussion only such\nspherical mirrors whose aperture is much smaller than its radius of\ncurvature.\n\nIs there a relationship between the radius of curvature R, and focal\nlength f, of a spherical mirror? For spherical mirrors of small apertures,\nthe radius of curvature is found to be equal to twice the focal length. We\nput this as R= 2f. This implies that the principal focus of a spherical\nmirror lies midway between the pole and centre of curvature.\n\n9.2.1 Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors\n\nYou have studied about the image formation by plane mirrors. You also\nknow the nature, position and relative size of the images formed by them.\nHow about the images formed by spherical mirrors? How can we locate\nthe image formed by a concave mirror for different positions of the object?\nAre the images real or virtual? Are they enlarged, diminished or have\nthe same size? We shall explore this with an Activity.\n\nYou have already learnt a way of determining the focal length of a\n\nconcave mirror. In Activity 9.2, you have seen that the sharp bright\n\nspot of light you got on the paper is, in fact, the image of the Sun. It\n\nwas a tiny, real, inverted image. You got the approximate focal length\n\nof the concave mirror by measuring the distance of the image from\n\nthe mirror.\n\n= Take a concave mirror. Find out its approximate focal length in\nthe way described above. Note down the value of focal length. (You\ncan also find it out by obtaining image of a distant object on a\nsheet of paper.)\n\n= Mark a line on a Table with a chalk. Place the concave mirror on\na stand. Place the stand over the line such that its pole lies over\nthe line.\n\n= Draw with a chalk two more lines parallel to the previous line\nsuch that the distance between any two successive lines is equal\nto the focal length of the mirror. These lines will now correspond\nto the positions of the points P, F and C, respectively. Remember -\nFor a spherical mirror of small aperture, the principal focus F lies\nmid-way between the pole P and the centre of curvature C.\n\n= Keep a bright object, say a burning candle, at a position far beyond\nC. Place a paper screen and move it in front of the mirror till you\nobtain a sharp bright image of the candle flame on. it.\n\n= Observe the image carefully. Note down its nature, position and\nrelative size with respect to the object size.\n\n= Repeat the activity by placing the candle — (a) just beyond C,\n(b) at C, (c) between F and C, (d) at F, and (e) between P and F.\n\n= In one of the cases, you may not get the image on the screen.\nIdentify the position of the object in such a case. Then, look for its\nvirtual image in the mirror itself.\n\n= Note down and tabulate your observations.\n\nLight — Reflection and Refraction\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n137\n\n\nYou will see in the above Activity that the nature, position and size of\nthe image formed by a concave mirror depends on the position of the\nobject in relation to points P, F and C. The image formed is real for some\npositions of the object. It is found to be a virtual image for a certain other\nposition. The image is either magnified, reduced or has the same size,\ndepending on the position of the object. A summary of these observations\nis given for your reference in Table 9.1.\n\nTable 9.1 Image formation by a concave mirror for different positions of the object\n\nPosition of the\n\n138\n\nPosition of the Size of the Nature of the\n\n9.2.2 Representation of Images Formed by Spherical\nMirrors Using Ray Diagrams\n\nWe can also study the formation of images by spherical mirrors by\ndrawing ray diagrams. Consider an extended object, of finite size, placed\nin front of a spherical mirror. Each small portion of the extended object\nacts like a point source. An infinite number of rays originate from each\nof these points. To construct the ray diagrams, in order to locate the\nimage of an object, an arbitrarily large number of rays emanating froma\npoint could be considered. However, it is more convenient to consider\nonly two rays, for the sake of clarity of the ray diagram. These rays are\nso chosen that it is easy to know their directions after reflection from the\nmirror.\n\nThe intersection of at least two reflected rays give the position of image\nof the point object. Any two of the following rays can be considered for\nlocating the image.\n\n(i) A ray parallel to the principal\naxis, after reflection, will pass\nthrough the principal focus\nin case of a concave mirror\nor appear to diverge from\nthe principal focus in\ncase of a convex mirror.\nThis is illustrated in Fig.9.3\n\nFigure 9.3 (a) and (b).\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n(ii) A ray passing through the\nprincipal focus of a concave\nmirror or a ray which is\ndirected towards the\nprincipal focus of a convex\nmirror, after reflection, will\nemerge parallel to the\nprincipal axis. This is\nillustrated in Fig.9.4 (a)\nand (b). (a) (b)\n\n(iii) A ray passing through the Figure 9.4\n\ncentre of curvature of a\nconcave mirror or directed\nin the direction of the centre\nof curvature of a convex\nmirror, after reflection, is\nreflected back along the\nsame path. This is\nillustrated in Fig.9.5 (a) and\n(b). The light rays come back @ ()\nalong the same path\nbecause the incident rays\nfall on the mirror along the\nnormal to the reflecting\nsurface.\n\nFigure 9.5\n\n(iv) A ray incident obliquely to\nthe principal axis, towards\na point P (pole of the mirror),\non the concave mirror\n[Fig. 9.6 (a)] or a convex\nmirror [Fig. 9.6 (b)], is\nreflected obliquely. The\nincident and reflected rays\nfollow the laws of reflection\nat the point of incidence\n(point P), making equal Figure 9.6\nangles with the principal axis.\n\nRemember that in all the above cases the laws of reflection are followed.\nAt the point of incidence, the incident ray is reflected in such a way that\nthe angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.\n\n(a) Image formation by Concave Mirror\nFigure 9.7 illustrates the ray diagrams for the formation of image\nby a concave mirror for various positions of the object.\n\nLight — Reflection and Refraction 139\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nAt\ninfinity\n\n“At\ninfinity\n\n(e) )\n\nFigure 9.7 Ray diagrams for the image formation by a concave mirror\n\n= Draw neat ray diagrams for each position of the object shown in\nTable 9.1.\n\n= You may take any two of the rays mentioned in the previous section\nfor locating the image.\n\n= Compare your diagram with those given in Fig. 9.7.\n\n= Describe the nature, position and relative size of the image formed\nin each case.\n\n= Tabulate the results in a convenient format.\n\nUses of concave mirrors\n\nConcave mirrors are commonly used in torches, search-lights and\nvehicles headlights to get powerful parallel beams of light. They are\noften used as shaving mirrors to see a larger image of the face. The\ndentists use concave mirrors to see large images of the teeth of patients.\nLarge concave mirrors are used to concentrate sunlight to produce\nheat in solar furnaces.\n\n(b) Image formation by a Convex Mirror\nWe studied the image formation by a concave mirror. Now we shall\nstudy the formation of image by a convex mirror.\n\n140 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n= Take a convex mirror. Hold it in one hand.\n\n= Hold a pencil in the upright position in the other hand.\n\n= Observe the image of the pencil in the mirror. Is the image erect or\ninverted? Is it diminished or enlarged?\n\n= Move the pencil away from the mirror slowly. Does the image\nbecome smaller or larger?\n\n= Repeat this Activity carefully. State whether the image will move\ncloser to or farther away from the focus as the object is moved\naway from the mirror?\n\nWe consider two positions of the object for studying the image formed\nby a convex mirror. First is when the object is at infinity and the second\nposition is when the object is at a finite distance from the mirror. The ray\ndiagrams for the formation of image by a convex mirror for these two\npositions of the object are shown in Fig.9.8 (a) and (b), respectively. The\nresults are summarised in Table 9.2.\n\n(a)\n\nFigure 9.8 Formation of image by a convex mirror\n\nTable 9.2 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a convex mirror\n\nPosition of the Position of the Size of the Nature of the\nobject image image image\n\nAt infinity At the focus F, Highly diminished, Virtual and erect\nbehind the mirror point-sized\n\nBetween infinity Between P and F, Diminished Virtual and erect\n\nand the pole P of behind the mirror\n\nthe mirror\n\nYou have so far studied the image formation by a plane mirror, a\nconcave mirror and a convex mirror. Which of these mirrors will give the\nfull image of a large object? Let us explore through an Activity.\n\n= Observe the image of a distant object, say a distant tree, in a\nplane mirror.\n= Could you see a full-length image?\n\nLight — Reflection and Refraction 141\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n= Try with plane mirrors of different sizes. Did you see the entire\nobject in the image?\n\n= Repeat this Activity with a concave mirror. Did the mirror show\nfull length image of the object?\n\n= Now try using a convex mirror. Did you succeed? Explain your\nobservations with reason.\n\nYou can see a full-length image of a tall building/tree in a small\nconvex mirror. One such mirror is fitted in a wall of Agra Fort facing Taj\nMahal. If you visit the Agra Fort, try to observe the full image of Taj\nMahal. To view distinctly, you should stand suitably at the terrace\nadjoining the wall.\n\nUses of convex mirrors\n\nConvex mirrors are commonly used as rear-view (wing) mirrors in\nvehicles. These mirrors are fitted on the sides of the vehicle, enabling the\ndriver to see traffic behind him/her to facilitate safe driving. Convex\nmirrors are preferred because they always give an erect, though\ndiminished, image. Also, they have a wider field of view as they are curved\noutwards. Thus, convex mirrors enable the driver to view much larger\narea than would be possible with a plane mirror.\n\nQ U E S BR*YO NAS\n\nDefine the principal focus of a concave mirror.\n\nThe radius of curvature of a spherical mirror is 20 cm. What is its focal\nlength?\n\nName a mirror that can givean erect and enlarged image of an object.\n\nWhy do we prefer a convex mirror as a rear-view mirror in vehicles?\n\n9.2.3 Sign Convention for Reflection by Spherical Mirrors\n\nWhile dealing with the reflection of light by spherical mirrors, we shall\nfollow a set of sign conventions called the New Cartesian Sign\nConvention. In this convention, the pole (P) of the mirror is taken as the\norigin (Fig. 9.9). The principal axis of the mirror is taken as the x-axis\n(XX) of the coordinate system. The conventions are as follows —\n\n(i) The object is always placed to the left of the mirror. This implies\nthat the light from the object falls on the mirror from the left-hand\nside.\n\n(ii) All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the\npole of the mirror.\n\n(iii) All the distances measured to the right of the origin (along\n+ x-axis) are taken as positive while those measured to the left of\nthe origin (along — x-axis) are taken as negative.\n\n(iv) Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis\n(along + y-axis) are taken as positive.\n\n(v) Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis\n(along -y-axis) are taken as negative.\n\n142 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nThe New Cartesian Sign Convention described above is illustrated in\nFig.9.9 for your reference. These sign conventions are applied to obtain\nthe mirror formula and solve related numerical problems.\n\n9.2.4 Mirror Formula and Magnification\n\nIn a spherical mirror, the distance of the\nobject from its pole is called the object  — Object on the left\n\ndistance (u). The distance of the image from Direction of ‘\nthe pole of the mirror is called the image A “incident ight”\ndistance (uv). You already know that the\ndistance of the principal focus from the pole a ‘as | , Distance towards Distance towards\nis called the focal length (f). There is a (+ve) the left (-ve) the right (ve)\nrelationship between these three quantities __ r\ngiven by the mirror formula which is * B B a\nexpressed as\nHeight\n\n1 yi _ i 9.1) downwards (-ve)\n\nyu ff bf\nThis formula is valid in all situations for all Mirror —]\nspherical mirrors for all positions of the mn\n\nobject. You must use the New Cartesian Sign Figure 9.9\nConvention while substituting numerical The New Cartesian Sign Convention for spherical mirrors\n\nvalues for u, v, f,; and Rin the mirror formula\nfor solving problems.\n\nMagnification\nMagnification produced by a spherical mirror gives the relative extent to\nwhich the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size.\nIt is expressed as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the\nobject. It is usually represented by the letter m.\n\nIf his the height of the object and h’is the height of the image, then\nthe magnification m produced by a spherical mirror is given by\n\nHeight of the image (h’)\n™™* Height of the object (h)\n\nt= 7 (9.2)\nThe magnification m is also related to the object distance (u) and\nimage distance (vu). It can be expressed as:\n\n)\n\nMagnification (m) = ‘ =- = (9,3)\n\nYou may note that the height of the object is taken to be positive as\nthe object is usually placed above the principal axis. The height of the\nimage should be taken as positive for virtual images. However, it is to be\ntaken as negative for real images. A negative sign in the value of the\nmagnification indicates that the image is real. A positive sign in the value\nof the magnification indicates that the image is virtual.\n\nLight — Reflection and Refraction 143\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n144\n\nExample 9.1\n\nA convex mirror used for rear-view on an automobile has a radius of\ncurvature of 3.00 m.

Where is the image located?\n\n9.3 REFRACTION OF LIGHT\n\nLight seems to travel along straight-line paths in a transparent medium.\nWhat happens when light enters from one transparent medium to\nanother? Does it still move along a straight-line path or change its\ndirection? We shall recall some of our day-to-day experiences.\n\nYou might have observed that the bottom of a tank or a pond\ncontaining water appears to be raised. Similarly, when a thick glass slab\nis placed over some printed matter, the letters appear raised when viewed\nthrough the glass slab. Why does it happen? Have you seen a pencil\npartly immersed in water in a glass tumbler? It appears to be displaced\nat the interface of air and water. You might have observed that a lemon\nkept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its actual\nsize, when viewed from the sides. How can you account for such\nexperiences?\n\nLet us consider the case of the apparent displacement of a pencil,\npartly immersed in water. The light reaching you from the portion of the\npencil inside water seems to come from a different direction, compared\nto the part above water. This makes the pencil appear to be displaced at\nthe interface. For similar reasons, the letters appear to be raised, when\nseen through a glass slab placed over it.\n\nDoes a pencil appear to be displaced to the same extent, ifinstead of\nwater, we use liquids like kerosene or turpentine? Will the letters appear\nto rise to the same height if we replace a glass slab with a transparent\nplastic slab? You will find that the extent of the effect is different for\ndifferent pair of media. These observations indicate that light does not\n\nLight — Reflection and Refraction 145\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n146\n\ntravel in the same direction in all media. It appears that when travelling\nobliquely from one medium to another, the direction of propagation of\nlight in the second medium changes. This phenomenon is known as\nrefraction of light. Let us understand this phenomenon further by doing\na few activities.\n\nPlace a coin at the bottom of a bucket filled with water.\n\nWith your eye to a side above water, try to pick up the coin in one\ngo. Did you succeed in picking up the coin?\n\nRepeat the Activity. Why did you not succeed in doing it in one go?\nAsk your friends to do this. Compare your experience with theirs.\n\n= Place a large shallow bowl on a Table and put a coin in it.\n\n= Move away slowly from the bowl. Stop when the coin just\ndisappears from your sight.\n\n= Ask a friend to pour water gently into the bowl without disturbing\nthe coin.\n\n= Keep looking for the coin from your position. Does the coin becomes\nvisible again from your position? How could this happen?\n\nThe coin becomes visible again on pouring water into the bowl. The\ncoin appears slightly raised above its actual position due to refraction of\nlight.\n\n= Draw a thick straight line in ink, over a sheet of white paper placed\non a Table.\n\n= Place a glass slab over the line in such a way that one of its edges\nmakes an angle with the line.\n\n= Look at the portion of the line under the slab from the sides. What\ndo you observe? Does the line under the glass slab appear to be\nbent at the edges?\n\n= Next, place the glass slab such that it is normal to the line. What\ndo you observe now? Does the part of the line under the glass slab\nappear bent?\n\n= Look at the line from the top of the glass slab. Does the part of the\nline, beneath the slab, appear to be raised? Why does this happen?\n\n9.3.1 Refraction through a Rectangular Glass Slab\n\nTo understand the phenomenon of refraction of light through a glass\nslab, let us do an Activity.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nFix a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using drawing pins.\n\n= Place a rectangular glass slab over the sheet in the middle.\n\n= Draw the outline of the slab with a pencil. Let us name the outline\nas ABCD.\n\n= Take four identical pins.\nFix two pins, say E and F, vertically such that the line joining the\npins is inclined to the edge AB.\n\n= Look for the images of the pins E and F through the opposite edge.\nFix two other pins, say G and H, such that these pins and the\nimages of E and F lie on a straight line.\n\n= Remove the pins and the slab.\n\n= Join the positions of tip of the pins E and F and produce the line\nup to AB. Let EF meet AB at O. Similarly, join the positions of tip\nof the pins G and H and produce it up to the edge CD. Let HG\nmeet CD at O”%\n\n= Join O and O”% Also produce EF up to P, as shown by a dotted line\n\nin Fig. 9.10.\n\nIn this Activity, you will note, the light ray has changed its direction\nat points O and O”% Note that both the points O and O’ lie on surfaces\nseparating two transparent media. Draw a perpendicular NN’ to AB at O\nand another perpendicular MM’to CD at O% The light ray at point O has\nentered from a rarer medium to a denser medium, that is, from air to\n\nglass. Note that the light ray has bent towards\nthe normal. At O’, the light ray has entered\nfrom glass to air, that is, from a denser\nmedium to a rarer medium. The light here\nhas bent away from the normal. Compare the\nangle of incidence with the angle of refraction\nat both refracting surfaces AB and CD.\n\nIn Fig. 9.10, a ray EO is obliquely\nincident on surface AB, called incident ray.\nOO’ is the refracted ray and O’H is the\nemergent ray. You may observe that the\nemergent ray is parallel to the direction of\nthe incident ray. Why does it happen so? The\nextent of bending of the ray of light at the\nopposite parallel faces AB (air-glass interface)\nand CD (glass-air interface) of the rectangular\nglass slab is equal and opposite. This is why\nthe ray emerges parallel to the incident ray.\nHowever, the light ray is shifted sideward\nslightly. What happens when a light ray is\nincident normally to the interface of two\nmedia? Try and find out.\n\n1\n\\\nN''r,\\\\\n\\\n\\\nGlass —>} ‘e\nslab \\\n\\\n\\\n_\\\nL\\\n\\\nCc Mo D Air\nONG\n\\\nMi a\n\\p\n\nFigure 9.10\nRefraction of light through a rectangular glass slab\n\nNow you are familiar with the refraction of light. Refraction is due to\nchange in the speed of light as it enters from one transparent medium to\nanother. Experiments show that refraction of light occurs according to\n\ncertain laws.\n\nLight — Reflection and Refraction\n\n147\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nThe following are the laws of refraction of light.\n\n(i) The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface\nof two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the\nsame plane.\n\n(ii) The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of\nrefraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for\nthe given pair of media. This law is also known as Snell’s law of\nrefraction. (This is true for angle 0 < i< 90°)\n\nIf iis the angle of incidence and ris the angle of refraction, then,\nsini\n\n: = constant (9.4)\nsinr\n\nThis constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium\nwith respect to the first. Let us study about refractive index in some detail.\n\n9.3.2 The Refractive Index\n\nYou have already studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely from\none transparent medium into another will change its direction in the\nsecond medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place\nin a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,\nthe “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).\n\nThe refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,\nthe relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns\nout that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light\ntravels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3x10 ms\"!. In air, the speed of\nlight is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces\nconsiderably in glass or water. The value of the refractive index for a\ngiven pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as\ngiven below.\n\nConsider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as\nshown in Fig.9.11. Let v, be the speed of light in medium 1 and v, be the\nspeed of light in medium 2. The refractive index of medium 2 with respect\nto medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and\nthe speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol\nn,,- This can be expressed in an equation form as\n\nMedium 1 Speed of light in medium 1 __iv,\n(Ain) n,,= a = (9.5)\nSpeed of light in medium 2 _ v,\n(Ges By the same argument, the refractive index of medium\n1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n.,,. It is given\nby\nn= Speed of light in medium 2 _ v, (9.6)\nFigure 9.11 2 Speed of light in medium 1 v, :\n\nIf medium 1 is vacuum or air, then the refractive index of medium 2\nis considered with respect to vacuum. This is called the absolute refractive\nindex of the medium. It is simply represented as n,. If c is the speed of\n\n148 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nlight in air and vis the speed of light in the medium, then, the refractive\nindex of the medium n,, is given by\nSpeed of light in air c\n\nm= ee a (9.7)\n™ Speed of light in the medium vv\n\nThe absolute refractive index of a medium is simply called its refractive\nindex. The refractive index of several media is given in Table 9.3. From\nthe Table you can know that the refractive index of water, n,, = 1.33.\nThis means that the ratio of the speed of light in air and the speed of\nlight in water is equal to 1.33. Similarly, the refractive index of crown\nglass, n, =1.52. Such data are helpful in many places. However, you\nneed not memorise the data.\n\nTable 9.3 Absolute refractive index of some material media\n\nMaterial Refractive Material Refractive\nmedium index medium index\n\n1.0003 Canada 1s)\n\nBalsam\n\nee 1B\n\nWater Les) Rock salt 54\n\nAlcohol 1.36\n\nKerosene 1.44 Carbon G3\ndisulphide\n\nFused 1.46\n\nquartz Dense 1.65\nflint glass\n\nTurpentine 1.47\n\noil Ruby y.71\n\nBenzene 1.50\nSapphire 1.77\n\nCrown lp,\n\nglass Diamond 2.42\n\nNote from Table 9.3 that an optically denser medium may not possess\ngreater mass density.

In which of these does\nthe light travel fastest? Use the information given in Table 9.3.\n\nThe refractive index of diamond is 2.42. What is the meaning of this\nstatement?\n\n9.3.3 Refraction by Spherical Lenses\n\nYou might have seen watchmakers using a small magnifying glass to\nsee tiny parts. Have you ever touched the surface of a magnifying glass\nwith your hand? Is it plane surface or curved? Is it thicker in the middle\nor at the edges? The glasses used in spectacles and that by a watchmaker\nare examples of lenses. What is a lens? How does it bend light rays? We\nshall discuss these in this section.\n\nA transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both\nsurfaces are spherical, forms a lens. This means\nthat a lens is bound by at least one spherical\nsurface. In such lenses, the other surface would\nbe plane. A lens may have two spherical\nsurfaces, bulging outwards. Such a lens is called\na double convex lens. It is simply called a convex\nlens. It is thicker at the middle as compared to\nthe edges. Convex lens converges light rays as\nshown in Fig. 9.12 (a). Hence convex lenses are\nalso called converging lenses. Similarly, a double\nconcave lens is bounded by two spherical\nsurfaces, curved inwards. It is thicker at the\nedges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge\nlight rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lenses\nare also called diverging lenses. A double concave\nlens is simply called a concave lens.\n\nA lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens,\nhas two spherical surfaces. Each of these surfaces\nFi forms a part of a sphere. The centres of these\n\nigure 9.12\n(a) Converging action of a convex lens, (b) diverging SPheres are called centres of curvature of the lens.\naction of a concave lens The centre of curvature of a lens is usually\nrepresented by the letter C. Since there are two\ncentres of curvature, we may represent them as C, and C,. An imaginary\nstraight line passing through the two centres of curvature of a lens is\ncalled its principal axis. The central point of a lens is its optical centre. It is\n\n150 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nusually represented by the letter O. A ray of light through the optical\ncentre of a lens passes without suffering any deviation. The effective\ndiameter of the circular outline of a spherical lens is called its aperture.\nWe shall confine our discussion in this Chapter to such lenses whose\naperture is much less than its radius of curvature and the two centres of\ncurvatures are equidistant from the optical centre O. Such lenses are\ncalled thin lenses with small apertures. What happens when parallel rays\nof light are incident on a lens? Let us do an Activity to understand this.\n\nCAUTION: Do not look at the Sun directly or through a lens while\ndoing this Activity or otherwise. You may damage your eyes if you\ndo so.\n\n= Hold a convex lens in your hand. Direct it towards the Sun.\n\n= Focus the light from the Sun on a sheet of paper. Obtain a sharp\nbright image of the Sun.\n\n= Hold the paper and the lens in the same position for a while. Keep\nobserving the paper. What happened? Why? Recall your experience\nin Activity 9.2.\n\nThe paper begins to burn producing smoke. It may even catch fire\nafter a while. Why does this happen? The light from the Sun constitutes\nparallel rays of light. These rays were converged by the lens at the sharp\nbright spot formed on the paper. In fact, the bright spot you got on the\npaper is a real image of the Sun. The concentration of the sunlight at a\npoint generated heat. This caused the paper to burn.\n\nNow, we shall consider rays of light parallel to the principal axis ofa\nlens. What happens when you pass such rays of light through a lens?\nThis is illustrated for a convex lens in Fig.9.12 (a) and for a concave lens\nin Fig.9.12 (b).\n\nObserve Fig.9.12 (a) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a convex lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are converging to a point on the principal axis. This point\non the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. Let us see\nnow the action of a concave lens.\n\nObserve Fig.9.12 (b) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a concave lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are appearing to diverge from a point on the principal\naxis. This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the\nconcave lens.\n\nIf you pass parallel rays from the opposite surface of the lens, you\nget another principal focus on the opposite side. Letter F is usually used\nto represent principal focus. However, a lens has two principal foci. They\nare represented by F, and F,. The distance of the principal focus from\nthe optical centre of a lens is called its focal length. The letter f is used to\nrepresent the focal length. How can you find the focal length of a convex\nlens? Recall the Activity 9.11. In this Activity, the distance between the\nposition of the lens and the position of the image of the Sun gives the\napproximate focal length of the lens.\n\nLight — Reflection and Refraction\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n151\n\n\n9.3.4 Image Formation by Lenses\n\nLenses form images by refracting light.

Mark them with appropriate letters such as\n2F,, F,, F, and 2F,, respectively.\n\n= Place a burning candle, far beyond 2F, to the left. Obtain a clear\nsharp image on a screen on the opposite side of the lens.\n\n= Note down the nature, position and relative size of the image.\n\n= Repeat this Activity by placing object just behind 2F,, between F,\nand 2F, at F,, between F, and O. Note down and tabulate your\nobservations.\n\nThe nature, position and relative size of the image formed by convex\nlens for various positions of the object is summarised in Table 9.4.\n\nTable 9.4 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a convex lens for various\npositions of the object\n\nPosition of the Position of Relative size of Nature of\nobject the image the image the image\n\nAt infinity At focus F, Highly diminished, Real and inverted\npoint-sized\n\nBeyond 2F, Between F, and 2F, Diminished Real and inverted\nANAS, At 2F, Same size Real and inverted\nBetween F, and 2F, Beyond 2F, Enlarged Real and inverted\nAt focus F, At infinity Image would not be formed\nBetween focus F, On the same side Enlarged Virtual and erect\nand of the lens as the\n\noptical centre O object\n\nLet us now do an Activity to study the nature, position and relative\nsize of the image formed by a concave lens.\n\n152 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n= Take a concave lens. Place it on a lens stand.\n\n= Place a burning candle on one side of the lens.\n\n= Look through the lens from the other side and observe the image.\nTry to get the image on a screen, if possible. If not, observe the\nimage directly through the lens.\n\n= Note down the nature, relative size and approximate position of\nthe image.\n\n= Move the candle away from the lens. Note the change in the size\nof the image. What happens to the size of the image when the\ncandle is placed too far away from the lens.\n\nThe summary of the above Activity is given in Table 9.5 below.\n\nTable 9.5 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a concave lens for various\npositions of the object\n\nPosition of the Position of Relative size of Nature of\nobject the image the image the image\n\nAt infinity At focus F, Highly diminished, Virtual and erect\npoint-sized\n\nBetween infinity and Between focus F, Diminished Virtual and erect\noptical centre O and optical centre O\nof the lens\n\nWhat conclusion can you draw from this Activity? A concave lens\nwill always give a virtual, erect and diminished image, irrespective of the\nposition of the object.\n\n9.3.5 Image Formation in Lenses Using Ray Diagrams\n\nWe can represent image formation by lenses using ray diagrams. Ray\ndiagrams will also help us to study the nature, position and relative size\nof the image formed by lenses. For drawing ray diagrams in lenses, alike\nof spherical mirrors, we consider any two of the following rays —\n\n(i) Array of light from the object, parallel to the principal axis, after\nrefraction from a convex lens, passes through the principal focus\non the other side of the lens, as shown in Fig. 9.13 (a). In case of\na concave lens,\nthe ray appears\nto diverge from\n\n[\\\nthe principal _—\n_\n\nfocus located\non the same\nside of the lens,\nas shown in (a) (b)\nFig. 9.13 (b).\n\nme\nwe\n\nFigure 9.13\n\nLight — Reflection and Refraction 153\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n(ii) A ray of light passing\nthrough a principal\nfocus, after refraction\nfrom a convex lens, will\nemerge parallel to the\nprincipal axis. This is\nshown in Fig. 9.14 (a). A\nray of light appearing to\nmeet at the principal\n\nFigure 9.14 focus of a concave lens,\nafter refraction, will\nemerge parallel to the\nprincipal axis. This is\nshown in Fig.9.14 (b).\n\n(ii) A ray of light passing\nthrough the optical\ncentre of a lens will\nemerge without any\ndeviation. This is\n\n@ (b) illustrated in Fig.9.15(a)\n\nFigure 9.15 and Fig.9.15 (b).\n\n(a)\n\nThe ray diagrams for the image formation in a convex lens for a few\npositions of the object are shown in Fig. 9.16. The ray diagrams\nrepresenting the image formation in a concave lens for various positions\nof the object are shown in Fig. 9.17.\n\n154 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nFigure 9.16 The position, size and the nature of the image formed by\na convex lens for various positions of the object\n\nFigure 9.17 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a concave lens\n\n9.3.6 Sign Convention for Spherical Lenses\n\nFor lenses, we follow sign convention, similar to the one used for spherical\nmirrors. We apply the rules for signs of distances, except that all\nmeasurements are taken from the optical centre of the lens. According\nto the convention, the focal length of a convex lens is positive and that of\na concave lens is negative. You must take care to apply appropriate\nsigns for the values of u, v, f/ object height h and image height h’.\n\n9.3.7 Lens Formula and Magnification\n\nAs we have a formula for spherical mirrors, we also have formula for\nspherical lenses. This formula gives the relationship between object-\ndistance (u), image-distance (v) and the focal length (f). The lens formula\nis expressed as\n\n= 3 (9.8)\n\nThe lens formula given above is general and is valid in all situations\nfor any spherical lens. Take proper care of the signs of different quantities,\nwhile putting numerical values for solving problems relating to lenses.\n\nLight — Reflection and Refraction 155\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n156\n\nMagnification\n\nThe magnification produced by a lens, similar to that for spherical\nmirrors, is defined as the ratio of the height of the image and the height\nof the object. Magnification is represented by the letter m. If h is the\nheight of the object and h’is the height of the image given by a lens, then\nthe magnification produced by the lens is given by,\n\n_ Height of the Image _h’\n\n= 2:9\nHeight of the object h aie\n\nMagnification produced by a lens is also related to the object-distance\nu, and the image-distance v. This relationship is given by\n\nMagnification (m) =h’/h=v/u (9.10)\n\nExample 9.3\n\nA concave lens has focal length of 15 cm. At what distance should\nthe object from the lens be placed so that it forms an image at 10 cm\nfrom the lens? Also, find the magnification produced by the lens.\n\nSolution\nA concave lens always forms a virtual, erect image on the same side\nof the object.\n\nImage-distance v = -10cm;\nFocal length f = -15cm;\nObject-distanceu = ?\nsmoe 2 - 1 of\nince > 7 f\n1 a5\nrin, es,\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n+\nu -10 (-15) 10 15\n\n1 -3+2 1\nu 30 -30\nor, u=—-30cm\nThus, the object-distance is 30 cm.\nMagnification m= v/u\n-10cm 1\nm= —7—=3 i\n-—30cm 3\nThe positive sign shows that the image is erect and virtual. The image\nis one-third of the size of the object.\n\n+ 0.33\n\nExample 9.4\n\nA2.0 cm tall object is placed perpendicular to the principal axis ofa\nconvex lens of focal length 10 cm. The distance of the object from the\nlens is 15 cm. Find the nature, position and size of the image. Also\nfind its magnification.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nSolution\n\nHeight of the objecth = +2.0cm;\n\nFocal length f = +10cm;\n\nobject-distance u = -15cm;\n=?\n\nImage-distance v\nHeight of the image h’ = ?\n\n— 2 tid\nSince D uf\n\ndiv\nor, vou S\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n= + = +\nv (-15) 10 15 10\n\n1_-2+3 = 1\n\nv 30 30\nor, v=+ 30cm\nThe positive sign of v shows that the image is formed at a distance of\n30 cm on the other side of the optical centre. The image is real and\ninverted.\n\nMagnification m= M2\ngnificati en\n\nor, h’ =h(v/u)\nHeight of the image, h’ = (2.0) (+30/-15) =- 4.0 cm\nMagnification m= v/u\n\nThe negative signs of m and h’ show that the image is inverted and\nreal. It is formed below the principal axis. Thus, a real, inverted image,\n4 cm tall, is formed at a distance of 30 cm on the other side of the\nlens. The image is two times enlarged.\n\n9.3.8 Power of a Lens\n\nYou have already learnt that the ability of a lens to converge or diverge\nlight rays depends on its focal length. For example, a convex lens of\nshort focal length bends the light rays through large angles, by focussing\nthem closer to the optical centre. Similarly, concave lens of very short\nfocal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal\nlength. The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved\nby a lens is expressed in terms of its power. The power ofa lens is defined\nas the reciprocal of its focal length. It is represented by the letter P. The\npower P of a lens of focal length fis given by\n\nP= (9:11)\n\nLight — Reflection and Refraction\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n157\n\n\nThe SI unit of power ofa lens is ‘dioptre’. It is denoted by the letter D.\nIf fis expressed in metres, then, power is expressed in dioptres. Thus,\n1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre. 1D = lm\".\nYou may note that the power of a convex lens is positive and that of a\nconcave lens is negative.\n\nOpticians prescribe corrective lenses indicating their powers. Let us\nsay the lens prescribed has power equal to + 2.0 D. This means the lens\nprescribed is convex. The focal length of the lens is + 0.50 m. Similarly,\na lens of power —- 2.5 D has a focal length of- 0.40 m. The lens is concave.\n\n@ @ @® @ @® @ @® @® ® ®\n\nMore to Know!\n\nQUESTION S\n\nDefine 1 dioptre of power of a lens.\n\nA convex lens forms a real and inverted image of a needle at a distance\nof 50 cm from it. Whereis the needle placed in front of the convex lens\nif the image is equal to the size of the object? Also, find the power of the\nlens.\n\nFind the power of a concave lens of focal length 2 m.\n\nWhat you have learnt\n\nLight seems to travel in straight lines.\n\nMirrors and lenses form images of objects. Images can be either real or virtual,\ndepending on the position of the object.\n\nThe reflecting surfaces, of all types, obey the laws of reflection.

A light ray bends towards the normal when it travels obliquely\nfrom a rarer to a denser medium.\n\nLight travels in vacuum with an enormous speed of 3x10% ms. The speed of light\nis different in different media.\n\nThe refractive index of a transparent medium is the ratio of the speed of light in\nvacuum to that in the medium.\n\nIn case of a rectangular glass slab, the refraction takes place at both air-glass\ninterface and glass-air interface. The emergent ray is parallel to the direction of\nincident ray.\n\na\nf° gives the relationship between the object-distance (u),\n\nimage-distance (v), and the focal length (f) of a spherical lens.\n\nPower of a lens is the reciprocal of its focal length.

On lighting up the room,\nthings become visible. What makes things visible? During the day, the\nsunlight helps us to see objects. An object reflects light that falls on it.\nThis reflected light, when received by our eyes, enables us to see things.\nWe are able to see through a transparent medium as light is transmitted\nthrough it. There are a number of common wonderful phenomena\nassociated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling\nof stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a medium\nand so on. A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them.\nBy observing the common optical phenomena around us, we may\nconclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact that a small\nsource of light casts a sharp shadow of an opaque object points to this\nstraight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light.\n\nIn this Chapter, we shall study the phenomena of reflection and\nrefraction of light using the straight-line propagation of light. These basic\nconcepts will help us in the study of some of the optical phenomena in\nnature. We shall try to understand in this Chapter the reflection of light\nby spherical mirrors and refraction of light and their application in real\nlife situations.\n\n9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT\n\nA highly polished surface, such as a mirror, reflects most of the light\nfalling on it.

You are familiar with the formation of image\nby a plane mirror. What are the properties of the image? Image formed\nby a plane mirror is always virtual and erect. The size of the image is\nequal to that of the object. The image formed is as far behind the mirror\nas the object is in front of it. Further, the image is laterally inverted.\nHow would the images be when the reflecting surfaces are curved? Let\nus explore.\n\n= Take a large shining spoon.

The most commonly used type of curved mirror is the spherical\nmirror. The reflecting surface of such mirrors can be considered to form\na part of the surface of a sphere. Such mirrors, whose reflecting surfaces\nare spherical, are called spherical mirrors. We shall now study about\nspherical mirrors in some detail.\n\n9.2 SPHERICAL MIRRORS\n\nThe reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or\noutwards. Aspherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards,\nthat is, faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror.\nA spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called\na convex mirror. The schematic representation of these mirrors is shown\nin Fig. 9.1. You may note in these diagrams that the back\nof the mirror is shaded.\n\nYou may now understand that the surface of the spoon\ncurved inwards can be approximated to a concave mirror\nand the surface of the spoon bulged outwards can be\napproximated to a convex mirror.\n\nBefore we move further on spherical mirrors, we need to\nrecognise and understand the meaning of a few terms.

This point is called the centre of curvature of\nthe spherical mirror. It is represented by the letter C. Please note that the\ncentre of curvature is not a part of the mirror. It lies outside its reflecting\nsurface. The centre of curvature of a concave mirror lies in front of it.\nHowever, it lies behind the mirror in case of a convex mirror. You may\nnote this in Fig.9.2 (a) and (b). The radius of the sphere of which the\nreflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radius\nof curvature of the mirror. It is represented by the letter R. You may note\nthat the distance PC is equal to the radius of curvature. Imagine a straight\nline passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical\nmirror. This line is called the principal axis.

For spherical mirrors of small apertures,\nthe radius of curvature is found to be equal to twice the focal length. We\nput this as R= 2f.

An infinite number of rays originate from each\nof these points. To construct the ray diagrams, in order to locate the\nimage of an object, an arbitrarily large number of rays emanating froma\npoint could be considered.

Let us study about refractive index in some detail.\n\n9.3.2 The Refractive Index\n\nYou have already studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely from\none transparent medium into another will change its direction in the\nsecond medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place\nin a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,\nthe “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).\n\nThe refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,\nthe relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns\nout that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light\ntravels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3x10 ms\"!. In air, the speed of\nlight is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces\nconsiderably in glass or water. The value of the refractive index for a\ngiven pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as\ngiven below.\n\nConsider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as\nshown in Fig.9.11. Let v, be the speed of light in medium 1 and v, be the\nspeed of light in medium 2. The refractive index of medium 2 with respect\nto medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and\nthe speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol\nn,,- This can be expressed in an equation form as\n\nMedium 1 Speed of light in medium 1 __iv,\n(Ain) n,,= a = (9.5)\nSpeed of light in medium 2 _ v,\n(Ges By the same argument, the refractive index of medium\n1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n.,,.

Have you ever touched the surface of a magnifying glass\nwith your hand? Is it plane surface or curved? Is it thicker in the middle\nor at the edges? The glasses used in spectacles and that by a watchmaker\nare examples of lenses. What is a lens? How does it bend light rays? We\nshall discuss these in this section.\n\nA transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both\nsurfaces are spherical, forms a lens. This means\nthat a lens is bound by at least one spherical\nsurface. In such lenses, the other surface would\nbe plane. A lens may have two spherical\nsurfaces, bulging outwards. Such a lens is called\na double convex lens. It is simply called a convex\nlens. It is thicker at the middle as compared to\nthe edges. Convex lens converges light rays as\nshown in Fig. 9.12 (a). Hence convex lenses are\nalso called converging lenses. Similarly, a double\nconcave lens is bounded by two spherical\nsurfaces, curved inwards. It is thicker at the\nedges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge\nlight rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lenses\nare also called diverging lenses. A double concave\nlens is simply called a concave lens.\n\nA lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens,\nhas two spherical surfaces. Each of these surfaces\nFi forms a part of a sphere.

The effective\ndiameter of the circular outline of a spherical lens is called its aperture.\nWe shall confine our discussion in this Chapter to such lenses whose\naperture is much less than its radius of curvature and the two centres of\ncurvatures are equidistant from the optical centre O. Such lenses are\ncalled thin lenses with small apertures. What happens when parallel rays\nof light are incident on a lens? Let us do an Activity to understand this.\n\nCAUTION: Do not look at the Sun directly or through a lens while\ndoing this Activity or otherwise. You may damage your eyes if you\ndo so.\n\n= Hold a convex lens in your hand. Direct it towards the Sun.\n\n= Focus the light from the Sun on a sheet of paper. Obtain a sharp\nbright image of the Sun.\n\n= Hold the paper and the lens in the same position for a while. Keep\nobserving the paper. What happened? Why? Recall your experience\nin Activity 9.2.\n\nThe paper begins to burn producing smoke. It may even catch fire\nafter a while. Why does this happen? The light from the Sun constitutes\nparallel rays of light. These rays were converged by the lens at the sharp\nbright spot formed on the paper. In fact, the bright spot you got on the\npaper is a real image of the Sun. The concentration of the sunlight at a\npoint generated heat. This caused the paper to burn.\n\nNow, we shall consider rays of light parallel to the principal axis ofa\nlens. What happens when you pass such rays of light through a lens?\nThis is illustrated for a convex lens in Fig.9.12 (a) and for a concave lens\nin Fig.9.12 (b).\n\nObserve Fig.9.12 (a) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a convex lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are converging to a point on the principal axis. This point\non the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. Let us see\nnow the action of a concave lens.\n\nObserve Fig.9.12 (b) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a concave lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are appearing to diverge from a point on the principal\naxis. This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the\nconcave lens.\n\nIf you pass parallel rays from the opposite surface of the lens, you\nget another principal focus on the opposite side. Letter F is usually used\nto represent principal focus. However, a lens has two principal foci. They\nare represented by F, and F,. The distance of the principal focus from\nthe optical centre of a lens is called its focal length. The letter f is used to\nrepresent the focal length. How can you find the focal length of a convex\nlens? Recall the Activity 9.11. In this Activity, the distance between the\nposition of the lens and the position of the image of the Sun gives the\napproximate focal length of the lens.\n\nLight — Reflection and Refraction\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n151\n",

For example, a convex lens of\nshort focal length bends the light rays through large angles, by focussing\nthem closer to the optical centre. Similarly, concave lens of very short\nfocal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal\nlength. The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved\nby a lens is expressed in terms of its power. The power ofa lens is defined\nas the reciprocal of its focal length.

You also studied the nature, position and relative size of\nimages formed by lenses. How can these ideas help us in the study of\nthe human eye? The human eye uses light and enables us to see objects\naround us. It has a lens in its structure. What is the function of the lens\nin a human eye? How do the lenses used in spectacles correct defects of\nvision? Let us consider these questions in this chapter.\n\nWe have learnt in the previous chapter about light and some of its\nproperties. In this chapter, we shall use these ideas to study some of the\noptical phenomena in nature. We shall also discuss about rainbow\nformation, splitting of white light and blue colour of the sky.\n\n10.1 THE HUMAN EYE\n\nThe human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs.\nIt enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On\nclosing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell,\ntaste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however, impossible to identify\ncolours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human\neye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful,\ncolourful world around us.\n\nThe human eye is like a camera. Its lens\nsystem forms an image on a light-sensitive\nscreen called the retina. Light enters the eye Crystalline lens\nthrough a thin membrane called the cornea. Aqueous\nIt forms the transparent bulge on the front humour\nsurface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1. — Pupil\nThe eyeball is approximately sphericalinshape 's\nwith a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the\nrefraction for the light rays entering the eye\noccurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The ~~\ncrystalline lens merely provides the finer S ;\nadjustment of focal length required to focus\nobjects at different distances on the retina. We find a structure called iris\nbehind the cornea. Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the\nsize of the pupil. The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n1064CH11\n\nRetina\n\nOptic nerve\n\nVitreous humour\n\nFigure 10.1\nThe human eye\n\n\n162\n\nentering the eye. The eye lens forms an inverted real image of the object\non the retina. The retina is a delicate membrane having enormous\nnumber of light-sensitive cells. The light-sensitive cells get activated\nupon illumination and generate electrical signals. These signals are\nsent to the brain via the optic nerves. The brain interprets these signals,\nand finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects as\nthey are.\n\n10.1.1 Power of Accommodation\n\nThe eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature\ncan be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the\ncurvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the\nmuscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length\nincreases. This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are\nlooking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This\nincreases the curvature of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker.\nConsequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases. This enables\nus to see nearby objects clearly.\n\nThe ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called\naccommodation. However, the focal length of the eye lens cannot be\ndecreased below a certain minimum limit. Try to read a printed page by\nholding it very close to your eyes. You may see the image being blurred\nor feel strain in the eye. To see an object comfortably and distinctly, you\nmust hold it at about 25 cm from the eyes. The minimum distance, at\nwhich objects can be seen most distinctly without strain, is called the\nleast distance of distinct vision. It is also called the near point of the eye.\nFor a young adult with normal vision, the near point is about\n25 cm. The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is\ncalled the far point of the eye. It is infinity for a normal eye. You may note\nhere a normal eye can see objects clearly that are between 25 cm and\ninfinity.\n\nSometimes, the crystalline lens of people at old age becomes milky and\ncloudy. This condition is called cataract. This causes partial or complete\nloss of vision. It is possible to restore vision through a cataract surgery.\n\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\n\nSometimes, the eye may gradually lose its power of accommodation.\nIn such conditions, the person cannot see the objects distinctly and\ncomfortably. The vision becomes blurred due to the refractive defects\nof the eye.\n\nThere are mainly three common refractive defects of vision. These\nare (i) myopia or near-sightedness, (ii) Hypermetropia or far-\nsightedness, and (iii) Presbyopia. These defects can be corrected by\nthe use of suitable spherical lenses. We discuss below these defects\nand their correction.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n(a) Myopia\n\nMyopia is also known as near-\nsightedness. A person with myopia\ncan see nearby objects clearly but\ncannot see distant objects distinctly.\nA person with this defect has the far\npoint nearer than infinity. Such a\nperson may see clearly upto a\ndistance of a few metres. In a myopic\neye, the image of a distant object is\nformed in front of the retina [Fig.\n10.2 (b)] and not at the retina itself.\nThis defect may arise due to (i)\nexcessive curvature of the eye lens,\nor (ii) elongation of the eyeball. This\ndefect can be corrected by using a\nconcave lens of suitable power. This\nis illustrated in Fig. 10.2 (c). A\nconcave lens of suitable power will\n\n(a) Far point of a myopic eye\n\n(b) Myopic Eye\n\n(c) Correction for myopia\n\nFigure 10.2\n(a), (b) The myopic eye, and (c) correction for myopia witha\nconcave lens\n\nbring the image back on to the\n\nretina and thus the defect is corrected.\nHypermetropia\n\nHypermetropia is also known as far-sightedness.\nA person with hypermetropia can see distant\nobjects clearly but cannot see nearby objects\ndistinctly. The near point, for the person, is farther\naway from the normal near point (25 cm). Sucha\nperson has to keep a reading material much\nbeyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable\nreading. This is because the light rays from a\ncloseby object are focussed at a point behind the\nretina as shown in Fig. 10.3 (b). This defect arises\neither because (i) the focal length of the eye lens is\ntoo long, or (ii) the eyeball has become too small.\nThis defect can be corrected by using a convex\nlens of appropriate power. This is illustrated in\nFig. 10.3 (c). Eye-glasses with converging lenses\nprovide the additional focussing power required\nfor forming the image on the retina.\n\nPresbyopia\nThe power of accommodation of the eye usually\ndecreases with ageing. For most people, the near\npoint gradually recedes away. They find it difficult\nto see nearby objects comfortably and distinctly\nwithout corrective eye-glasses. This defect is\ncalled Presbyopia. It arises due to the gradual\n\nThe Human Eye and the Colourful World\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nN N’\n\n(a) Near point of a Hypermetropic eye\n\nN N\n\n(b) Hypermetropic eye\n\n(c) Correction for Hypermetropic eye\n\nFigure 10.3\n(a), (b) The hypermetropic eye, and (c)\ncorrection for hypermetropia\n\nN = Near point ofa\n\nhypermetropic eye.\n\nN’ = Near point of a\n\nnormal eye.\n\n163\n\n\nweakening of the ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of the\neye lens. Sometimes, a person may suffer from both myopia and\nhypermetropia. Such people often require bi-focal lenses. A common\ntype of bi-focal lenses consists of both concave and convex lenses.\nThe upper portion consists of a concave lens. It facilitates distant\nvision. The lower part is a convex lens. It facilitates near vision.\n\nThese days, it is possible to correct the refractive defects with\ncontact lenses or through surgical interventions.\n\nQ U ES TION S$\n\nWhat is meant by power of accommodation of the eye?\n\nA person with a myopic eye cannot see objects beyond 1.2 m distinctly.\nWhat should be the type of the corrective lens used to restore proper\nvision?\n\nWhat is the far point and near point of the human eye with normal\nvision?\n\nA student has difficulty reading the blackboard while sitting in the last\nrow.

CIBBER\nDo you know that our eyes can live even after our death? By donating our eyes after we\ndie, we can light the life of a blind person.\nAbout 35 million people in the developing world are blind and most of them can be\ncured. About 4.5 million people with corneal blindness can be cured through corneal\ntransplantation of donated eyes. Out of these 4.5 million, 60% are children below the\nage of 12. So, if we have got the gift of vision, why not pass it on to somebody who does\nnot have it? What do we have to keep in mind when eyes have to be donated?\n\n= Eye donors can belong to any age group or sex. People who use spectacles, or those\noperated for cataract, can still donate the eyes. People who are diabetic, have\nhypertension, asthma patients and those without communicable diseases can also\ndonate eyes.\n\n164 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n10.3 REFRACTION OF LIGHT THROUGH A PRISM\n\nYou have learnt how light gets refracted through a rectangular glass\nslab. For parallel refracting surfaces, as in a glass slab, the emergent ray\nis parallel to the incident ray. However, it is slightly displaced laterally.\nHow would light get refracted through a transparent prism? Consider a\ntriangular glass prism. It has two triangular bases and three rectangular\nlateral surfaces. These surfaces are inclined to each other. The angle\nbetween its two lateral faces is called the angle of the prism. Let us now\ndo an activity to study the refraction of light through a triangular glass\nprism.\n\n= Fix a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using drawing pins.\nPlace a glass prism on it in such a way that it rests on its triangular\nbase. Trace the outline of the prism using a pencil.\n\n= Draw a straight line PE inclined to one of the refracting surfaces,\nsay AB, of the prism.\n\n= Fix two pins, say at points P and Q, on the line PE as shown in\nFig. 10.4.\n\n= Look for the images of the pins, fixed at P and Q, through the\nother face AC.\n\n= Fix two more pins, at points R and S, such that the pins at R and\nS and the images of the pins at P and Q lie on the same straight\nline.\nRemove the pins and the glass prism.\n\n= The line PE meets the boundary of the prism at point E\n(see Fig. 10.4). Similarly, join and produce the points Rand S. Let\nthese lines meet the boundary of the prism at E and F, respectively.\nJoin E and F.\n\n= Draw perpendiculars to the refracting surfaces AB and AC of the\nprism at points E and F, respectively.\n\n= Mark the angle of incidence (Zi), the angle of refraction (Zr) and\nthe angle of emergence (Ze) as shown in Fig. 10.4.\n\nThe Human Eye and the Colourful World\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n165\n\n\n166\n\nPE — Incident ray Zi — Angle of incidence\n\nEF — Refracted ray Zr — Angle of refraction\nFS — Emergent ray Ze — Angle of emergence\nZA — Angle of the prism ZD — Angle of deviation\n\nFigure 10.4 Refraction of light through a triangular glass prism\n\nHere PE is the incident ray, EF is the refracted ray and FS is the\nemergent ray. You may note that a ray of light is entering from air to\nglass at the first surface AB. The light ray on refraction has bent towards\nthe normal. At the second surface AC, the light ray has entered from\nglass to air. Hence it has bent away from normal. Compare the angle of\nincidence and the angle of refraction at each refracting surface of the\nprism. Is this similar to the kind of bending that occurs in a glass slab?\nThe peculiar shape of the prism makes the emergent ray bend at an\nangle to the direction of the incident ray. This angle is called the angle of\ndeviation. In this case ZD is the angle of deviation. Mark the angle of\ndeviation in the above activity and measure it.\n\n10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GLASS PRISM\n\nYou must have seen and appreciated the spectacular colours in a rainbow.\nHow could the white light of the Sun give us various colours of the\nrainbow? Before we take up this question, we shall first go back to the\nrefraction of light through a prism. The inclined refracting surfaces of a\nglass prism show exciting phenomenon. Let us find it out through an\nactivity.\n\n= Take a thick sheet of cardboard and make a small hole or narrow\nslit in its middle.\n\n= Allow sunlight to fall on the narrow slit. This gives a narrow beam\nof white light.\n\n= Now, take a glass prism and allow the light from the slit to fall on\none of its faces as shown in Fig. 10.5.\n\n= Turn the prism slowly until the light that comes out of it appears\non a nearby screen.\n\n= What do you observe? You will find a beautiful band of colours.\nWhy does this happen?\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nThe prism has probably split the incident\nwhite light into a band of colours. Note the\ncolours that appear at the two ends of the\ncolour band. What is the sequence of colours\nthat you see on the screen? The various\ncolours seen are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green,\nYellow, Orange and Red, as shown in\nFig. 10.5. The acronym VIBGYOR will help ts lsht\nyou to remember the sequence of colours.\n\nThe band of the coloured components of a\n\nGlass prism\n\nlight beam is called its spectrum. You might Figure 10.5 Dispersion of white light by the glass prism\n\nnot be able to see all the colours separately.\n\nYet something makes each colour distinct from the other. The splitting\n\nof light into its component colours is called dispersion.\n\nYou have seen that white light is dispersed\ninto its seven-colour components by a prism.\nWhy do we get these colours? Different colours\nof light bend through different angles with\nrespect to the incident ray, as they pass\nthrough a prism. The red light bends the least\nwhile the violet the most. Thus the rays of each\n\nScreen\n\ncolour emerge along different paths andthus Figure 10.6 Recombination of the spectrum of\n\nbecome distinct. It is the band of distinct\ncolours that we see in a spectrum.\n\nIsaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain\nthe spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of\nthe spectrum of white light further by using another similar\nprism. However, he could not get any more colours. He\nthen placed a second identical prism in an inverted position\nwith respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This\nallowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through\nthe second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging\nfrom the other side of the second prism. This observation\ngave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven\ncolours.\n\nAny light that gives a spectrum similar to that of\nsunlight is often referred to as white light.\n\nArainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky\nafter a rain shower (Fig. 10.7). It is caused by dispersion\nof sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the\natmosphere. A rainbow is always formed in a direction\nopposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets act like\nsmall prisms. They refract and disperse the incident\nsunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it\nagain when it comes out of the raindrop (Fig. 10.8). Due\nto the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different\ncolours reach the observer's eye.\n\nYou can also see a rainbow on a sunny day when\nyou look at the sky through a waterfall or through a water\nfountain, with the Sun behind you.\n\nThe Human Eye and the Colourful World\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nwhite light\n\nFigure 10.7 Rainbow in the sky\n\nRaindrop\n\nSunlight\n\nFigure 10.8 Rainbow formation\n\n167\n\n\napparent 10.5 ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION\n\nStar *, star position\n\nRefractive index\nincreasing\n\nFigure 10.9\nApparent star position\ndue to atmospheric\nrefraction\n\nYou might have observed the apparent random wavering or\nflickering of objects seen through a turbulent stream of hot air\nrising above a fire or a radiator. The air just above the fire becomes\nhotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense)\nthan the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly\nless than that of the cooler air. Since the physical conditions of\nthe refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparent\nposition of the object, as seen through the hot air, fluctuates.\nThis wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction\nof light by the earth’s atmosphere) on a small scale in our local\nenvironment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on\na much larger scale. Let us see how we can explain it.\n\nTwinkling of stars\nThe twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The\nstarlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction\ncontinuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction\noccurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the\natmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position\nof the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears\nslightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the\nhorizon (Fig. 10.9). Further, this apparent position of the star is not\nstationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions\nof the earth’s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the\nprevious paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate\npoint-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from\nthe star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star\nfluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers — the\nstar sometimes appears brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which\nis the twinkling effect.\n\nWhy don’t the planets twinkle? The planets are much\n\nAppaEEAr BDEIKION Ly closer to the earth, and are thus seen as extended sources.\noftheSun = c 3 If we consider a planet as a collection of a large number\n\n-\n\nObserver 27:\n\n’\n\nAtmosphere\n\nFigure 10.10\nAtmospheric refraction\neffects at sunrise and\nsunset\n\n168\n\n“7 “of point-sized sources of light, the total variation in the\namount of light entering our eye from all the individual\n\na Horizon point-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby\nf - yi nullifying the twinkling effect.\n\nAdvance sunrise and delayed sunset\n\nThe Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual\nsunrise, and about 2 minutes after the actual sunset\nbecause of atmospheric refraction. By actual sunrise, we\nmean the actual crossing of the horizon by the Sun. Fig.\n10.10 shows the actual and apparent positions of the\nSun with respect to the horizon. The time difference\nbetween actual sunset and the apparent sunset is about\n2 minutes. The apparent flattening of the Sun’s disc at\nsunrise and sunset is also due to the same phenomenon.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n10.6 SCATTERING OF LIGHT\n\nThe interplay of light with objects around us gives rise to several\nspectacular phenomena in nature. The blue colour of the sky, colour of\nwater in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset\nare some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous\nclass, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles.\nThe path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible.\nHowever, its path becomes visible through a colloidal solution where the\nsize of the particles is relatively larger.\n\n10.6.1 Tyndall Effect\n\nThe earth’s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles.\nThese particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles\nof dust and molecules of air. When a beam of light strikes such fine\nparticles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us,\nafter being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of\nscattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect\nwhich you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a\nfine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole.\nThus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can\nalso be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense\nforest. Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light.\n\nThe colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering\nparticles. Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of\nlarger size scatter light of longer wavelengths. Ifthe size of the scattering\nparticles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear\nwhite.\n\n10.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue?\n\nThe molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size\nsmaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in\nscattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer\nwavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8\ntimes greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the\natmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter\nwavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters\nour eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been\nany scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark. The sky appears\ndark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not\nprominent at such heights.\n\nYou might have observed that ‘danger’ signal lights are red in colour.\nDo you know why? The red is least scattered by fog or smoke. Therefore,\nit can be seen in the same colour at a distance.\n\nThe Human Eye and the Colourful World\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n169\n\n\nWhat you have learnt\n\nThe ability of the eye to focus on both near and distant objects, by adjusting its\nfocal length, is called the accommodation of the eye.\n\nThe smallest distance, at which the eye can see objects clearly without strain, is\ncalled the near point of the eye or the least distance of distinct vision. For a young\nadult with normal vision, it is about 25 cm.\n\nThe common refractive defects of vision include myopia, hypermetropia and\npresbyopia. Myopia (short-sightedness — the image of distant objects is focussed\nbefore the retina) is corrected by using a concave lens of suitable power.\nHypermetropia (far-sightedness — the image of nearby objects is focussed beyond\nthe retina) is corrected by using a convex lens of suitable power. The eye loses its\npower of accommodation at old age.\n\nThe splitting of white light into its component colours is called dispersion.\nScattering of light causes the blue colour of sky.\n\nEXERCISE S\n\n. The human eye can focus on objects at different distances by adjusting the focal\nlength of the eye lens. This is due to\n(a) presbyopia. (b) accommodation.\n(c) near-sightedness. (d) far-sightedness.\n\n. The human eye forms the image of an object at its\n(a) cornea. (b) iris. (c) pupil. (d) retina.\n\n.

The human eye uses light and enables us to see objects\naround us. It has a lens in its structure. What is the function of the lens\nin a human eye? How do the lenses used in spectacles correct defects of\nvision? Let us consider these questions in this chapter.\n\nWe have learnt in the previous chapter about light and some of its\nproperties. In this chapter, we shall use these ideas to study some of the\noptical phenomena in nature. We shall also discuss about rainbow\nformation, splitting of white light and blue colour of the sky.\n\n10.1 THE HUMAN EYE\n\nThe human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs.\nIt enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On\nclosing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell,\ntaste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however, impossible to identify\ncolours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human\neye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful,\ncolourful world around us.\n\nThe human eye is like a camera. Its lens\nsystem forms an image on a light-sensitive\nscreen called the retina. Light enters the eye Crystalline lens\nthrough a thin membrane called the cornea. Aqueous\nIt forms the transparent bulge on the front humour\nsurface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1. — Pupil\nThe eyeball is approximately sphericalinshape 's\nwith a diameter of about 2.3 cm.

The ~~\ncrystalline lens merely provides the finer S ;\nadjustment of focal length required to focus\nobjects at different distances on the retina. We find a structure called iris\nbehind the cornea.

The light-sensitive cells get activated\nupon illumination and generate electrical signals. These signals are\nsent to the brain via the optic nerves. The brain interprets these signals,\nand finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects as\nthey are.\n\n10.1.1 Power of Accommodation\n\nThe eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature\ncan be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the\ncurvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the\nmuscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length\nincreases. This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are\nlooking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This\nincreases the curvature of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker.\nConsequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases. This enables\nus to see nearby objects clearly.\n\nThe ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called\naccommodation. However, the focal length of the eye lens cannot be\ndecreased below a certain minimum limit. Try to read a printed page by\nholding it very close to your eyes. You may see the image being blurred\nor feel strain in the eye. To see an object comfortably and distinctly, you\nmust hold it at about 25 cm from the eyes. The minimum distance, at\nwhich objects can be seen most distinctly without strain, is called the\nleast distance of distinct vision. It is also called the near point of the eye.\nFor a young adult with normal vision, the near point is about\n25 cm. The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is\ncalled the far point of the eye. It is infinity for a normal eye. You may note\nhere a normal eye can see objects clearly that are between 25 cm and\ninfinity.\n\nSometimes, the crystalline lens of people at old age becomes milky and\ncloudy. This condition is called cataract. This causes partial or complete\nloss of vision. It is possible to restore vision through a cataract surgery.\n\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\n\nSometimes, the eye may gradually lose its power of accommodation.\nIn such conditions, the person cannot see the objects distinctly and\ncomfortably. The vision becomes blurred due to the refractive defects\nof the eye.\n\nThere are mainly three common refractive defects of vision. These\nare (i) myopia or near-sightedness, (ii) Hypermetropia or far-\nsightedness, and (iii) Presbyopia. These defects can be corrected by\nthe use of suitable spherical lenses.

You might Figure 10.5 Dispersion of white light by the glass prism\n\nnot be able to see all the colours separately.\n\nYet something makes each colour distinct from the other. The splitting\n\nof light into its component colours is called dispersion.\n\nYou have seen that white light is dispersed\ninto its seven-colour components by a prism.\nWhy do we get these colours?

He\nthen placed a second identical prism in an inverted position\nwith respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6.

The air just above the fire becomes\nhotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense)\nthan the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly\nless than that of the cooler air. Since the physical conditions of\nthe refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparent\nposition of the object, as seen through the hot air, fluctuates.\nThis wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction\nof light by the earth’s atmosphere) on a small scale in our local\nenvironment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on\na much larger scale. Let us see how we can explain it.\n\nTwinkling of stars\nThe twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The\nstarlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction\ncontinuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction\noccurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the\natmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position\nof the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears\nslightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the\nhorizon (Fig. 10.9). Further, this apparent position of the star is not\nstationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions\nof the earth’s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the\nprevious paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate\npoint-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from\nthe star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star\nfluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers — the\nstar sometimes appears brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which\nis the twinkling effect.\n\nWhy don’t the planets twinkle?

The time difference\nbetween actual sunset and the apparent sunset is about\n2 minutes. The apparent flattening of the Sun’s disc at\nsunrise and sunset is also due to the same phenomenon.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

        "text": "10.6 SCATTERING OF LIGHT\n\nThe interplay of light with objects around us gives rise to several\nspectacular phenomena in nature. The blue colour of the sky, colour of\nwater in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset\nare some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous\nclass, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles.\nThe path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible.\nHowever, its path becomes visible through a colloidal solution where the\nsize of the particles is relatively larger.\n\n10.6.1 Tyndall Effect\n\nThe earth’s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles.\nThese particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles\nof dust and molecules of air. When a beam of light strikes such fine\nparticles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us,\nafter being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of\nscattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect\nwhich you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a\nfine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole.\nThus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can\nalso be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense\nforest. Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light.\n\nThe colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering\nparticles. Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of\nlarger size scatter light of longer wavelengths. Ifthe size of the scattering\nparticles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear\nwhite.\n\n10.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue?\n\nThe molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size\nsmaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in\nscattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer\nwavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8\ntimes greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the\natmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter\nwavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters\nour eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been\nany scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark. The sky appears\ndark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not\nprominent at such heights.\n\nYou might have observed that ‘danger’ signal lights are red in colour.\nDo you know why? The red is least scattered by fog or smoke. Therefore,\nit can be seen in the same colour at a distance.\n\nThe Human Eye and the Colourful World\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n169\n",

It is a controllable\n\nand convenient form of energy for a variety of uses in homes, schools,\nhospitals, industries and so on. What constitutes electricity? How does\nit flow in an electric circuit? What are the factors that control or regulate\nthe current through an electric circuit? In this Chapter, we shall attempt\nto answer such questions. We shall also discuss the heating effect of\nelectric current and its applications.\n\n11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT\n\nWe are familiar with air current and water current. We know that flowing\nwater constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge\nflows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we\nsay that there is an electric current in the conductor. In a torch, we\nknow that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide\nflow of charges or an electric current through the torch bulb to glow. We\nhave also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What\ndoes a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and\nthe bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an\nelectric circuit. Now, ifthe circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the\ntorch is turned off), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow.\n\nHow do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by\nthe amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In\nother words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using\nmetallic wires, electrons constitute the flow of charges. However, electrons\nwere not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first\nobserved. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive\ncharges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the\ndirection of electric current. Conventionally, in an electric circuit the\ndirection of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the\nflow of electrons, which are negative charges.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n1064CH12\n\n\nFigure 11.1\n\n{-_.+__&\n\nIf a net charge Q, flows across any cross-section of a conductor in\ntime t, then the current I, through the cross-section is\n\n1-2 (11.1)\nt\n\nThe SI unit of electric charge is coulomb (C), which is equivalent to\nthe charge contained in nearly 6 x 10!° electrons. (We know that an\nelectron possesses a negative charge of 1.6 x 10'9C.) The electric\ncurrent is expressed by a unit called ampere (A), named after the\nFrench scientist, Andre-Marie Ampere (1775-1836). One ampere is\nconstituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second, that is,\n1A=1C/1s. Small quantities of current are expressed in milliampere\n(1 mA = 10° A) or in microampere (1 tA = 10° A).\nAn instrument called ammeter measures electric\ncurrent in a circuit. It is always connected in series\nin a circuit through which the current is to be\nmeasured. Figure 11.1 shows the schematic\ndiagram of a typical electric circuit comprising a\ncell, an electric bulb, an ammeter and a plug key.\nNote that the electric current flows in the circuit\nfrom the positive terminal of the cell to the negative\nterminal of the cell through the bulb and ammeter.\n\nA schematic diagram of an electric circuit\ncomprising — cell, electric bulb, ammeter and\n\nplug key\n\nExample 11.1\n\nA current of 0.5 Ais drawn by a filament of an electric bulb for 10\nminutes.

Let us consider the analogy of\nflow of water. Charges do not flow in a copper wire by themselves, just as\nwater in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube\nis connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a\npressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of\nthe other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic\nwire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only\nif there is a difference of electric pressure - called the potential difference —\nalong the conductor. This difference of potential may be produced by a\nbattery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within\na cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell,\neven when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a\nconducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in\nmotion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to\nmaintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its\nchemical energy stored in it.\n\nWe define the electric potential difference between two points in an\nelectric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit\ncharge from one point to the other -\n\nPotential difference (V) between two points = Work done (W)/Charge (Q)\n\nV = w/Q (91.2)\n\nThe SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after\nAlessandro Volta (1745-1827), an Italian physicist. One volt is the\npotential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor\nwhen 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one\npoint to the other.\n\n1 joule\nTherefore, 1 volt = ———___—\n1 coulomb\n(11.3)\n1V =1lJC!\n\nThe potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called\nthe voltmeter. The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the\npoints between which the potential difference is to be measured.\n\nExample 11.2\nHow much work is done in moving a charge of 2 C across two points\nhaving a potential difference 12 V?\n\nSolution\n\nThe amount of charge Q, that flows between two points at potential\ndifference V (= 12 V) is 2 C. Thus, the amount of work W, done in\nmoving the charge [from Eq. (11.2)] is\n\nElectricity\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n173\n\n\nW = 40)\n12Vx2C\n24 J.\n\nName a device that helps to maintain a potential difference across a\nconductor.\n\nWhat is meant by saying that the potential difference between two points\nis 1 V?\n\nHow much energy is given to each coulomb of charge passing through a\n6 V battery?\n\n11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM\n\nWe know that an electric circuit, as shown in Fig. 11.1, comprises a cell\n(or a battery), a plug key, electrical component(s), and connecting wires.\nIt is often convenient to draw a schematic diagram, in which different\ncomponents of the circuit are represented by the symbols conveniently\nused.

Let us explore with an Activity.\n\nSet up a circuit as shown in Fig. 11.2,\nconsisting of a nichrome wire XY of length,\nsay 0.5 m, an ammeter, a voltmeter and\nfour cells of 1.5 V each. (Nichrome is an\nalloy of nickel, chromium, manganese, and\niron metals.)\n\nFirst use only one cell as the source in the\ncircuit. Note the reading in the ammeter I,\nfor the current and reading of the voltmeter\nV for the potential difference across the\nnichrome wire XY in the circuit. Tabulate\nthem in the Table given.\n\nNext connect two cells in the circuit and\nnote the respective readings of the ammeter and voltmeter for the values of current through\nthe nichrome wire and potential difference across the nichrome wire.\n\nRepeat the above steps using three cells and then four cells in the circuit separately.\nCalculate the ratio of V to I for each pair of potential difference V and current I.\n\nFigure 11.2 Electric circuit for studying Ohm’s law\n\nNumber of cells | Current through Potential difference V/I\nused in the the nichrome across the (volt/ampere)\ncircuit wire, I nichrome\n(ampere) wire, V (volt)\n\nPlot a graph between V and I, and observe the nature of the graph.\n\nElectricity 175\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\neS a a S\n00 iS 2) i)\n\nPotential difference (V) ——>\no\niS\n\nIn this Activity, you will find that approximately the\nsame value for V/I is obtained in each case. Thus the V-I\ngraph is a straight line that passes through the origin of\nthe graph, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, V/Iis a constant\nratio.\n\nIn 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm\n(1787-1854) found out the relationship between the current\nI, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference\nacross its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the\nends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly\nproportional to the current flowing through it, provided its\n\n° ee ( —- o-6 temperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law. In\nother words —\nFigure 11.3\nV-I graph for a nichrome wire. A Vel (11.4)\nstraight line plot shows that as the or V/I = constant\ncurrent through a wire increases, the = R\npotential difference across the wire or V = JR (11.5)\n\nincreases linearly — this is Ohm’s law.\n\nIn Eq. (11.4), Ris a constant for the given metallic wire\n\nat a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the\n\nproperty of a conductor to resist the flow of charges through it. Its SI\nunit is ohm, represented by the Greek letter Q. According to Ohm’s law,\n\nR=V/I (11.6)\n\nIf the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V\nand the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor\n\n1 volt\n\nis 1 Q. Thatis, 1 ohm = ———\n1 ampere\n\nAlso from Eq. (11.5) we get\n\nI=V/R (11.7)\n\nIt is obvious from Eq. (11.7) that the current through a resistor is\ninversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the\ncurrent gets halved. In many practical cases it is necessary to increase\nor decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to\nregulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable\nresistance. In an electric circuit, a device called rheostat is often used to\nchange the resistance in the circuit. We will now study about electrical\nresistance of a conductor with the help of following Activity.\n\n= Take a nichrome wire, a torch bulb, a 10 W bulb and an ammeter (0 - 5 A range), a plug\n\nkey and some connecting wires.\n\n= Set up the circuit by connecting four dry cells of 1.5 V each in series with the ammeter\n\n176\n\nleaving a gap XY in the circuit, as shown in Fig. 11.4.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nea\n\n10 W bulb\n\n2\n\nTorch bulb\n\nNichrome wire\n\nHHH)\n\nFigure 11.4\n\n= Complete the circuit by connecting the nichrome wire in the gap XY. Plug the key. Note\ndown the ammeter reading. Take out the key from the plug. [Note: Always take out the key\nfrom the plug after measuring the current through the circuit.]\n\n= Replace the nichrome wire with the torch bulb in the circuit and find the current through\nit by measuring the reading of the ammeter.\n\n= Now repeat the above step with the 10 W bulb in the gap XY.\n\n= Are the ammeter readings different for different components connected in the gap XY?\nWhat do the above observations indicate?\n\n= You may repeat this Activity by keeping any material component in the gap. Observe the\nammeter readings in each case. Analyse the observations.\n\nIn this Activity we observe that the current is different for different\ncomponents. Why do they differ? Certain components offer an easy path\nfor the flow of electric current while the others resist the flow. We know\nthat motion of electrons in an electric circuit constitutes an electric\ncurrent. The electrons, however, are not completely free to move within a\nconductor. They are restrained by the attraction of the atoms among\nwhich they move. Thus, motion of electrons through a conductor is\nretarded by its resistance. A component of a given size that offers a low\nresistance is a good conductor. A conductor having some appreciable\nresistance is called a resistor. A component of identical size that offers a\nhigher resistance is a poor conductor. An insulator of the same size offers\neven higher resistance.\n\n11.5 FACTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTANCE OF A\nCONDUCTOR DEPENDS\n\n= Complete an electric circuit consisting of a cell, an ammeter, a nichrome wire of length l\n[say, marked (1)] and a plug key, as shown in Fig. 11.5.\n\nElectricity 177\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nFigure 11.5 Electric circuit to study the factors on which the resistance of conducting wires depends\n\n178\n\nNow, plug the key. Note the current in the ammeter.\n\nReplace the nichrome wire by another nichrome wire of same thickness but twice the\nlength, that is 21 [marked (2) in the Fig. 11.5].\n\nNote the ammeter reading.\n\nNow replace the wire by a thicker nichrome wire, of the same length lI [marked (3)]. A\nthicker wire has a larger cross-sectional area. Again note down the current through the\ncircuit.\n\nInstead of taking a nichrome wire, connect a copper wire [marked (4) in Fig. 11.5] in the\ncircuit. Let the wire be of the same length and same area of cross-section as that of the\nfirst nichrome wire [marked (1)]. Note the value of the current.\n\nNotice the difference in the current in all cases.\n\nDoes the current depend on the length of the conductor?\n\nDoes the current depend on the area of cross-section of the wire used?\n\nIt is observed that the ammeter reading decreases to one-half when\nthe length of the wire is doubled. The ammeter reading is increased when\na thicker wire of the same material and of the same length is used in the\ncircuit. A change in ammeter reading is observed when a wire of different\nmaterial of the same length and the same area of cross-section is used.\nOn applying Ohm’s law [Eqs. (11.5) - (11.7)], we observe that the\nresistance of the conductor depends (i) on its length, (ii) on its area of\ncross-section, and (iii) on the nature ofits material. Precise measurements\nhave shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly\nproportional to its length (l) and inversely proportional to the area of\ncross-section (A). That is,\n\nR«l (11.8)\nand R«l1/A (119)\nCombining Eqs. (11.8) and (11.9) we get\nl\nRey\nl\nor, R=p7 (11.10)\n\nwhere p (rho) is a constant of proportionality and is called the electrical\nresistivity of the material of the conductor. The SI unit of resistivity is\nQm. It is a characteristic property of the material. The metals and alloys\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nhave very low resistivity in the range of 1O§ Qmto 10° Qm. They are\ngood conductors of electricity. Insulators like rubber and glass have\nresistivity of the order of 10? to 10'7 Q m. Both the resistance and\nresistivity of a material vary with temperature.\n\nTable 11.2 reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higher\nthan that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (burn) readily\nat high temperatures. For this reason, they are commonly used in\nelectrical heating devices, like electric iron, toasters etc. Tungsten is used\nalmost exclusively for filaments of electric bulbs, whereas copper and\naluminium are generally used for electrical transmission lines.\n\nTable 11.2 Electrical resistivity* of some substances at 20°C\n\nMaterial Resistivity (Q m)\n\n* You need not memorise these values. You can use these values for solving numerical\nproblems.\n\nExample 11.3\n\n(a) How much current will an electric bulb draw from a 220 V source,\nif the resistance of the bulb filament is 1200 Q? (b) How much\ncurrent will an electric heater coil draw from a 220 V source, if\nthe resistance of the heater coil is 100 Q?\n\nSolution\n(a) We are given V= 220 V; R= 1200 Q.\n\nFrom Eq. (12.6), we have the current I= 220 V/1200 0 =0.18A.\n(b) We are given, V= 220 V, R= 100 Q.\n\nFrom Eq. (11.6), we have the current I = 220 V/100 9 =2.2 A.\nNote the difference of current drawn by an electric bulb and electric\nheater from the same 220 V source!\n\nElectricity 179\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n180\n\nExample 11.4\n\nThe potential difference between the terminals of an electric heater\nis 60 V when it draws a current of 4 A from the source. What current\nwill the heater draw if the potential difference is increased to 120 V?\nSolution\n\nWe are given, potential difference V= 60 V, current I=4 A.\nAccording to Ohm’s law, R = “ = oe =15Q,\n\nWhen the potential difference is increased to 120 V the current is\ngiven by\n\nq\n\n120V ig a.\n\nt===\ncurren R 15Q\n\nThe current through the heater becomes 8 A.\n\nExample 11.5\n\nResistance of a metal wire of length 1 m is 26 Q at 20°C. If the\ndiameter of the wire is 0.3 mm, what will be the resistivity of the\nmetal at that temperature? Using Table 11.2, predict the material\nof the wire.\n\nSolution\n\nWe are given the resistance R of the wire = 26 Q, the diameter\nd=0.3 mm =3 x 107m, and the length | of the wire = 1 m.\nTherefore, from Eq. (11.10), the resistivity of the given metallic wire is\np = (RA/I = (Rad?/4))\n\nSubstitution of values in this gives\n\np = 184x10°Qm\n\nThe resistivity of the metal at 20°C is 1.84 x 10° Q m. From\nTable 11.2, we see that this is the resistivity of manganese.\n\nExample 11.6\n\nA wire of given material having length | and area of cross-section A\nhas a resistance of 4 Q.

We\nhave noticed how the current through a conductor depends upon its\nresistance and the potential difference across its ends. In various electrical\ngadgets, we often use resistors in various combinations. We now therefore\nintend to see how Ohm’s law can be applied to combinations of resistors.\n\nThere are two methods of joining the resistors together. Figure 11.6\nshows an electric circuit in which three resistors having resistances R,,\nR, and R,, respectively, are joined end to end. Here the resistors are said\nto be connected in series.\n\nHHH -——¢\n\nFigure 11.6 Resistors in series\n\nElectricity 181\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nFigure 11.7 shows a combination of resistors in which three resistors\nare connected together between points X and Y. Here, the resistors are\nsaid to be connected in parallel.\n\nFigure 11.7 Resistors in parallel\n\n11.6.1 Resistors in Series\n\nWhat happens to the value of current when a number of resistors are\nconnected in series in a circuit? What would be their equivalent\nresistance? Let us try to understand these with the help of the following\nactivities.\n\n«© Join three resistors of different values in series. Connect them\nwith a battery, an ammeter and a plug key, as shown in Fig. 11.6.\nYou may use the resistors of values like 1 0, 2 Q, 3 QO etc., anda\nbattery of 6 V for performing this Activity.\n\n= Plug the key. Note the ammeter reading.\n= Change the position of ammeter to anywhere in between the\nresistors. Note the ammeter reading each time.\n\n= Do you find any change in the value of current through the\nammeter?\n\nYou will observe that the value of the current in the ammeter is the\nsame, independent of its position in the electric circuit. It means that in\na series combination of resistors the current is the same in every part of\nthe circuit or the same current through each resistor.\n\n182 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n= In Activity 11.4, insert a voltmeter across the ends X and Y of the\nseries combination of three resistors, as shown in Fig. 11.6.\n\n= Plug the key in the circuit and note the voltmeter reading. It\ngives the potential difference across the series combination of\nresistors. Let it be V. Now measure the potential difference across\nthe two terminals of the battery. Compare the two values.\n\n= Take out the plug key and disconnect the voltmeter. Now insert\nthe voltmeter across the ends X and P of the first resistor, as\nshown in Fig. 11.8.\n\nH HHH\n\nFigure 11.8\n\n= Plug the key and measure the potential difference across the first\nresistor. Let it be V,.\n\n= Similarly, measure the potential difference across the other two\nresistors, separately. Let these values be V, and V,, respectively.\n\n= Deduce a relationship between V, V,, V, and V,.\n\nYou will observe that the potential difference Vis equal to the sum of\npotential differences V,, V,, and V,. That is the total potential difference\nacross a combination of resistors in series is equal to the sum of potential\ndifference across the individual resistors. That is,\n\nV=V,+V, +V, (11.11)\n\nIn the electric circuit shown in Fig. 11.8, let Ibe the current through\nthe circuit. The current through each resistor is also I. It is possible to\nreplace the three resistors joined in series by an equivalent single resistor\nof resistance R, such that the potential difference V across it, and the\ncurrent J through the circuit remains the same. Applying the Ohm’s law\nto the entire circuit, we have\n\nV=IR (11.12)\n\nElectricity\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n183\n\n\n184\n\nOn applying Ohm’s law to the three resistors separately, we further\nhave\n\nV, = IR, [11.13(a)]\nV, = IR, [11.13(b)]\nand V, = IR, [11.13(c)]\n\nFrom Eq. (11.11),\nIR= IR, + TR, +R,\nor\nRK, = B, +k, +R, (11.14)\n\nWe can conclude that when several resistors are joined in series, the\n\nresistance of the combination R, equals the sum of their individual\nresistances, R_,, R,, R,, and is thus greater than any individual resistance.\n\nExample 11.7\n\nAn electric lamp, whose resistance is 20 Q, and a conductor of 4 Q\nresistance are connected to a 6 V battery (Fig. 11.9). Calculate (a) the\ntotal resistance of the circuit, (b) the current through the circuit, and (c)\nthe potential difference across the electric lamp and conductor.\n\nHHH-————>—{a),—\n\nFigure 11.9 An electric lamp connected in series with\n\na resistor of 4Q toa 6V battery\n\nSolution\n\nThe resistance of electric lamp, R, = 20Q,\n\nThe resistance of the conductor connected in series, R,= 4 Q.\nThen the total resistance in the circuit\n\nR =R,+R,\n\nR, = 209+49=24Q.\n\nThe total potential difference across the two terminals of the battery\nV=6V.\n\nNow by Ohm’s law, the current through the circuit is given by\nI = V/R,\n\n6V/24Q\n\n0.25 A.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nApplying Ohm’s law to the electric lamp and conductor separately,\nwe get potential difference across the electric lamp,\nV, = 20Q2x0.25A\n= 5V;\nand,\nthat across the conductor, V,\n\n4Qx0.25A\n= 1V.\n\nSuppose that we like to replace the series combination of electric\nlamp and conductor by a single and equivalent resistor. Its resistance\nmust be such that a potential difference of 6 V across the battery\nterminals will cause a current of 0.25 A in the circuit. The resistance\nR of this equivalent resistor would be\n\nR =V/I\n\n6V/0.25A\n\n= 24Q.\n\nThis is the total resistance of the series circuit; it is equal to the sum\nof the two resistances.\n\nDraw a schematic diagram of a circuit consisting of a battery of three\ncells of 2 V each, a 5 Q resistor, an 8 © resistor, and a 12 resistor, and\n\na plug key, all connected in series.\n\nRedraw the circuit of Question 1, putting in an ammeter to measure\nthe current through the resistors and a voltmeter to measure the\npotential difference across the 12,Q resistor. What would be the readings\nin the ammeter and the voltmeter?\n\n11.6.2 Resistors in Parallel\n\nNow, let us consider the arrangement of three resistors joined in parallel\nwith a combination of cells (or a battery), as shown in Fig.11.7.\n\n= Make a parallel combination, XY, of three \" M\nresistors having resistances R,, R,, and R,,\nrespectively. Connect it with a battery, a\nplug key and an ammeter, as shown in\nFig. 11.10. Also connect a voltmeter in\nparallel with the combination of resistors.\n\n= Plug the key and note the ammeter reading.\nLet the current be I. Also take the voltmeter 1\nreading. It gives the potential difference V,\nacross the combination. The potential\ndifference across each resistor is also V. This\ncan be checked by connecting the voltmeter\n\n= K\nHHH-——¢\n\nacross each individual resistor (see .\nFig. 11.11). Figure 11.10\n\nElectricity 185\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n= Take out the plug from the key. Remove the ammeter and voltmeter from the circuit.\nInsert the ammeter in series with the resistor R,, as shown in Fig. 11.11. Note the ammeter\nreading, I,.\n\nFigure 11.11\n\n= Similarly, measure the currents through R, and R,. Let these be I, and I,, respectively.\nWhat is the relationship between I, I,, I, and I,?\n\n1 2,\n\nIt is observed that the total current I, is equal to the sum of the\nseparate currents through each branch of the combination.\n\n[=], +5+1, (11.15)\n\nLet R, be the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination of\nresistors. By applying Ohm’s law to the parallel combination of resistors,\n\nwe have\nT=V/R, (11.16)\nOn applying Ohm’s law to each resistor, we have\nL=V/R; Le V/R,%and I,=V &, (TL. 27]\n\nFrom Eqs. (11.15) to (11.17), we have\nV/R, = V/R, #V/R, + V/R,\nor\n1/R, = 1/Myt+ 1/R, + 1/R, (1 Lu)\n\nThus, we may conclude that the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance\nof a group of resistances joined in parallel is equal to the sum of the\nreciprocals of the individual resistances.\n\nExample 11.8\n\nIn the circuit diagram given in Fig. 11.10, suppose the resistors R,,\nR, and R, have the values 5 Q, 10 Q, 30 Q, respectively, which have\nbeen connected to a battery of 12 V. Calculate (a) the current through\neach resistor, (b) the total current in the circuit, and (c) the total circuit\nresistance.\n\nSolution\nR,=5 , R,=10Q, and R, = 30 Q.\nPotential difference across the battery, V= 12 V.\nThis is also the potential difference across each of the individual\nresistor; therefore, to calculate the current in the resistors, we use\nOhm’s law.\nThe current I, through R, = V/R,\nI=12V/5Q= 24A,\n\n186 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nThe current J,, through R, = V/R,\nI,=12V/10Q9 = 1.24.\nThe current I,, through R, = V/R\n\nEL = 12 V/30Q2 = 0.4A\nThe total current in the circuit,\nP= 1,+Lt+h,\n= (2.44+12+0.4)A\n=4A\n\nThe total resistance R,,, is given by [Eq. (11.18)]\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n-l,1 ,1_\nR, 5 10 30 3\n\nThus, Ri=3Q.\n\nExample 11.9\n\nIfin Fig. 11.12, R, = 10, R,=40Q, R,=30, R,=20 Q, R, = 60 Q,\nand a 12 V battery is connected to the arrangement. Calculate\n(a) the total resistance in the circuit, and (b) the total current flowing\nin the circuit.\n\nSolution\nSuppose we replace the parallel resistors R, and R, by an\nequivalent resistor of resistance, R* Similarly we replace\nthe parallel resistors R,, R, and R, by an equivalent single\nresistor of resistance R”. Then using Eq. (11.18), wehave ,\n1/ R’=1/10+1/40 = 5/40; thatis R’ =8Q.\nSimilarly, 1/ R” = 1/30+ 1/20 + 1/60 = 6/60;\n\nthat is, R” = 10Q. -\nThus, the total resistance, R = R’+ R”= 18.\nTo calculate the current, we use Ohm’s law, and get\nI= V/R=12V/18 Q=0.67 A.\n\nWe have seen that in a series circuit the current is constant\nthroughout the electric circuit. Thus it is obviously impracticable to\nconnect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series, because they\nneed currents of widely different values to operate properly (see Example\n11.3). Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one\ncomponent fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works.\nIf you have used ‘fairy lights’ to decorate buildings on festivals, on\nmarriage celebrations etc., you might have seen the electrician spending\nlot of time in trouble-locating and replacing the ‘dead’ bulb — each has\nto be tested to find which has fused or gone. On the other hand, a parallel\ncircuit divides the current through the electrical gadgets. The total\nresistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as per Eq. (11.18). This is\nhelpful particularly when each gadget has different resistance and\nrequires different current to operate properly.\n\nElectricity\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFigure 11.12\n\nAn electric circuit showing\nthe combination of series\nand parallel resistors\n\n187\n\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nJudge the equivalent resistance when the following are connected in\nparallel - (a) 1 Q and 10% Q, (b) 1 Q and 10° Q, and 108 Q.\n\nAn electric lamp of 100 ©, a toaster of resistance 50 Q, and a water\nfilter of resistance 500 © are connected in parallel to a 220 V source.\nWhat is the resistance of an electric iron connected to the same source\nthat takes as much current as all three appliances, and what is the\ncurrent through it?\n\nWhat are the advantages of connecting electrical devices in parallel\nwith the battery instead of connecting them in series?\n\nHow can three resistors of resistances 2 Q, 3 Q, and 6 © be connected\nto give a total resistance of (a) 4 Q, (b) 1 Q?\n\nWhat is (a) the highest, (b) the lowest total resistance that can be secured\nby combinations of four coils of resistance 4 Q, 8 Q, 12 Q, 24 Q?\n\n11.7 HEATING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT\n\nWe know that a battery or a cell is a source of electrical energy. The\nchemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between\nits two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current\nthrough a resistor or a system of resistors connected to the battery. We\nhave also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source\nhas to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of\nthe source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into\nuseful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the\nsource energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of\ngadget. We often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric\nfan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other\nhand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of\nresistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets\ndissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating\neffect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric\nheater, electric iron etc.\n\nConsider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance R. Let\nthe potential difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let tbe the time during\nwhich a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q\nthrough a potential difference Vis VQ. Therefore, the source must supply\nenergy equal to VQ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the\nsource is\n\npavoevi (11,79)\n\nOr the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time tis Px t,\nthat is, Vit. What happens to this energy expended by the source? This\nenergy gets dissipated in the resistor as heat. Thus for a steady\ncurrent I, the amount of heat H produced in time tis\n\nH=VIt (11.20)\n\n188 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nApplying Ohm’s law [Eq. (11.5)], we get\n\nH=F Rt (11.21)\n\nThis is known as Joule’s law of heating. The\nlaw implies that heat produced in a resistor is\n(i) directly proportional to the square of current\nfor a given resistance, (ii) directly proportional to\nresistance for a given current, and (iii) directly\nproportional to the time for which the current flows\nthrough the resistor. In practical situations, when\nan electric appliance is connected to a known\nvoltage source, Eq. (11.21) is used after\n\ncalculating the current through it, using the Figure 11.13\nrelation I= V/R. A steady current in a purely resistive electric circuit\n\nExample 11.10\n\nAn electric iron consumes energy at a rate of 840 W when heating is\nat the maximum rate and 360 W when the heating is at the minimum.\nThe voltage is 220 V. What are the current and the resistance in each\ncase?\n\nSolution\nFrom Eq. (11.19), we know that the power input is\nP=VI\nThus the current I= P/V\n(a) When heating is at the maximum rate,\nI= 840 W/220 V = 3.82 A;\nand the resistance of the electric iron is\nR=V/I=220 V/3.82 A= 57.60 Q.\n(b) When heating is at the minimum rate,\nI= 360 W/220 V = 1.64 A;\nand the resistance of the electric iron is\nR=V/I=220V/1.64 A= 134.15 Q.\n\nExample 11.11\n100 J of heat is produced each second in a 4 Q resistance. Find the\npotential difference across the resistor.\n\nSolution\nH=100J, R=4Q0,t=1s, V=?\nFrom Eq. (11.21) we have the current through the resistor as\n\nI = V(H/RO\n=  \\[100J/(44Q2x1s)]\n= 5A\n\nThus the potential difference across the resistor, V [from Eq. (11.5)] is\n\nV = IR\n= 5Ax4Q\n= 20V.\n\nElectricity 189\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nWhy does the cord of an electric heater not glow while the heating element\n\n190\n\ndoes?\n\nCompute the heat generated while transferring 96000 coulomb of charge\nin one hour through a potential difference of 50 V.\n\nAn electric iron of resistance 20 © takes a current of 5 A.

In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful\nelectrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating\ncan increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties.\nHowever, heating effect of electric current has many useful applications.\nThe electric laundry iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric kettle\nand electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule’s\nheating.\n\nThe electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric\nbulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is\npossible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such\nhigh temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as\ntungsten (melting point 3380°C) is used for making bulb filaments. The\nfilament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using\ninsulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically\ninactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of\nthe power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part\nof it is in the form of light radiated.\n\nAnother common application of Joule’s heating is the fuse used in\nelectric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow\nof any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with\nthe device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of\nappropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper, iron, lead\netc. Ifa current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit,\nthe temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and\nbreaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of\nporcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic\npurposes are rated as 1 A, 2A, 3A, 5A, 10A, etc. For an electric iron\nwhich consumes | kW electric power when operated at 220 V, a current\nof (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit. In this case,a5A\nfuse must be used.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n11.8 ELECTRIC POWER\n\nYou have studied in your earlier Class that the rate of doing work is\npower. This is also the rate of consumption of energy.\n\nEquation (11.21) gives the rate at which electric energy is dissipated\nor consumed in an electric circuit. This is also termed as electric power.\nThe power P is given by\n\nP = VI\n\nOr P = PR=V?/R (1:14:22)\n\nThe SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is the power consumed by\na device that carries 1 A of current when operated at a potential difference\nof 1 V. Thus,\n\n1W = lvoltx 1 ampere=1VA (11,23)\n\nThe unit ‘watt’ is very small. Therefore, in actual practice we use a\nmuch larger unit called ‘kilowatt’. It is equal to 1000 watts. Since electrical\nenergy is the product of power and time, the unit of electric energy is,\ntherefore, watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy consumed when\n1 watt of power is used for 1 hour. The commercial unit of electric energy\nis kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as ‘unit’.\n\n1kWh = 1000 watt x 3600 second\n3.6 X 10° watt second\n\n3.6 X 10° joule (J)\n\nMore to Know!\n\nExample 11.12\n\nAn electric bulb is connected to a 220 V generator. The current is\n0.50 A. What is the power of the bulb?\n\nSolution\n\nP = VI\n= 220Vx0.50A\n= 110J/s\n= 110W.\n\nExample 11.13\n\nAn electric refrigerator rated 400 W operates 8 hour/day. What is\nthe cost of the energy to operate it for 30 days at Rs 3.00 per kW h?\n\nElectricity\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n191\n\n\nSolution\nThe total energy consumed by the refrigerator in 30 days would be\n400 W x 8.0 hour/day x 30 days = 96000 W h\n=96kWh\nThus the cost of energy to operate the refrigerator for 30 days is\n96 kW h x Rs 3.00 per kW h = Rs 288.00\n\nQ U ES TION S\n\nWhat determines the rate at which energy is delivered by a current?\n\nAn electric motor takes 5 A from a 220 V line.

A cell\ngenerates a potential difference across its terminals. It is measured in volts (V).\n\nResistance is a property that resists the flow of electrons in a conductor. It controls\nthe magnitude of the current. The SI unit of resistance is ohm (Q).\n\nOhm’s law: The potential difference across the ends of a resistor is directly\nproportional to the current through it, provided its temperature remains the same.\n\nThe resistance of a conductor depends directly on its length, inversely on its area of\ncross-section, and also on the material of the conductor.\n\nThe equivalent resistance of several resistors in series is equal to the sum of\ntheir individual resistances.\n\nA set of resistors connected in parallel has an equivalent resistance R, given by\n\n1.1.1\nR, Ry Rg\n\np\n\nThe electrical energy dissipated in a resistor is given by\nW=VxIxt\n\nThe unit of power is watt (W).

It is a controllable\n\nand convenient form of energy for a variety of uses in homes, schools,\nhospitals, industries and so on. What constitutes electricity? How does\nit flow in an electric circuit? What are the factors that control or regulate\nthe current through an electric circuit? In this Chapter, we shall attempt\nto answer such questions. We shall also discuss the heating effect of\nelectric current and its applications.\n\n11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT\n\nWe are familiar with air current and water current. We know that flowing\nwater constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge\nflows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we\nsay that there is an electric current in the conductor. In a torch, we\nknow that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide\nflow of charges or an electric current through the torch bulb to glow. We\nhave also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What\ndoes a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and\nthe bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an\nelectric circuit. Now, ifthe circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the\ntorch is turned off), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow.\n\nHow do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by\nthe amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In\nother words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using\nmetallic wires, electrons constitute the flow of charges. However, electrons\nwere not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first\nobserved. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive\ncharges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the\ndirection of electric current. Conventionally, in an electric circuit the\ndirection of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the\nflow of electrons, which are negative charges.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n1064CH12\n",

(We know that an\nelectron possesses a negative charge of 1.6 x 10'9C.) The electric\ncurrent is expressed by a unit called ampere (A), named after the\nFrench scientist, Andre-Marie Ampere (1775-1836). One ampere is\nconstituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second, that is,\n1A=1C/1s.

Charges do not flow in a copper wire by themselves, just as\nwater in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube\nis connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a\npressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of\nthe other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic\nwire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only\nif there is a difference of electric pressure - called the potential difference —\nalong the conductor. This difference of potential may be produced by a\nbattery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within\na cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell,\neven when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a\nconducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in\nmotion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to\nmaintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its\nchemical energy stored in it.\n\nWe define the electric potential difference between two points in an\nelectric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit\ncharge from one point to the other -\n\nPotential difference (V) between two points = Work done (W)/Charge (Q)\n\nV = w/Q (91.2)\n\nThe SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after\nAlessandro Volta (1745-1827), an Italian physicist.

Thus the V-I\ngraph is a straight line that passes through the origin of\nthe graph, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, V/Iis a constant\nratio.\n\nIn 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm\n(1787-1854) found out the relationship between the current\nI, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference\nacross its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the\nends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly\nproportional to the current flowing through it, provided its\n\n° ee ( —- o-6 temperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law. In\nother words —\nFigure 11.3\nV-I graph for a nichrome wire. A Vel (11.4)\nstraight line plot shows that as the or V/I = constant\ncurrent through a wire increases, the = R\npotential difference across the wire or V = JR (11.5)\n\nincreases linearly — this is Ohm’s law.\n\nIn Eq. (11.4), Ris a constant for the given metallic wire\n\nat a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the\n\nproperty of a conductor to resist the flow of charges through it. Its SI\nunit is ohm, represented by the Greek letter Q. According to Ohm’s law,\n\nR=V/I (11.6)\n\nIf the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V\nand the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor\n\n1 volt\n\nis 1 Q. Thatis, 1 ohm = ———\n1 ampere\n\nAlso from Eq. (11.5) we get\n\nI=V/R (11.7)\n\nIt is obvious from Eq. (11.7) that the current through a resistor is\ninversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the\ncurrent gets halved. In many practical cases it is necessary to increase\nor decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to\nregulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable\nresistance. In an electric circuit, a device called rheostat is often used to\nchange the resistance in the circuit.

Certain components offer an easy path\nfor the flow of electric current while the others resist the flow. We know\nthat motion of electrons in an electric circuit constitutes an electric\ncurrent. The electrons, however, are not completely free to move within a\nconductor. They are restrained by the attraction of the atoms among\nwhich they move. Thus, motion of electrons through a conductor is\nretarded by its resistance. A component of a given size that offers a low\nresistance is a good conductor.

We\nhave also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source\nhas to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of\nthe source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into\nuseful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the\nsource energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of\ngadget. We often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric\nfan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other\nhand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of\nresistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets\ndissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating\neffect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric\nheater, electric iron etc.\n\nConsider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance R. Let\nthe potential difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let tbe the time during\nwhich a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q\nthrough a potential difference Vis VQ. Therefore, the source must supply\nenergy equal to VQ in time t.

In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful\nelectrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating\ncan increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties.\nHowever, heating effect of electric current has many useful applications.\nThe electric laundry iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric kettle\nand electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule’s\nheating.\n\nThe electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric\nbulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is\npossible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such\nhigh temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as\ntungsten (melting point 3380°C) is used for making bulb filaments. The\nfilament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using\ninsulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically\ninactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of\nthe power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part\nof it is in the form of light radiated.\n\nAnother common application of Joule’s heating is the fuse used in\nelectric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow\nof any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with\nthe device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of\nappropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper, iron, lead\netc. Ifa current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit,\nthe temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and\nbreaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of\nporcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic\npurposes are rated as 1 A, 2A, 3A, 5A, 10A, etc. For an electric iron\nwhich consumes | kW electric power when operated at 220 V, a current\nof (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit. In this case,a5A\nfuse must be used.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

What could be the other effects of electric\ncurrent? We know that an electric current-carrying wire behaves like a\nmagnet. Let us perform the following Activity to reinforce it.\n\nResistor R\n\n— Long straight\nconductor\n\n= Take a straight thick copper wire and place it\nbetween the points X and Y in an electric circuit,\nas shown in Fig. 12.1. The wire XY is kept D\nperpendicular to the plane of paper.\n\n= Horizontally place a small compass near to this\ncopper wire. See the position of its needle.\n\n= Pass the current through the circuit by ‘ K\ninserting the key into the plug. Figure 12.1\n\n= Observe the change in the position of the Compass needle is deflected on passing an electric\ncompass needle. current through a metallic conductor\n\nWe see that the needle is deflected. What does it mean? It means that\nthe electric current through the copper wire has produced a magnetic\neffect. Thus we can say that electricity and magnetism are linked to each\nother. Then, what about the reverse possibility of an electric effect of\nmoving magnets? In this Chapter we will study magnetic fields and such\nelectromagnetic effects. We shall also study about electromagnets which\ninvolve the magnetic effect of electric current.\n\nHans Christian Oersted (1777-1851)\n\nHans Christian Oersted, one of the leading scientists of the 19%\n\ncentury, played a crucial role in understanding electromagnetism. In\n\n1820 he accidentally discovered that a compass needle got deflected e ©\nwhen an electric current passed through a metallic wire placed nearby. ee\nThrough this observation Oersted showed that electricity and \\\nmagnetism were related phenomena. His research later created\n\ntechnologies such as the radio, television and fiber optics. The unit of\n\nmagnetic field strength is named the oersted in his honor.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n12.1 MAGNETIC FIELD AND FIELD LINES\n\nWe are familiar with the fact that a compass needle gets deflected when\nbrought near a bar magnet. A compass needle is, in fact, a small bar\nmagnet. The ends of the compass needle point approximately towards\nnorth and south directions. The end pointing towards north is called north\nseeking or north pole. The other end that points towards south is called\nsouth seeking or south pole. Through various activities we have observed\nthat like poles repel, while unlike poles of magnets attract each other.\n\nQ U ES TION\n\nWhy does a compass needle get deflected when brought near\n\na bar magnet?\n\n196\n\nFix a sheet of white paper on a drawing\nboard using some adhesive material.\nPlace a bar magnet in the centre of it.\nSprinkle some iron filings uniformly\naround the bar magnet (Fig. 12.2). A\nsalt-sprinkler may be used for this\npurpose.\n\nNow tap the board gently.\n\nWhat do you observe? Figure 12.2\n\nIron filings near the bar magnet align\nthemselves along the field lines.\n\nThe iron filings arrange themselves in a pattern as shown\nFig. 12.2. Why do the iron filings arrange in such a pattern? What does\nthis pattern demonstrate? The magnet exerts its influence in the region\nsurrounding it. Therefore the iron filings experience a force. The force\nthus exerted makes iron filings to arrange in a pattern. The region\nsurrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected,\nis said to have a magnetic field. The lines along which the iron filings\nalign themselves represent magnetic field lines.\n\nAre there other ways of obtaining magnetic field lines around a bar\nmagnet? Yes, you can yourself draw the field lines of a bar magnet.\n\nActivity 12.3\n\n= Take a small compass and a bar magnet.\n\n= Place the magnet on a sheet of white paper fixed on a drawing\nboard, using some adhesive material.\n\n= Mark the boundary of the magnet.\n\n= Place the compass near the north pole of the magnet. How does\nit behave? The south pole of the needle points towards the north\npole of the magnet. The north pole of the compass is directed\naway from the north pole of the magnet.\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nMark the position of two ends of the needle.\nNow move the needle to a new position ®\nsuch that its south pole occupies the Fs)\nposition previously occupied by its north\npole. 53\n= In this way, proceed step by step till you N\nreach the south pole of the magnet as\nshown in Fig. 12.3.\n= Join the points marked on the paper by a\nsmooth curve. This curve represents compass needle\na field line.\n= Repeat the above procedure and draw as\nmany lines as you can. You will get a\npattern shown in Fig. 12.4. These lines\nrepresent the magnetic field around the\nmagnet. These are known as magnetic\nfield lines.\n= Observe the deflection in the compass\nneedle as you move it along a field line.\nThe deflection increases as the needle is\nmoved towards the poles.\n\nFigure 12.3\n\nFigure 12.4\n\nField lines around a bar magnet\n\nMagnetic field is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude.\nThe direction of the magnetic field is taken to be the direction in which a\nnorth pole of the compass needle moves inside it. Therefore it is taken\nby convention that the field lines emerge from north pole and merge at\nthe south pole (note the arrows marked on the field lines in Fig. 12.4).\nInside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its\nnorth pole. Thus the magnetic field lines are closed curves.\n\nThe relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree of\ncloseness of the field lines. The field is stronger, that is, the force acting\non the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are\ncrowded (see Fig. 12.4).\n\nNo two field-lines are found to cross each other. If they did, it would\nmean that at the point of intersection, the compass needle would point\ntowards two directions, which is not possible.\n\n12.2 MAGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT-CARRYING\nCONDUCTOR\n\nIn Activity 12.1, we have seen that an electric current through a\nmetallic conductor produces a magnetic field around it. In order to\nfind the direction of the field produced let us repeat the activity in the\nfollowing way —\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nDrawing a magnetic field line with the help ofa\n\n197\n\n\nActivity 12.4\n\n= Take a long straight copper wire, two or three cells of 1.5 V each, and a plug key. Connect\nall of them in series as shown in Fig. 12.5 (a).\n\n= Place the straight wire parallel to and over a compass needle.\n\n= Plug the key in the circuit.\n\n= Observe the direction of deflection of the north pole of the needle. If the current flows from\nnorth to south, as shown in Fig. 12.5 (a), the north pole of the compass needle would move\ntowards the east.\n\n= Replace the cell connections in the circuit as shown in Fig. 12.5 (b). This would result in\nthe change of the direction of current through the copper wire, that is, from south to\nnorth.\n\n= Observe the change in the direction of deflection of the needle. You will see that now the\nneedle moves in opposite direction, that is, towards the west [Fig. 12.5 (b)]. It means that\nthe direction of magnetic field produced by the electric current is also reversed.\n\nN\nx\nNorth W\n\n\\ gast, ©\n\nAw\n\n4\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 12.5 A simple electric circuit in which a straight copper wire is placed parallel to and over a compass\nneedle. The deflection in the needle becomes opposite when the direction of the current is reversed.\n\n12.2.1 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a Straight\nConductor\n\nWhat determines the pattern of the magnetic field generated by a current\nthrough a conductor? Does the pattern depend on the shape of the\nconductor? We shall investigate this with an activity.\n\nWe shall first consider the pattern of the magnetic field around a\nstraight conductor carrying current.\n\nActivity 12.5\n\n= Take a battery (12 V), a variable resistance (or a rheostat), an\nammeter (0-5 A), a plug key, connecting wires and a long straight\nthick copper wire.\n\n= Insert the thick wire through the centre, normal to the plane of a\nrectangular cardboard. Take care that the cardboard is fixed and\ndoes not slide up or down.\n\n198 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n= Connect the copper wire vertically between the\npoints X and Y, as shown in Fig. 12.6 (a), in\nseries with the battery, a plug and key.\n\n= Sprinkle some iron filings uniformly on the\ncardboard. (You may use a salt sprinkler for this\npurpose.)\n\n= Keep the variable of the rheostat at a fixed\nposition and note the current through the\nammeter.\n\n= Close the key so that a current flows through\nthe wire. Ensure that the copper wire placed\nbetween the points X and Y remains vertically\nstraight.\n\n= Gently tap the cardboard a few times. Observe\nthe pattern of the iron filings. You would find\nthat the iron filings align themselves showing\na pattern of concentric circles around the\ncopper wire (Fig. 12.6).\n\n= What do these concentric circles represent?\nThey represent the magnetic field lines.\n\n= How can the direction of the magnetic field be\nfound? Place a compass at a point (say P) over\na circle. Observe the direction of the needle. The\ndirection of the north pole of the compass\nneedle would give the direction of the field lines\nproduced by the electric current through the\nstraight wire at point P. Show the direction by\nan arrow.\n\n= Does the direction of magnetic field lines get\nreversed if the direction of current through the\nstraight copper wire is reversed? Check it.\n\nFigure 12.6\n\nWhat happens to the deflection of the compass needle placed at a\ngiven point if the current in the copper wire is changed? To see this, vary\nthe current in the wire. We find that the deflection in the needle also\nchanges. In fact, ifthe current is increased, the deflection also increases.\nIt indicates that the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a given\npoint increases as the current through the wire increases.\n\nWhat happens to the deflection of the needle if the compass is moved\naway from the copper wire but the current through the wire remains the\nsame? To see this, now place the compass at a farther point from the\nconducting wire (say at point Q). What change do you observe? We see\nthat the deflection in the needle decreases. Thus the magnetic field\nproduced by a given current in the conductor decreases as the distance\nfrom it increases. From Fig. 12.6, it can be noticed that the concentric\ncircles representing the magnetic field around a current-carrying straight\nwire become larger and larger as we move away from it.\n\n12.2.2 Right-Hand Thumb Rule\n\nA convenient way of finding the direction of magnetic field associated\nwith a current-carrying conductor is given in Fig. 12.7.\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nVariable\nresistance\n\n(a) A pattern of concentric circles indicating\nthe field lines of a magnetic field around a\nstraight conducting wire. The arrows in the\ncircles show the direction of the field lines.\n(b) A close up of the pattern obtained.\n\n199\n\n\nImagine that you are holding a current-carrying straight\nconductor in your right hand such that the thumb points towards\nthe direction of current. Then your fingers will wrap around the\nconductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field, as\nshown in Fig. 12.7. This is known as the right-hand thumb rule”.\n\nMagnetic\nField\n\nExample 12.1\n\nFigure 12.7 A current through a horizontal power line flows in east to west\n\nRight-hand thumb rule direction. What is the direction of magnetic field at a point directly\nbelow it and at a point directly above it?\n\nSolution\n\nThe current is in the east-west direction. Applying the right-hand\nthumb rule, we get that the magnetic field (at any point below or\nabove the wire) turns clockwise in a plane perpendicular to the wire,\nwhen viewed from the east end, and anti-clockwise, when viewed\nfrom the west end.\n\nDraw magnetic field lines around a bar magnet.\nList the properties of magnetic field lines.\nWhy don’t two magnetic field lines intersect each other?\n\n12.2.3 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a\nCircular Loop\n\nWe have so far observed the pattern of the magnetic field lines\nproduced around a current-carrying straight wire. Suppose\nthis straight wire is bent in the form ofa circular loop anda\ncurrent is passed through it. How would the magnetic field\nlines look like? We know that the magnetic field produced\nby a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the\ndistance from it. Similarly at every point of a current-carrying\ncircular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic\nfield around it would become larger and larger as we move\naway from the wire (Fig. 12.8). By the time we reach at the\ncentre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would\nFigure 12.8 appear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying\nMagnetic field lines of the field current would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as\nproduced by a current-carrying straight lines at the center of the loop. By applying the right\ncircular loop iis : f\n\nhand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire\ncontributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction\nwithin the loop.\n\n* This rule is also called Maxwell’s corkscrew rule. If we consider ourselves driving a\ncorkscrew in the direction of the current, then the direction of the rotation of\ncorkscrew is the direction of the magnetic field.\n\n200 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nWe know that the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying\nwire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it.\nTherefore, if there is a circular coil having n turns, the field produced is\nn times as large as that produced by a single turn. This is because the\ncurrent in each circular turn has the same direction, and the field due to\n\neach turn then just adds up.\n\n= Take a rectangular cardboard having two holes.\nInsert a circular coil having large number of turns\nthrough them, normal to the plane of the cardboard.\n\n= Connect the ends of the coil in series with a battery,\na key and a rheostat, as shown in Fig. 12.9.\n\n= Sprinkle iron filings uniformly on the cardboard.\n\n= Plug the key.\n\n= Tap the cardboard gently a few times. Note the\npattern of the iron filings that emerges on the\ncardboard.\n\nhE\n\nFigure 12.9\nMagnetic field produced by a current-\n\ncarrying circular coil.\n\n12.2.4 Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Solenoid\n\nA coil of many circular turns of insulated copper wire wrapped\nclosely in the shape of a cylinder is called a solenoid. The pattern\nof the magnetic field lines around a current-carrying solenoid is\nshown in Fig. 12.10. Compare the pattern of the field with the\nmagnetic field around a bar magnet (Fig. 12.4). Do they look\nsimilar? Yes, they are similar. In fact, one end of the solenoid\nbehaves as a magnetic north pole, while the other behaves as the\nsouth pole. The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of\nparallel straight lines. This indicates that the magnetic field is\nthe same at all points inside the solenoid. That is, the field is\nuniform inside the solenoid.\n\nA strong magnetic field produced inside a solenoid can be\nused to magnetise a piece of magnetic material, like soft iron,\nwhen placed inside the coil (Fig. 12.11). The magnet so formed is\ncalled an electromagnet.\n\nQ UES TION S\n\niL. Consider a circular loop of wire lying in\nthe plane of the table. Let the current\npass through the loop clockwise.

The field so produced exerts a force on a\nmagnet placed in the vicinity of the conductor. French scientist Andre\nMarie Ampere (1775-1836) suggested that the magnet must also exert\nan equal and opposite force on the current-carrying conductor. The force\ndue to a magnetic field acting on a current-carrying conductor can be\ndemonstrated through the following activity.\n\n= Take a small aluminium rod AB (of about 5 cm). Using\ntwo connecting wires suspend it horizontally from a\nstand, as shown in Fig. 12.12.\n\n= Place a strong horse-shoe magnet in such a way that\nthe rod lies between the two poles with the magnetic\nfield directed upwards. For this put the north pole of\nthe magnet vertically below and south pole vertically\nabove the aluminium rod (Fig. 12.12).\n\n= Connect the aluminium rod in series with a battery,\na key and a rheostat.\n\n= Now pass a current through the aluminium rod from\nend B to end A.\n\n= What do you observe? It is observed that the rod is\ndisplaced towards the left. You will notice that the rod\ngets displaced.\n\n= Reverse the direction of current flowing through the Figure 12.12\nrod and observe the direction of its displacement. It is A current-carrying rod, AB, experiences\nnow towards the right. a force perpendicular to its length and\nWhy does the rod get displaced? the magnetic field. Support for the\n\nmagnet is not shown here, for simplicity.\n\nThe displacement of the rod in the above activity suggests that a\nforce is exerted on the current-carrying aluminium rod when it is placed\nin a magnetic field. It also suggests that the direction of force is also\nreversed when the direction of current through the conductor is reversed.\nNow change the direction of field to vertically downwards by\ninterchanging the two poles of the magnet. It is once again observed that\n\n202 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nthe direction of force acting on the current-carrying rod gets reversed. It\nshows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the\ndirection of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experiments\nhave shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the magnitude\nof the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right angles\nto the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use a\nsimple rule to find the direction of the force on the conductor.\n\nIn Activity 12.7, we considered the\ndirection of the current and that of the magnetic\nfield perpendicular to each other and found\nthat the force is perpendicular to both of them.\nThe three directions can be illustrated through\na simple rule, called Fleming’s left-hand rule.\nAccording to this rule, stretch the thumb,\nforefinger and middle finger of your left hand\nsuch that they are mutually perpendicular\n(Fig. 12.13). If the first finger points in the\ndirection of magnetic field and the second\nfinger in the direction of current, then the\nthumb will point in the direction of motion or Figure 12.13\nthe force acting on the conductor. mies Iie havtd rule\n\nDevices that use current-carrying conductors and magnetic fields\ninclude electric motor, electric generator, loudspeakers, microphones\nand measuring instruments.\n\nField\n\nThumb - Motion\n\nCurrent\n\nExample 12.2\n\nAn electron enters a magnetic field at right angles to it, as shown\nin Fig. 12.14.

One of the wires in this supply, usually with\nred insulation cover, is called live wire (or positive). Another wire, with\nblack insulation, is called neutral wire (or negative). In our country, the\npotential difference between the two is 220 V.\n\nAt the meter-board in the house, these wires pass into an electricity\nmeter through a main fuse. Through the main switch they are connected\nto the line wires in the house. These wires supply electricity to separate\ncircuits within the house. Often, two separate circuits are used, one of\n15 A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as\ngeysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5 A current rating for\nbulbs, fans, etc. The earth wire, which has insulation of green colour, is\nusually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house.\nThis is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that\nhave a metallic body, for example, electric press, toaster, table fan,\nrefrigerator, etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, which\nprovides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. Thus, it\nensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance\nkeeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe\nelectric shock.\n\n204 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nEarth\nwire\nLive\nwire\nNeutral\nwire\n\nElectricity =\n\nBoard’s fase Electricity\nmeter\nDistribution\nbox containing\n\nmain switch and fuses\nfor each circuit\n\nFigure 12.15 A schematic diagram of one of the common domestic circuits\n\nFigure 12.15 gives a schematic diagram of one of the common\ndomestic circuits. In each separate circuit, different appliances can be\nconnected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a\nseparate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order\nthat each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected\nparallel to each other.\n\nElectric fuse is an important component of all domestic circuits. We\nhave already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous\nchapter (see Section 11.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the\nappliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur\nwhen the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This\noccurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the\nappliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly\nincreases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse\nprevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage\nby stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating\nthat takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit.\nOverloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply\nvoltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many\nappliances to a single socket.\n\nQ U ES TION S$\n\nName two safety measures commonly used in electric circuits and\nappliances.\n\nAn electric oven of 2 kW power rating is operated in a domestic electric\ncircuit (220 V) that has a current rating of 5 A.

        "text": "12.1 MAGNETIC FIELD AND FIELD LINES\n\nWe are familiar with the fact that a compass needle gets deflected when\nbrought near a bar magnet. A compass needle is, in fact, a small bar\nmagnet. The ends of the compass needle point approximately towards\nnorth and south directions. The end pointing towards north is called north\nseeking or north pole. The other end that points towards south is called\nsouth seeking or south pole. Through various activities we have observed\nthat like poles repel, while unlike poles of magnets attract each other.\n\nQ U ES TION\n\nWhy does a compass needle get deflected when brought near\n\na bar magnet?\n\n196\n\nFix a sheet of white paper on a drawing\nboard using some adhesive material.\nPlace a bar magnet in the centre of it.\nSprinkle some iron filings uniformly\naround the bar magnet (Fig. 12.2).

Figure 12.2\n\nIron filings near the bar magnet align\nthemselves along the field lines.\n\nThe iron filings arrange themselves in a pattern as shown\nFig. 12.2. Why do the iron filings arrange in such a pattern? What does\nthis pattern demonstrate? The magnet exerts its influence in the region\nsurrounding it. Therefore the iron filings experience a force. The force\nthus exerted makes iron filings to arrange in a pattern. The region\nsurrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected,\nis said to have a magnetic field. The lines along which the iron filings\nalign themselves represent magnetic field lines.\n\nAre there other ways of obtaining magnetic field lines around a bar\nmagnet?

One of the wires in this supply, usually with\nred insulation cover, is called live wire (or positive). Another wire, with\nblack insulation, is called neutral wire (or negative). In our country, the\npotential difference between the two is 220 V.\n\nAt the meter-board in the house, these wires pass into an electricity\nmeter through a main fuse. Through the main switch they are connected\nto the line wires in the house. These wires supply electricity to separate\ncircuits within the house. Often, two separate circuits are used, one of\n15 A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as\ngeysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5 A current rating for\nbulbs, fans, etc. The earth wire, which has insulation of green colour, is\nusually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house.\nThis is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that\nhave a metallic body, for example, electric press, toaster, table fan,\nrefrigerator, etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, which\nprovides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. Thus, it\nensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance\nkeeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe\nelectric shock.\n\n204 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

In each separate circuit, different appliances can be\nconnected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a\nseparate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order\nthat each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected\nparallel to each other.\n\nElectric fuse is an important component of all domestic circuits. We\nhave already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous\nchapter (see Section 11.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the\nappliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur\nwhen the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This\noccurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the\nappliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly\nincreases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse\nprevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage\nby stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating\nthat takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit.\nOverloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply\nvoltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many\nappliances to a single socket.\n\nQ U ES TION S$\n\nName two safety measures commonly used in electric circuits and\nappliances.\n\nAn electric oven of 2 kW power rating is operated in a domestic electric\ncircuit (220 V) that has a current rating of 5 A.

Our elders tell\nus that the ‘environment is not what it used to be earlier; others say that\nwe should work in a healthy ‘environment’; and global summits involving\nthe developed and developing countries are regularly held to discuss\n‘environmental’ issues. In this chapter, we shall be studying how various\ncomponents in the environment interact with each other and how we\nimpact the environment.\n\n13.1 ECO-SYSTEM — WHAT ARE ITS COMPONENTS?\n\nAll organisms such as plants, animals, microorganisms and human\nbeings as well as the physical surroundings interact with each other\nand maintain a balance in nature. All the interacting organisms in an\narea together with the non-living constituents of the environment form\nan ecosystem. Thus, an ecosystem consists of biotic components\ncomprising living organisms and abiotic components comprising\nphysical factors like temperature, rainfall, wind, soil and minerals.\n\nFor example, if you visit a garden you will find different plants, such\nas grasses, trees; flower bearing plants like rose, jasmine, sunflower;\nand animals like frogs, insects and birds. All these living organisms\ninteract with each other and their growth, reproduction and other\nactivities are affected by the abiotic components of ecosystem. So a garden\nis an ecosystem. Other types of ecosystems are forests, ponds and lakes.\nThese are natural ecosystems while gardens and crop-fields are human-\nmade (artificial) ecosystems.\n\ni oe eee ey\nctivity 13.1\n\n= You might have seen an aquarium. Let us try to design one.\n\n= What are the things that we need to keep in mind when we create\nan aquarium? The fish would need a free space for swimming (it\ncould be a large jar), water, oxygen and food.\n\n= We can provide oxygen through an oxygen pump (aerator) and\nfish food which is available in the market.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n= If we add a few aquatic plants and animals it can become a self-\nsustaining system. Can you think how this happens? An aquarium\nis an example of a human-made ecosystem.\n\n= Can we leave the aquarium as such after we set it up? Why does\nit have to be cleaned once in a while? Do we have to clean ponds\nor lakes in the same manner? Why or why not?\n\nWe have seen in earlier classes that organisms can be grouped as\nproducers, consumers and decomposers according to the manner in\nwhich they obtain their sustenance from the environment. Let us recall\nwhat we have learnt through the self sustaining ecosystem created by\nus above. Which organisms can make organic compounds like sugar\nand starch from inorganic substances using the radiant energy of the\nSun in the presence of chlorophyll? All green plants and certain bacteria\nwhich can produce food by photosynthesis come under this category\nand are called the producers.\n\nOrganisms depend on the producers either directly or indirectly for\ntheir sustenance? These organisms which consume the food produced,\neither directly from producers or indirectly by feeding on other consumers\nare the consumers. Consumers can be classed variously as herbivores,\ncarnivores, omnivores and parasites. Can you give examples for each of\nthese categories of consumers?\n\n= Imagine the situation where you do not clean the aquarium and\nsome fish and plants have died. Have you ever thought what\nhappens when an organism dies? The microorganisms, comprising\nbacteria and fungi, break-down the dead remains and waste\nproducts of organisms. These microorganisms are the decomposers\nas they break-down the complex organic substances into simple\ninorganic substances that go into the soil and are used up once\nmore by the plants. What will happen to the garbage, and dead\nanimals and plants in their absence? Will the natural replenishment\nof the soil take place, even if decomposers are not there?\n\n= While creating an aquarium did you take care not to put an aquatic\nanimal which would eat others? What would have happened\notherwise?\n\n= Make groups and discuss how each of the above groups of\norganisms are dependent on each other.\n\n= Write the aquatic organisms in order of who eats whom and form\n\na chain of at least three steps. > >\n\n= Would you consider any one group of organisms to be of primary\nimportance? Why or why not?\n\nOur Environment\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n209\n\n\nFigure 13.1\n\nFood chain in nature\n(a) in forest, (b) in\ngrassland and (c) ina\npond\n\nTertiary\nconsumers\n\n‘Secondary\nconsumers\n\nFigure 13.2\nTrophic levels\n\n210\n\n13.1.1 Food Chains and Webs\n\nIn Activity 13.4 we have formed a series of organisms feeding\non one another. This series or organisms taking part at\nvarious biotic levels form a food chain (Fig. 13.1).\n\nEach step or level of the food chain forms a trophic level.\nThe autotrophs or the producers are at the first trophic level.\nThey fix up the solar energy and make it available for\nheterotrophs or the consumers. The herbivores or the primary\nconsumers come at the second, small carnivores or the\nsecondary consumers at the third and larger carnivores or\nthe tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level (Fig. 13.2).\n\nWe know that the food we eat acts as a fuel to provide us\nenergy to do work. Thus the interactions among various\ncomponents of the environment involves flow of energy from\none component of the system to another. As we have studied,\nthe autotrophs capture the energy present in sunlight and\nconvert it into chemical energy. This energy supports all the\nactivities of the living world. From autotrophs, the energy goes\nto the heterotrophs and decomposers. However, as we saw in\nthe previous Chapter on ‘Sources of Energy’, when one form\nof energy is changed to another, some energy is lost to the\nenvironment in forms which cannot be used again. The flow\nof energy between various components of the environment\nhas been extensively studied and it has been found that —\nThe green plants in a terrestrial ecosystem capture about\n1% of the energy of sunlight that falls on their leaves and convert it\ninto food energy.\n\nWhen green plants are eaten by primary consumers, a great deal\nof energy is lost as heat to the environment, some amount goes\ninto digestion and in doing work and the rest goes towards growth\nand reproduction. An average of 10% of the food eaten is turned\ninto its own body and made available for the next level of\nconsumers.\n\nTherefore, 10% can be taken as the average value for the amount\nof organic matter that is present at each step and reaches the next\nlevel of consumers.\n\nSince so little energy is available for the next level of consumers,\nfood chains generally consist of only three or four steps. The loss\nof energy at each step is so great that very little usable energy\nremains after four trophic levels.\n\nThere are generally a greater number of individuals at the lower\ntrophic levels of an ecosystem, the greatest number is of the\nproducers.\n\nThe length and complexity of food chains vary greatly. Each organism\nis generally eaten by two or more other kinds of organisms which in\nturn are eaten by several other organisms. So instead of a straight\nline food chain, the relationship can be shown as a series of branching\nlines called a food web (Fig. 13.3).\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nFrom the energy flow diagram (Fig. 13.4),\ntwo things become clear. Firstly, the flow of\nenergy is unidirectional. The energy that is\ncaptured by the autotrophs does not revert\nback to the solar input and the energy which\npasses to the herbivores does not come back\nto autotrophs. As it moves progressively\nthrough the various trophic levels it is no\nlonger available to the previous level.\nSecondly, the energy available at each trophic\nlevel gets diminished progressively due to loss\nof energy at each level.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of food chain\nis how unknowingly some harmful\nchemicals enter our bodies through the food\nchain. You have read in Class [IX how water\ngets polluted. One of the reasons is the use of\nseveral pesticides and other chemicals to\nprotect our crops from diseases and pests.\nThese chemicals are either washed down into\nthe soil or into the water bodies. From the\nsoil, these are absorbed by the plants along\nwith water and minerals, and from the water\nbodies these are taken up by aquatic plants\n\n“Top\n\nFigure 13.3\n\n_ Food web, consisting of\nCa mivores many food chains\n\nFigure 13.4 Diagram showing flow of energy in an ecosystem\n\nOur Environment\n\nReprin\n\n211\n\nit 2025-26\n\n\nand animals. This is one of the ways in which they enter the food chain.\nAs these chemicals are not degradable, these get accumulated\nprogressively at each trophic level. As human beings occupy the top\nlevel in any food chain, the maximum concentration of these chemicals\nget accumulated in our bodies. This phenomenon is known as biological\nmagnification. This is the reason why our food grains such as wheat\nand rice, vegetables and fruits, and even meat, contain varying amounts\nof pesticide residues. They cannot always be removed by washing or\nother means.\n\nvity 13.3\n\n= Newspaper reports about pesticide levels in ready-made food items\nare often seen these days and some states have banned these\nproducts. Debate in groups the need for such bans.\n\n= What do you think would be the source of pesticides in these food\nitems? Could pesticides get into our bodies from this source through\nother food products too?\n\n= Discuss what methods could be applied to reduce our intake of\npesticides.\n\nQ U ES TION S$\n\nWhat are trophic levels? Give an example of a food chain and state the\ndifferent trophic levels in it.\n\nWhat is the role of decomposers in the ecosystem?\n\n13.2 HOW DO OUR ACTIVITIES AFFECT THE\nENVIRONMENT?\n\nWe are an integral part of the environment. Changes in the environment\naffect us and our activities change the environment around us. We have\nalready seen in Class [X how our activities pollute the environment. In\nthis chapter, we shall be looking at two of the environmental problems\nin detail, that is, depletion of the ozone layer and waste disposal.\n\n13.2.1 Ozone Layer and How it is Getting Depleted\n\nOzone (O,) is a molecule formed by three atoms of oxygen. While O,,\nwhich we normally refer to as oxygen, is essential for all aerobic forms of\nlife. Ozone, is a deadly poison. However, at the higher levels of the\natmosphere, ozone performs an essential function. It shields the surface\nof the earth from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. This radiation\n\n212 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nis highly damaging to organisms, for example, it is known to cause skin\ncancer in human beings.\n\nOzone at the higher levels of the atmosphere is a product of UV\nradiation acting on oxygen (O,) molecule. The higher energy UV\nradiations split apart some moleculer oxygen (O,) into free oxygen (O)\natoms. These atoms then combine with the molecular oxygen to form\nozone as shown—\n\n0, —“+0+0\n\n0+0, >0Oz4\n(Ozone)\n\nThe amount of ozone in the atmosphere began to drop sharply in\nthe 1980s. This decrease has been linked to synthetic chemicals like\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used as refrigerants and in fire\nextinguishers. In 1987, the United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP) succeeded in forging an agreement to freeze CFC production at\n1986 levels. It is now mandatory for all the manufacturing companies\nto make CFC-free refrigerators throughout the world.\n\n= Find out from the library, internet or newspaper reports, which\nchemicals are responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer.\n\n= Find out if the regulations put in place to control the emission of\nthese chemicals have succeeded in reducing the damage to the\nozone layer. Has the size of the hole in the ozone layer changed in\nrecent years?\n\n13.2.2 Managing the Garbage we Produce\n\nIn our daily activities, we generate a lot of material that are thrown\naway. What are some of these waste materials? What happens after we\nthrow them away? Let us perform an activity to find answers to these\nquestions.\n\n= Collect waste material from your homes. This could include all\nthe waste generated during a day, like kitchen waste (spoilt food,\nvegetable peels, used tea leaves, milk packets and empty cartons),\nwaste paper, empty medicine bottles/strips/bubble packs, old and\ntorn clothes and broken footwear.\n\n= Bury this material in a pit in the school garden or if there is no\nspace available, you can collect the material in an old bucket/\nflower pot and cover with at least 15 cm of soil.\n\n= Keep this material moist and observe at 15-day intervals.\n\n= What are the materials that remain unchanged over long periods\nof time?\n\n= What are the materials which change their form and structure\nover time?\n\n= Ofthese materials that are changed, which ones change the fastest?\n\nOur Environment\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n213\n\n\nWe have seen in the chapter on ‘Life Processes’ that the food we eat is\ndigested by various enzymes in our body. Have you ever wondered why\nthe same enzyme does not break-down everything we eat? Enzymes are\nspecific in their action, specific enzymes are needed for the break-down\nof a particular substance. That is why we will not get any energy if we\ntry to eat coal! Because of this, many human-made materials like plastics\nwill not be broken down by the action of bacteria or other saprophytes.\nThese materials will be acted upon by physical processes like heat and\npressure, but under the ambient conditions found in our environment,\nthese persist for a long time.\n\nSubstances that are broken down by biological processes are said\nto be biodegradable. How many of the substances you buried were\nbiodegradable? Substances that are not broken down in this manner\nare said to be non-biodegradable. These substances may be inert and\nsimply persist in the environment for a long time or may harm the various\nmembers of the eco-system.\n\nActivity 13.6\n\n= Use the library or internet to find out more about biodegradable\nand non-biodegradable substances.\n\n= How long are various non-biodegradable substances expected to\nlast in our environment?\n\n= These days, new types of plastics which are said to be biodegradable\nare available. Find out more about such materials and whether\nthey do or do not harm the environment.\n\nQ U ES TloON S$\n\nWhy are some substances biodegradable and some non-biodegradable?\n\nGive any two ways in which biodegradable substances would affect the\nenvironment.\n\nGive any two ways in which non-biodegradable substances would affect\nthe environment.\n\nVisit any town or city, and we are sure to find heaps of garbage all over\nthe place. Visit any place of tourist interest and we are sure to find the\nplace littered with empty food wrappers. In the earlier classes we have\ntalked about this problem of dealing with the garbage that we generate. Let\nus now look at the problem a bit more deeply.\n\n214 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n= Find out what happens to the waste generated at home.

Give\nany two methods.\n\nWhat you have learnt\n\nThe various components of an ecosystem are interdependent.\n\nThe producers make the energy from sunlight available to the rest of the ecosystem.\nThere is a loss of energy as we go from one trophic level to the next, this limits the\nnumber of trophic levels in a food-chain.\n\nHuman activities have an impact on the environment.\n\nThe use of chemicals like CFCs has endangered the ozone layer. Since the ozone\n\nlayer protects against the ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, this could damage\nthe environment.\n\nThe waste we generate may be biodegradable or non-biodegradable.\n\nThe disposal of the waste we generate is causing serious environmental problems.\n\nWhich of the following groups contain only biodegradable items?\n(a) Grass, flowers and leather\n\n(b) Grass, wood and plastic\n\n(c) Fruit-peels, cake and lime-juice\n\n(d) Cake, wood and grass\n\nWhich of the following constitute a food-chain?\n\n(a) Grass, wheat and mango\n\n(b) Grass, goat and human\n\n216 Science\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n(c) Goat, cow and elephant\n(d) Grass, fish and goat\n.

Our elders tell\nus that the ‘environment is not what it used to be earlier; others say that\nwe should work in a healthy ‘environment’; and global summits involving\nthe developed and developing countries are regularly held to discuss\n‘environmental’ issues. In this chapter, we shall be studying how various\ncomponents in the environment interact with each other and how we\nimpact the environment.\n\n13.1 ECO-SYSTEM — WHAT ARE ITS COMPONENTS?\n\nAll organisms such as plants, animals, microorganisms and human\nbeings as well as the physical surroundings interact with each other\nand maintain a balance in nature. All the interacting organisms in an\narea together with the non-living constituents of the environment form\nan ecosystem. Thus, an ecosystem consists of biotic components\ncomprising living organisms and abiotic components comprising\nphysical factors like temperature, rainfall, wind, soil and minerals.\n\nFor example, if you visit a garden you will find different plants, such\nas grasses, trees; flower bearing plants like rose, jasmine, sunflower;\nand animals like frogs, insects and birds. All these living organisms\ninteract with each other and their growth, reproduction and other\nactivities are affected by the abiotic components of ecosystem. So a garden\nis an ecosystem. Other types of ecosystems are forests, ponds and lakes.\nThese are natural ecosystems while gardens and crop-fields are human-\nmade (artificial) ecosystems.\n\ni oe eee ey\nctivity 13.1\n\n= You might have seen an aquarium. Let us try to design one.\n\n= What are the things that we need to keep in mind when we create\nan aquarium? The fish would need a free space for swimming (it\ncould be a large jar), water, oxygen and food.\n\n= We can provide oxygen through an oxygen pump (aerator) and\nfish food which is available in the market.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

        "text": "= If we add a few aquatic plants and animals it can become a self-\nsustaining system. Can you think how this happens? An aquarium\nis an example of a human-made ecosystem.\n\n= Can we leave the aquarium as such after we set it up? Why does\nit have to be cleaned once in a while? Do we have to clean ponds\nor lakes in the same manner? Why or why not?\n\nWe have seen in earlier classes that organisms can be grouped as\nproducers, consumers and decomposers according to the manner in\nwhich they obtain their sustenance from the environment. Let us recall\nwhat we have learnt through the self sustaining ecosystem created by\nus above. Which organisms can make organic compounds like sugar\nand starch from inorganic substances using the radiant energy of the\nSun in the presence of chlorophyll? All green plants and certain bacteria\nwhich can produce food by photosynthesis come under this category\nand are called the producers.\n\nOrganisms depend on the producers either directly or indirectly for\ntheir sustenance? These organisms which consume the food produced,\neither directly from producers or indirectly by feeding on other consumers\nare the consumers. Consumers can be classed variously as herbivores,\ncarnivores, omnivores and parasites. Can you give examples for each of\nthese categories of consumers?\n\n= Imagine the situation where you do not clean the aquarium and\nsome fish and plants have died. Have you ever thought what\nhappens when an organism dies? The microorganisms, comprising\nbacteria and fungi, break-down the dead remains and waste\nproducts of organisms. These microorganisms are the decomposers\nas they break-down the complex organic substances into simple\ninorganic substances that go into the soil and are used up once\nmore by the plants. What will happen to the garbage, and dead\nanimals and plants in their absence? Will the natural replenishment\nof the soil take place, even if decomposers are not there?\n\n= While creating an aquarium did you take care not to put an aquatic\nanimal which would eat others? What would have happened\notherwise?\n\n= Make groups and discuss how each of the above groups of\norganisms are dependent on each other.\n\n= Write the aquatic organisms in order of who eats whom and form\n\na chain of at least three steps. > >\n\n= Would you consider any one group of organisms to be of primary\nimportance?

This series or organisms taking part at\nvarious biotic levels form a food chain (Fig. 13.1).\n\nEach step or level of the food chain forms a trophic level.\nThe autotrophs or the producers are at the first trophic level.\nThey fix up the solar energy and make it available for\nheterotrophs or the consumers. The herbivores or the primary\nconsumers come at the second, small carnivores or the\nsecondary consumers at the third and larger carnivores or\nthe tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level (Fig. 13.2).\n\nWe know that the food we eat acts as a fuel to provide us\nenergy to do work. Thus the interactions among various\ncomponents of the environment involves flow of energy from\none component of the system to another. As we have studied,\nthe autotrophs capture the energy present in sunlight and\nconvert it into chemical energy. This energy supports all the\nactivities of the living world. From autotrophs, the energy goes\nto the heterotrophs and decomposers. However, as we saw in\nthe previous Chapter on ‘Sources of Energy’, when one form\nof energy is changed to another, some energy is lost to the\nenvironment in forms which cannot be used again. The flow\nof energy between various components of the environment\nhas been extensively studied and it has been found that —\nThe green plants in a terrestrial ecosystem capture about\n1% of the energy of sunlight that falls on their leaves and convert it\ninto food energy.\n\nWhen green plants are eaten by primary consumers, a great deal\nof energy is lost as heat to the environment, some amount goes\ninto digestion and in doing work and the rest goes towards growth\nand reproduction. An average of 10% of the food eaten is turned\ninto its own body and made available for the next level of\nconsumers.\n\nTherefore, 10% can be taken as the average value for the amount\nof organic matter that is present at each step and reaches the next\nlevel of consumers.\n\nSince so little energy is available for the next level of consumers,\nfood chains generally consist of only three or four steps. The loss\nof energy at each step is so great that very little usable energy\nremains after four trophic levels.\n\nThere are generally a greater number of individuals at the lower\ntrophic levels of an ecosystem, the greatest number is of the\nproducers.\n\nThe length and complexity of food chains vary greatly. Each organism\nis generally eaten by two or more other kinds of organisms which in\nturn are eaten by several other organisms. So instead of a straight\nline food chain, the relationship can be shown as a series of branching\nlines called a food web (Fig. 13.3).\n\nScience\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

        "text": "From the energy flow diagram (Fig. 13.4),\ntwo things become clear. Firstly, the flow of\nenergy is unidirectional. The energy that is\ncaptured by the autotrophs does not revert\nback to the solar input and the energy which\npasses to the herbivores does not come back\nto autotrophs. As it moves progressively\nthrough the various trophic levels it is no\nlonger available to the previous level.\nSecondly, the energy available at each trophic\nlevel gets diminished progressively due to loss\nof energy at each level.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of food chain\nis how unknowingly some harmful\nchemicals enter our bodies through the food\nchain. You have read in Class [IX how water\ngets polluted. One of the reasons is the use of\nseveral pesticides and other chemicals to\nprotect our crops from diseases and pests.\nThese chemicals are either washed down into\nthe soil or into the water bodies. From the\nsoil, these are absorbed by the plants along\nwith water and minerals, and from the water\nbodies these are taken up by aquatic plants\n\n“Top\n\nFigure 13.3\n\n_ Food web, consisting of\nCa mivores many food chains\n\nFigure 13.4 Diagram showing flow of energy in an ecosystem\n\nOur Environment\n\nReprin\n\n211\n\nit 2025-26\n",

As human beings occupy the top\nlevel in any food chain, the maximum concentration of these chemicals\nget accumulated in our bodies. This phenomenon is known as biological\nmagnification. This is the reason why our food grains such as wheat\nand rice, vegetables and fruits, and even meat, contain varying amounts\nof pesticide residues. They cannot always be removed by washing or\nother means.\n\nvity 13.3\n\n= Newspaper reports about pesticide levels in ready-made food items\nare often seen these days and some states have banned these\nproducts.

Changes in the environment\naffect us and our activities change the environment around us. We have\nalready seen in Class [X how our activities pollute the environment. In\nthis chapter, we shall be looking at two of the environmental problems\nin detail, that is, depletion of the ozone layer and waste disposal.\n\n13.2.1 Ozone Layer and How it is Getting Depleted\n\nOzone (O,) is a molecule formed by three atoms of oxygen. While O,,\nwhich we normally refer to as oxygen, is essential for all aerobic forms of\nlife. Ozone, is a deadly poison. However, at the higher levels of the\natmosphere, ozone performs an essential function. It shields the surface\nof the earth from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun.

These atoms then combine with the molecular oxygen to form\nozone as shown—\n\n0, —“+0+0\n\n0+0, >0Oz4\n(Ozone)\n\nThe amount of ozone in the atmosphere began to drop sharply in\nthe 1980s. This decrease has been linked to synthetic chemicals like\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used as refrigerants and in fire\nextinguishers. In 1987, the United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP) succeeded in forging an agreement to freeze CFC production at\n1986 levels. It is now mandatory for all the manufacturing companies\nto make CFC-free refrigerators throughout the world.\n\n= Find out from the library, internet or newspaper reports, which\nchemicals are responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer.\n\n= Find out if the regulations put in place to control the emission of\nthese chemicals have succeeded in reducing the damage to the\nozone layer.

What are some of these waste materials? What happens after we\nthrow them away? Let us perform an activity to find answers to these\nquestions.\n\n= Collect waste material from your homes. This could include all\nthe waste generated during a day, like kitchen waste (spoilt food,\nvegetable peels, used tea leaves, milk packets and empty cartons),\nwaste paper, empty medicine bottles/strips/bubble packs, old and\ntorn clothes and broken footwear.\n\n= Bury this material in a pit in the school garden or if there is no\nspace available, you can collect the material in an old bucket/\nflower pot and cover with at least 15 cm of soil.\n\n= Keep this material moist and observe at 15-day intervals.\n\n= What are the materials that remain unchanged over long periods\nof time?\n\n= What are the materials which change their form and structure\nover time?\n\n= Ofthese materials that are changed, which ones change the fastest?\n\nOur Environment\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n213\n",

That is why we will not get any energy if we\ntry to eat coal!

This principle marks a departure\nfrom the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes\na gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed\non the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt\nto discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different\nsubject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction\nof a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education\n(1986).\n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers\nwill take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative\nactivities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children\ngenerate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key\nreasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity\nand initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning,\nnot as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\n\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.\nFlexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual\ncalendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching.\nThe methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this\ntextbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a\nsource of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of\ncurricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The\ntextbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to\nopportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and\nactivities requiring hands-on experience.\n\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates\nthe hard work done by the textbook development team responsible for this book. We\nwish to thank the Chairman of the advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor\nJ.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor Rupamanjari Ghosh, School\nof Physical Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, for guiding the work of\nthis committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we\nare grateful to them and their principals for making this possible.

We are especially grateful to the members of\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nthe National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and\nHigher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development under the Chairmanship\nof Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P.

The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing\nthe content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with\ncreative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the\nexercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes\nalready developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into\nconsideration in this exercise.\n\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:\nOverlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the\nsame class\nSimilar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject\nDifficulty level\n\nContent, which is easily accessible to students without much\ninterventions from teachers and can be learned by children through\nself-learning or peer-learning\n\nContent, which is irrelevant in the present context\n\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the\nchanges given above.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nThis textbook of Science for Class X is a continuation of our attempt in the Class IX\nScience textbook to comply with the guidelines of the National Curriculum\nFramework-2005. We had to work within a limited time frame and also had our own\nconstraints coming in the way of this radical change. The revised and re-structured\nsyllabus for Class X covers selected topics in the broad themes of — Materials,\nThe World of the Living, How Things Work, Natural Phenomena and Natural Resources.\nWe have interpreted the syllabus to present a coherent coverage of scientific concepts\nrelated to our daily life on the select topics. It is an integrated approach to science at\nthis level, with no sharp divisions into disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry, Biology\nand Environmental Science.\n\nThere has been a conscious attempt to address the relevant social concerns in this\nscience textbook wherever possible — the concerns for people with special needs, the\nissues of gender discrimination, energy and environment have found their natural\nplace in this book. Students have been encouraged to get into the debates on some of\nthe management concerns (for sustainable development, for example) so that they\ncan arrive at their own decisions after a scientific analysis of all the facts.\n\nThis book has some features which are meant to enhance its effectiveness. The\ntheme of each chapter has been introduced with examples from daily life, and if possible,\nby a relevant activity that the students have to perform. The entire approach of the\nbook is, in fact, activity-based, i.e., the students are required to construct knowledge\nthemselves from these activities. The emphasis is not on definitions and technical\nterms, but on the concepts involved. Special care has been taken so that the rigour of\nscience is not lost while simplifying the language. Difficult and challenging ideas,\nwhich are not to be covered at this stage, have often been placed as extra material in\nthe boxes in light orange. The excitement of doing science comes from pursuing the\nunknown — the students would have the opportunity to think and explore somewhat\nbeyond the syllabus and may feel the urge to continue their scientific expedition at\nhigher levels. All such box items, including brief biography of scientists, are, of course,\nnon-evaluative.\n\nSolved examples are provided, wherever felt necessary, to clarify a concept. The\nin-text questions after a main section are for the students to check their understanding\nof the topic. At the end of each chapter, there is a quick review of the important points\ncovered in the chapter. We have introduced some multiple choice questions in the\nexercises. There are problems of different difficulty levels answers to the multiple-\nchoice questions and numericals, and hints for the difficult questions are included at\nthe end of the book.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nThis book has been made possible because of the active participation of many\npeople. I wish to thank Professor Krishna Kumar, Director, NCERT, Prof. G. Ravindra,\nJoint Director, NCERT, and Professor Hukum Singh, Head, Department of Education\nin Science and Mathematics, NCERT, specially for their keen interest in the development\nof the book and for all the administrative support. I wish to put on record my sincere\nappreciation for Dr Anjni Koul, the member-coordinator of the textbook development\ncommittee, for her extraordinary commitment and efficiency. It has been a real pleasure\nworking with my textbook development team and the review committee. The chosen\neditorial team worked extremely hard, on tight deadlines, to bring the book close to\nthe shape that we dreamt of. Fruitful discussions with some members of the MHRD\nMonitoring Committee helped in providing the final touches to the book. I do not have\n\nthe words to acknowledge the professional and personal inputs I received from some\n\nof my close friends during the preparation of this book. We warmly welcome comments\nand suggestions for improvement from our readers.\n\nRUPAMANJARI GHOSH\n\nProfessor of Physics\n\nSchool of Physical Sciences\nJawaharlal Nehru University\nNew Delhi\n\n(viii)\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\nTEXTBOOK DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE\n\nCHAIRMAN, ADVISORY GROUP FOR TEXTBOOKS IN SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS\n\nJ.V.
